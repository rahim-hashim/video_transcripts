# Joe Rogan Experience #2061 - Whitney Cummings
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5.8s)]
*  Like could that have do's labor getting in a cold plunge eight months pregnant? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9.6s)]
*  Ask Jamie, he would know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=16.76s)]
*  Jamie, get on that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=18.6s)]
*  I'm sure there's a Reddit forum for that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=19.6s)]
*  Last time I tried. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=20.8s)]
*  Last night with those smelling salts, people doing the smelling salts, I was like, if I [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=23.16s)]
*  even inhale that, I feel like I'm going to start crowning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=26.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's very funny how those smelling salts have made their way from the studio to now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=29.04s)]
*  at the club. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=35.08s)]
*  Everybody's doing smelling salts between the kratom and the smelling salts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  You got to keep the kratom away from Duncan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  That motherfucker drinks cases of that stuff. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=43.56s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=46.08s)]
*  We get there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=47.96s)]
*  And is kratom naturally occurring? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  It's like a plant. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, that stuff is the live free or whatever it's called. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=53.72s)]
*  What are those things called, Jamie? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=58.72s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=61.08s)]
*  Live free? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=62.44s)]
*  That's the brand? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=63.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=64.56s)]
*  But they used to have them at Sun Life, you know that place? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=65.72s)]
*  Organics? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=70.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=71.16s)]
*  But then you're not supposed to drink. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=72.0s)]
*  They're that big. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=74.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=75.12s)]
*  And you're supposed to drink a half a bottle. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=75.4s)]
*  But they're not clear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=77.2s)]
*  So you have to kind of like hold it up to the light to see where half is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=79.36s)]
*  You get a guess like what half is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=82.32s)]
*  And a lot of people were just drinking the whole thing and they were getting fucked up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there was a time when you were out of town and I was in the mothership and everyone [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=88.0s)]
*  was doing like four or five things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=91.4s)]
*  I was like, you guys, when Joe leaves, we can't all just get addicted to drugs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=93.0s)]
*  When you're out of town, it is a little different up there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=98.8s)]
*  It's kind of an opiate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=101.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=103.64s)]
*  What exactly is kratom? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=104.56s)]
*  And it's legal? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=106.36s)]
*  It's legal? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=107.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's legal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=108.6s)]
*  Totally. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=109.6s)]
*  I had a guy that was on my podcast once that used to be an opiate addict. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=110.2s)]
*  And then he started taking kratom. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=113.8s)]
*  And they were selling it as pills. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=116.2s)]
*  And he said, well, if you take a small amount of it, it actually acts as like a stimulant. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=118.32s)]
*  But if you take a larger amount of it, it's a different effect. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=121.88s)]
*  So I said, how many do you take? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=125.12s)]
*  He says, I take 10. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=126.52s)]
*  I go, you take 10. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=128.44s)]
*  He goes, I take 10 before I work out. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=130.16s)]
*  I'm like, OK, I'll try it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=131.76s)]
*  So I took 10. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=133.48s)]
*  I was high as fuck. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=135.04s)]
*  It's a weird high. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=138.48s)]
*  I felt like I'm pretty aware of my body. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, my motor skills feel perfect. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=146.64s)]
*  I don't feel like anything's wrong. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=149.72s)]
*  I feel like I could go do stuff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not like, ugh, drunk or anything like that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=153.56s)]
*  I go, but I'm definitely affected. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=157.0s)]
*  So would this affect judgment? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Would this affect your reaction time? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=162.32s)]
*  I shouldn't drive like this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=164.88s)]
*  The pain tolerance down, that's probably good for working out. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=166.4s)]
*  I guess. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=168.76s)]
*  Is it, though? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=170.0s)]
*  I did kind of used to like to smoke weed and work out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=170.84s)]
*  I like smoking weed and working out. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=173.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, smoking weed and working out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=174.56s)]
*  makes me feel like I know what my muscles are doing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, you feel every focusing more. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=180.8s)]
*  Fibers and shit. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=183.56s)]
*  You know what it's really good for? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=185.28s)]
*  Technique. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=186.84s)]
*  When you learn martial arts technique, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=188.44s)]
*  there's certain things about kicking a bag in particular. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=191.84s)]
*  When I haven't smoked weed, I mean, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=196.32s)]
*  I've been doing it my whole life, so I know how to do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=199.84s)]
*  But then if I smoke weed, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=202.08s)]
*  I feel like where the little leverage points are, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=204.6s)]
*  I feel like where the torque comes in, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=210.12s)]
*  I feel like the weight distribution. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=212.68s)]
*  It's like just you're more sensitive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=216.56s)]
*  Just more present in your body. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=218.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=219.8s)]
*  It makes you so much better at pool. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=220.72s)]
*  It makes my pool game like, yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=222.88s)]
*  There's a term in pool like a ball. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Like say if we were playing nine ball [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=228.0s)]
*  and you were better than me, you would give me the eight ball. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=229.96s)]
*  That means it's a big advantage to have the eight ball. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  That means I don't just win by making the nine ball. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  I can make the nine ball or the eight ball. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=237.08s)]
*  So that's like, it gives you a ball. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=239.28s)]
*  That means, so like when I smoke pot, I'm one ball better. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=241.84s)]
*  Like legitimately. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=246.72s)]
*  I'm like 10% better easily, maybe more. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=247.76s)]
*  Is there any in pool like shade on taking Adderall [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=251.44s)]
*  or smoking weed or there's no like, no one cares? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=255.24s)]
*  Yeah, people talk shit about you, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=257.48s)]
*  but they all do it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=258.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=259.88s)]
*  Like pool players are notorious drug addicts. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  They're fucking. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=263.32s)]
*  Cocaine's probably great for pool. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=265.68s)]
*  There's, I've met more, I didn't even know drugs. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=266.52s)]
*  I didn't really understand drug culture [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=270.04s)]
*  when I started hanging around in pool halls [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=271.96s)]
*  because I had gone from being a fighter to being a comedian. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=274.28s)]
*  So in fighting, there's no drinking, no partying, no nothing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=279.04s)]
*  All throughout high school, I was like, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=282.44s)]
*  very rarely did I imbibe in anything. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=284.36s)]
*  I was all just about competition. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=287.84s)]
*  And then I started hanging out with comedians [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  and the ones that were doing drugs, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  like God, their life was falling apart. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=294.4s)]
*  These people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=296.11999999999995s)]
*  And then I started hanging out in this pool hall [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=296.96s)]
*  and they were all doing drugs. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=299.64s)]
*  Everybody was doing something. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=301.96s)]
*  There was guys doing heroin. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=303.52s)]
*  There was guys that were crack addicts. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=305.44s)]
*  Like one of my best friends was a crack addict. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  Have you seen this video where Boozy the rapper [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=309.88s)]
*  is endorsing crack over fentanyl? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=312.08s)]
*  Have you seen, dude, it's so. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=314.16s)]
*  Well, it's a good point. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  Crack heads live. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=319.6s)]
*  He's like, my crack head friends I've known for 20 years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=320.72s)]
*  He's like, they're around. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  They can do anything. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=324.68s)]
*  They have powers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, crack is just cocaine. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  It's just another way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  And you just cooked. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  It's yeah, it's free base in cocaine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=332.92s)]
*  And the scary thing is even though we know that, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  it's one of the most racist laws that's ever been enacted [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  where the difference between the sentencing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  for someone who gets caught with crack [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=347.52s)]
*  versus someone who gets caught [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=350.08s)]
*  with an equivalent amount of cocaine. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=351.44s)]
*  It's like a giant disparity. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=352.8s)]
*  Do you want to say this too? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=354.88s)]
*  He's the most absolute person. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=356.16s)]
*  Oh, I don't know who that is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=357.2s)]
*  That's it's Boozy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=359.72s)]
*  B-O-S-I. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=361.72s)]
*  I know this is also. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=362.56s)]
*  You've ever been on a field with? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  No, my cousin June Bull. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=364.56s)]
*  He was a crack head and a good dude though. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=366.64s)]
*  But he was very athletic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=369.68s)]
*  because he was still stuff when I came home from college [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=370.68s)]
*  could never catch him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=372.68s)]
*  He could never catch him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=373.8s)]
*  And he was selling. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=374.96s)]
*  And I would have to go get it back at the hood [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=376.24s)]
*  and from the drug dealers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=378.56s)]
*  He was probably the most athletic, my cousin June Bull. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=380.24s)]
*  But next to that, I think it was both. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=383.08s)]
*  His cousin June Bull. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=385.08s)]
*  Imagine there's some dude out there, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=389.4s)]
*  June Bull, the crack head, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=391.04s)]
*  that's more athletic than a guy who is widely regarded [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=392.92s)]
*  as being one of the most athletic humans that's ever lived. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=396.96s)]
*  And then the Boozy one is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  June Bug's more athletic than Bo Jackson. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=402.76s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=405.6s)]
*  June Bug, the bird crasher of the hood. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=406.44s)]
*  There was this dude I've talked about many times, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=408.88s)]
*  but his name was Water Dog. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=411.16s)]
*  That was his nickname. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=412.56s)]
*  Or they would call him Buffalo Bill. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  And he was this pool player and he would do heroin. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=415.0s)]
*  So he would go into the bathroom and shut the door. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=418.56s)]
*  And he'd be in there for 20 minutes [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=422.48s)]
*  and everybody knew what he was doing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=423.8s)]
*  And then he'd go out and he'd sit on a bar stool like this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=425.04s)]
*  With his hands in front of him like a bird. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  T-Rex, yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=432.08s)]
*  Yeah, and just like this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=432.92s)]
*  And he would sit there for like 20 minutes. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=434.76s)]
*  Just, and then he would get down and he had like gerbil eyes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  They're like black eyes and he couldn't miss. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=440.56s)]
*  He would play pool, he just wouldn't miss. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=443.2s)]
*  He just couldn't miss. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=445.36s)]
*  Like he knew how much time he needed for it to calibrate. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=446.2s)]
*  And then when. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=448.8s)]
*  He was so accurate. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=449.92s)]
*  It was stunning. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=451.56s)]
*  He had no nerves. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=453.16s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=454.64s)]
*  He didn't feel anything. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=455.48s)]
*  Cause pool is gambling. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=456.64s)]
*  The reason why it's called pool, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  it's pocket billiards is the name of the game. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=460.32s)]
*  But pool is pooling money together to gamble. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=462.08s)]
*  So like the real pool players, almost all of them gambled. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=465.16s)]
*  And takes away inhibitions so you're not. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=468.12s)]
*  He had no fear. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=469.88s)]
*  He had no nerves. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=471.44s)]
*  He would just fire these balls into the hole. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=473.2s)]
*  And it's like really tight pocketed table [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=475.92s)]
*  playing for like $10,000. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=478.24s)]
*  And I was like, this is nuts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=480.76s)]
*  I wonder what it's like. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=482.52s)]
*  I've never done heroin. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=483.36s)]
*  Must be pretty awesome if people are trading their kids [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=484.88s)]
*  for it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=488.96s)]
*  Yeah, I got morphine when I had my knee surgery once. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  It was like, by the way, if you hear me [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=492.88s)]
*  and I sound funny, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  I just got a cold punch. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=496.08s)]
*  I just got out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=497.64s)]
*  So I'm like, so if I sound like I'm on heroin, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=500.28s)]
*  I'm just cold. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=503.76s)]
*  But. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=505.88s)]
*  I wanna do it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  What was I saying? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=507.56s)]
*  I do it heroin and it takes all your fears away. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  The inhibitions when you did methadone? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=510.52s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  So no, it was morphine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=513.28s)]
*  What was it, sorry? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=515.12s)]
*  I wonder what that's like. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=515.96s)]
*  What was it morphine? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=516.8s)]
*  What does methadone's like in comparison to. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=517.64s)]
*  Is methadone basically Adderall? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=519.4s)]
*  Like we've done Adderall. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=520.88s)]
*  I think it's like a kind of an opiate, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  but it doesn't get you high. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=524.68s)]
*  It just makes you stupid. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=525.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=527.08s)]
*  But. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=527.92s)]
*  We can go to San Francisco and get some. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=528.74s)]
*  I think you can just walk in now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=530.08s)]
*  It's pretty easy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=531.4s)]
*  You don't even have to have a prescription. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=532.24s)]
*  It's a drive through now. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=533.08s)]
*  I had a knee surgery and when I was in the hospital, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=534.92s)]
*  they had me on a morphine drip. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=537.6s)]
*  And apparently, this is in the 90s. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=539.52s)]
*  I don't know if they still do this, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  but you could hit a button [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=542.68s)]
*  and when you hit a button, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=544.4s)]
*  you would get more morphine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=545.36s)]
*  And it was wonderful. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=547.0s)]
*  It was wonderful. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=548.16s)]
*  Have we ever done fentanyl at the doctor? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=549.4s)]
*  If I've gotten a surgery, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=552.08s)]
*  could I have I done fentanyl? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=553.04s)]
*  Or is that propofol? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=554.76s)]
*  Propofol. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=556.4s)]
*  Propofol is the stuff that puts you under. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=557.22s)]
*  Fentanyl is a prescription drug though. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=560.8s)]
*  They give people fentanyl patches. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=563.56s)]
*  There's prescription. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=566.04s)]
*  It's just so strong. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=568.32s)]
*  What is it like a hundred times stronger [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=570.24s)]
*  than heroin or something? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=572.0s)]
*  You wanna see the boozy? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=572.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=573.66s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=574.5s)]
*  It's so epic. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=575.34s)]
*  It's just. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=577.2s)]
*  People, just stop taking fentanyl [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=581.52s)]
*  and go back to crack. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=583.2s)]

*  And they were like putting beavers in blenders. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=749.52s)]
*  Beavers in blenders. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, didn't they in wild, wild country, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=752.8s)]
*  they were putting like squirrels and beavers [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=754.16s)]
*  in blenders and stuff to make everybody sick [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=755.56s)]

*  And put like bacteria so people had such bad diarrhea [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=762.68s)]
*  they didn't go vote. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  That was that Sheila lady. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=766.28s)]
*  Sheila. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  She was scary. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=768.04s)]
*  To that bitch. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=768.88s)]
*  That bitch is scary. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  I would not fuck with her. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=770.56s)]
*  I would not fuck with her. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=771.4s)]
*  That was scary. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=772.24s)]
*  Tough titties, wasn't it that? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  So I have this haricune in my yard [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=774.76s)]
*  and it's acting really weird and I'm poking at it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=777.56s)]
*  It's in, you know, because the way they sleep [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  is they just like, you know, sort of bend over a branch [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=781.48s)]
*  or whatever, but I was poking at it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=784.36s)]
*  It wasn't moving, it wasn't behaving like a raccoon. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=785.44s)]
*  And so I call animal control. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=787.48s)]
*  This is like the most California fucking response. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=788.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I have this raccoon in my tree [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=791.16s)]
*  and she's like, yeah, that's where they live. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=793.04s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, no, this is where I live bitch. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=795.2s)]
*  Get the, it's sick, something's wrong with it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=796.96s)]
*  Last thing I need is a fucking coyote eating it [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  and then we have rabid coyotes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  I'd have to deal with that shit. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=802.64s)]
*  And she goes, well, a lot of the wild animals [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=804.32s)]
*  in California are acting really weird right now [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=806.12s)]
*  because people are testing their cocaine for fentanyl [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=808.0s)]
*  and if it tests positive, they flush it down the toilet [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=810.44s)]
*  so there's fentanyl in the water. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=812.48s)]
*  So the coyotes and raccoons are acting really weird. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=813.6400000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what she said? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=818.0s)]
*  Yes, I was like, if you're telling me [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=818.84s)]
*  there's fentanyl coyotes, I gotta get the fuck out of here. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=820.44s)]
*  But how, wait a minute, what about people? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=823.96s)]
*  Do people get that water? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  How is that, where's that water going? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=828.12s)]
*  I mean, they already probably, they just. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=829.48s)]
*  Where's that, like, does that mean that waste water [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=831.8000000000001s)]
*  from a toilet flushing goes out into the streets? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  What is this, Rome? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=839.2800000000001s)]
*  Probably. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=841.2s)]
*  This is how they started the black plague. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=842.04s)]
*  Headed for the same fate, it seems. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=842.88s)]
*  Well, that's what started a lot of the plagues. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=845.2s)]
*  Like, people had terrible hygiene back there, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=848.24s)]
*  terrible sanitation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=851.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=852.88s)]
*  There's a book called Dissolving Illusions [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=853.72s)]
*  and it's about the invention of vaccines [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=856.2s)]
*  and the conditions that people lived in. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=859.04s)]
*  In like the early 1900s in major cities, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=863.24s)]
*  like, you don't think about it, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=866.2s)]
*  but if people didn't have trucks, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=867.8s)]
*  because trucks didn't exist, like, how did they shit? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=871.64s)]
*  Where did they, how did they get their food? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=875.28s)]
*  Well, guess what, they didn't. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=877.16s)]
*  They didn't get good food. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=878.76s)]
*  So they didn't get any fresh vegetables, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  no one's getting any vitamins, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=882.12s)]
*  and everywhere's like an open sewer. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=883.68s)]
*  They had like these equivalent to like large outhouses [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=886.3599999999999s)]
*  on these blocks and it's just horrible sanitation. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=889.7199999999999s)]
*  Horses shit eight times a day. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  They're walking through horse shit. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=896.04s)]
*  That mud was all shit. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=898.16s)]
*  But that's probably the most sanitary shit [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=899.0s)]
*  they're walking through, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=901.8s)]
*  because horses are just eating grass, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  but humans, we're eating meat and all kinds of other stuff [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  and it's fucking coming out of your ass. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=909.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, dog shit smells so much worse than deer shit. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=911.88s)]
*  Like, deer shit doesn't smell like anything. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=915.36s)]
*  Like little pellets, yeah, yeah, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=916.68s)]
*  they're hard little pellets. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=917.52s)]
*  Yeah, it smells like nothing, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=918.36s)]
*  because they just eat grass. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  They eat grass, they shit grass. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=920.56s)]
*  It's like just grass going through their digestive system. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  But dog shit's just like, what did you eat, Sally? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=924.8s)]
*  Sally's over there eating dead raccoons and squirrels. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=929.4799999999999s)]
*  People used to die of just dysentery. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=932.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=935.28s)]
*  Like it was just a, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=936.12s)]
*  if you had one cut and walked down the street, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  you're just- [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=938.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, how about staph infections? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  People almost die of staph, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=940.12s)]
*  well, they probably do die of staph infections today [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=941.3599999999999s)]
*  if they don't get it taken care of, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=943.28s)]
*  but staph infections are scary as shit. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=944.64s)]
*  And people have always got those. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=947.88s)]
*  You just get cut and you'd get infected. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=949.24s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=951.8s)]
*  I mean, it's like, yeah, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=952.64s)]
*  sort of issues now with depression and anxiety. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=953.72s)]
*  Back then you had such real things to worry about, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=955.72s)]
*  like how do I get home without getting covered in shit, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=958.04s)]
*  without getting dysentery? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=960.76s)]
*  There was no time to be depressed. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=962.48s)]
*  There was no time, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  that was the only thing to be anxious about. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=964.64s)]
*  Well, you were always vulnerable. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=965.96s)]
*  I mean, think about all the times when you were a kid [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  where you got hurt. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=969.36s)]
*  Like when I was a kid, I broke my arm once, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=971.12s)]
*  you know, you fall down, you gotta go to the doctor, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=973.48s)]
*  you get this and that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=975.6s)]
*  Back then, kids just died. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=976.44s)]
*  They just died. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=978.44s)]
*  You get a broken leg, you're dead. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=979.28s)]
*  That was it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=981.12s)]
*  But also I'm fascinated, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=981.96s)]
*  because I'm about to have a kid [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=983.56s)]
*  and I wanna make sure he has a little adversity. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=984.4s)]
*  And I was with a friend of mine at the playgrounds now, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=987.0s)]
*  they're like rubbery and they're all made of plastic. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  When's the last time you saw a kid in a cast? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=994.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  I see him occasionally. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=998.28s)]
*  Every kid's in Texas, so kids do normal shit. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=999.76s)]
*  But I remember, there used to be a cast with a metal bar [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1002.5999999999999s)]
*  when I was in school. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  It was a metal bar. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1008.16s)]
*  Remember kids with- They go to your hip. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1009.24s)]
*  The people would have one and it went all the way. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1010.48s)]
*  It was about the first 45 minutes of school signing casts. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1012.72s)]
*  Like everyone was in a cast when we were kids. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1015.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1017.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1018.16s)]
*  Remember the seesaws are gone? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1020.4s)]
*  Slides used to be made of sheet metal. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1021.22s)]
*  They're like plastic. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1024.2s)]
*  Do you remember there was like a chain, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1025.16s)]
*  like a pirate ship chain we would climb up? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1026.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1028.76s)]
*  Like we could tetanus getting pinched. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1029.6s)]
*  Like- Seesaws. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1031.24s)]
*  Dude, what was more dangerous than a seesaw? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1032.64s)]
*  You put it up in the air and your fat friend [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1035.08s)]
*  jumps on the top of it and you go flying. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1037.88s)]
*  You were the- you were always the asshole. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1039.76s)]
*  You'd just be on the bottom and wait [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1041.32s)]
*  and then step off it and just watch them [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1043.08s)]
*  careen to the ground. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1045.0s)]
*  It was just- Dude, we used to play bloody knuckles all day. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1045.84s)]
*  Like we would just punch each other in the knuckle. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1050.2s)]
*  We would just be bleeding at all times. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1052.24s)]
*  How about those things that spin around? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1053.84s)]
*  Where you spin your friends around as fast as possible. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1055.56s)]
*  You know the ones where you're like hanging on, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1058.72s)]
*  it's just a wheel. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1060.52s)]
*  It's not really a merry-go-round. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1061.72s)]
*  It's much smaller. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1063.0s)]
*  But you'd be spinning that motherfucker [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1064.0s)]
*  and you'd grab your friends. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1066.08s)]
*  You'd try to like literally make them fly off. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1067.32s)]
*  It's just a lazy Susan for pedophiles. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1069.56s)]
*  Kids in the park. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1071.8799999999999s)]
*  Just, yeah, I would get stuck under. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1073.0s)]
*  You'd get under the merry-go-round. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1075.2s)]
*  Remember the jungle gym where you would just- [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1077.04s)]
*  It was like scaffolding basically. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1080.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1082.2s)]
*  And you'd just hang upside down with no ability to- [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1083.04s)]
*  On the concrete. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1087.32s)]
*  We used to play in tires. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  We would just get in a tire and roll down a hill. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1089.8799999999999s)]
*  That was just a game. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1091.96s)]
*  Normal shit. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1092.8s)]
*  We did play on concrete. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1095.76s)]
*  And there was like little- [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1096.6s)]
*  It was just like a construction site [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1097.48s)]
*  is basically what we used to play on. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, kids today, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1100.88s)]
*  unless you live in a terrible neighborhood, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1103.0800000000002s)]
*  that's not generally the case. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1106.72s)]
*  It's like mushy now, although I was- [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1107.56s)]
*  But isn't that smart? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1111.16s)]
*  What? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1112.8s)]
*  I know, we're like, let's go back to how it was. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1113.64s)]
*  I don't want these kids to get hurt. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1114.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1116.48s)]
*  Did you see this video a couple months ago [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1117.3200000000002s)]
*  where this cop goes down the slide [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  at an enormously fast speed? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I think I did. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1121.48s)]
*  No. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1122.3200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make sense at how he gets to speed. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1123.16s)]
*  So you see the slide right here. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  I'll play it real fast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1125.24s)]
*  But it doesn't make sense how he gets going this fast. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1126.08s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1128.6799999999998s)]
*  Is he gonna get hurt? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1129.52s)]
*  I mean, he probably did. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1130.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1132.0s)]
*  He's flying down the slide backwards. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1133.96s)]
*  Face first, or face. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1136.84s)]
*  Well, that's a really dumb way to do it, first of all. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1140.56s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1143.32s)]
*  Why did he do it belly down? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1144.32s)]
*  That just seems like- [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1146.12s)]
*  The whole thing doesn't make sense. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1147.12s)]
*  That's like an ad for Kratom. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1148.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't know, he seemed like he wasn't totally conscious [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  when he came out. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1153.08s)]
*  Not a lot of people wanna be cops these days. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  Tough job. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1156.92s)]
*  Sometimes you don't get the best or the brightest. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1157.76s)]
*  It's kinda true. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1160.2s)]
*  Why is he fucking undued? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1161.92s)]
*  What if he breaks a leg? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1163.56s)]
*  What if he broke his ankle flying out of that fucking thing? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1165.04s)]
*  Worker's comps. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1167.92s)]
*  Does he even get worker's comp for that? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1169.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1170.96s)]
*  I'm like, sorry, dude. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1171.8s)]
*  But it is wild, I think, how much more physically [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1173.0s)]
*  we used to have to contend with. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1177.68s)]
*  Yeah, but you can get your kid into Jitsu. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1180.52s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1183.2s)]
*  Your kid can 100% experience adversity [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1185.08s)]
*  under controlled circumstances, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1188.76s)]
*  which is probably way better anyway. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1190.48s)]
*  And even tolerate boredom. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1192.24s)]
*  My mom used to say, go out and entertain yourself. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1194.04s)]
*  Go out and play, come back before dark. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1198.68s)]
*  We used to be able, is that illegal now? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1200.8s)]
*  You could do it in certain neighborhoods. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1203.0s)]
*  You could do it more here than you can in other places. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1205.04s)]
*  But yeah, people don't do that anymore. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1207.8s)]
*  You would just fuck around and find out. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1209.92s)]
*  You would just put your finger in a light socket all day. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1211.2s)]
*  Well, I don't think parents knew as much. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1215.44s)]
*  And I don't think there was as much of a fear of predators. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1218.0s)]
*  I have a friend whose kid almost got kidnapped. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1222.4s)]
*  He's at a park. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1226.88s)]
*  And he had looked down or wasn't paying attention for, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know how long, looking at his phone. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1234.96s)]
*  And then he looks up, and there's [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1237.0800000000002s)]
*  a guy who's reaching for his son's hand [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1238.6s)]
*  and taking him towards a van. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1241.8s)]
*  Why is it always a van? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  Because that's the best way to carry someone around. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1246.36s)]
*  Like you open the door real quick, throw him in, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1248.6399999999999s)]
*  shut the door. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1250.52s)]
*  So also there's no windows. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess that's the case. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1254.36s)]
*  And he fucking runs over and stops it before it happens. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1255.6s)]
*  But he was so freaked out. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1258.28s)]
*  What if he didn't look up from his phone? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  The kids are playing around with other kids, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1263.56s)]
*  and you get bored, and you just start looking at your phone. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1265.48s)]
*  What if he didn't? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1268.8s)]
*  My dad was like, I had that stupid nude leak thing happen. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1271.24s)]
*  So I have this IT guy who was explaining to me, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1275.56s)]
*  I'm like, what's the hygiene for kids on Instagram? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1278.6s)]
*  I probably just won't put them on Instagram. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1282.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1285.28s)]
*  But he was like, the way that predators pick up kids now [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1286.28s)]
*  is they basically just collect information [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1289.16s)]
*  from the parents' Instagram. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1291.4s)]
*  Like you're at Disneyland with your kid, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1292.96s)]
*  and you got strawberry ice cream with your kid. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1294.6s)]
*  And then you went to Universal Studios with your kid. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1296.6s)]
*  Some creep pedophile goes up to the kid. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  He goes, oh, hey, Johnny, right? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1301.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm Mark. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1303.9599999999998s)]
*  I met you at Disneyland. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1305.32s)]
*  Remember, we got the strawberry ice cream? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1306.4399999999998s)]
*  And then we went to Universal Studios. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1308.36s)]
*  Your dad told me to come pick you up. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1310.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1311.48s)]
*  So that's how they just collect information. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1312.12s)]
*  And then it's probably easy to talk a kid with all those details [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1314.28s)]
*  into getting into a car. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1319.9199999999998s)]
*  I saw it hit and run last night. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1321.52s)]
*  Did I tell you about this? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1324.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, last night. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1325.0s)]
*  At the club? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1325.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1326.24s)]
*  The T-bone. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1326.76s)]
*  The guy was running from the cops. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1327.24s)]
*  Guy was high speed pursuit from the cops. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1328.48s)]
*  Two cars in front of us. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1331.52s)]
*  So. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1333.3200000000002s)]
*  I didn't realize you saw it in person. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1334.16s)]
*  I thought you saw it on live. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1335.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, holy shit. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1337.2s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1338.16s)]
*  I saw the whole thing. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1339.04s)]
*  So I didn't know that he was running from the cops. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1340.4s)]
*  I just see this car flying at the intersection [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1342.76s)]
*  and T-bone this other car. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  He's trying to make it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1348.48s)]
*  He tries to hit the turn. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1349.48s)]
*  Boom. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1350.68s)]
*  I mean, fast. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  And then opens the door and runs. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1353.4s)]
*  So the dude who T-bone the guy jumps out of his car [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1357.24s)]
*  at a full sprint, full sprint across the street. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  And me and the guy I was with were like, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1365.0s)]
*  he's probably drunk. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1368.92s)]
*  He's probably realized he fucked up and he's drunk [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1370.4s)]
*  and he's trying to run away from the scene of the crime. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1373.44s)]
*  And then they tackle him. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  Some citizens got him. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1378.92s)]
*  And so we hear, they got him. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1380.8000000000002s)]
*  We got him. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1382.3600000000001s)]
*  We got him. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't want Texas citizens getting me. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1383.2s)]
*  They're more armed than most police officers here, dude. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1384.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, not only that, it's the lake. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1387.2s)]
*  So everybody's running around out there. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1388.52s)]
*  It's like it's fit because it's right over by Lady Bird Lake. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1390.24s)]
*  So this guy apparently was in a high speed chase [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1394.0800000000002s)]
*  from the police and just slammed right into a car. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1397.04s)]
*  I mean, easily could have been us. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1399.16s)]
*  It was two cars in front of us. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1400.4s)]
*  That's fucking wild. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1401.64s)]
*  But it was boom. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1402.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen in person someone hit a guy [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1404.96s)]
*  with a car that hard, like up close. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1409.1200000000001s)]
*  And it went into the passenger side? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1411.64s)]
*  Oh, just smooshed the side of this car. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  This car went flying. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1416.08s)]
*  The one car, it goes flying up in the air. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1418.48s)]
*  And the other car goes flying to the side. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1422.0s)]
*  And then boom, the car falls down. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1424.28s)]
*  And the moment it falls down, the dude opens the door. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1425.84s)]
*  He's out. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1428.0s)]
*  He's running. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1428.5s)]
*  And he was dressed like he just got done playing golf. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  It was so weird to see. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1434.32s)]
*  He's wearing a golf shirt. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1435.32s)]
*  I love that his first instinct was I'm just fucking out. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  Run. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1439.24s)]
*  What did he do wrong? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1439.68s)]
*  He just ran the light. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1440.56s)]
*  Warrant out for his arrest or something. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1441.36s)]
*  It was probably something. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1444.0s)]
*  Because if he's run from the cops, something was going on. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1445.24s)]
*  When you see that shit reel up close, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1447.6799999999998s)]
*  it always blows my mind. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1450.08s)]
*  When I first moved to LA, I lived right above Ari [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  on Miller Drive above Pink Dot so that I could [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1455.28s)]
*  be close to the Comedy Store. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1458.0s)]
*  And there's that intersection there. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1459.76s)]
*  It's Sunset in La Cienega. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1461.1599999999999s)]
*  And there's all these. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1462.52s)]
*  And both people trying to take lefts [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  are always trying to shoot the yellow light. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1465.9399999999998s)]
*  And I'm at the northern part of the intersection. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1469.04s)]
*  And a motorcycle is coming down Sunset, fast as shit. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1471.92s)]
*  And then someone's trying to take the left. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1474.92s)]
*  When I tell you, I've been in LA five days. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1477.32s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to be a comedian. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1479.68s)]
*  I'm in front of Pink Dot. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1481.0s)]
*  I see this car hit the motorcycle. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1482.32s)]
*  The guy goes up into the air. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1484.68s)]
*  I mean, must have been 50 feet in the air. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1487.56s)]
*  His shoes come off. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1489.52s)]
*  I guess that's the thing when you get hit by a car. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1490.56s)]
*  Your shoes come off, which is wild. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1492.8s)]
*  And then comes down head first. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1494.32s)]
*  Because your head is the heaviest. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1496.52s)]
*  And I mean, it was so disturbing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1498.22s)]
*  Head broke off his body. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1501.3s)]
*  I mean, just head off body. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1502.54s)]
*  And then shoes were like 50 feet away from him. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1504.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1507.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1508.6200000000001s)]
*  Very dead. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1509.5s)]
*  The deadest. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1511.3s)]
*  When you see that, you're like, I [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1512.94s)]
*  feel like that's how it would have gone in a Michael Bay [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1514.3600000000001s)]
*  movie. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1515.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1516.42s)]
*  That just feels a little wild when you actually [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1516.9s)]
*  see it up close. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1519.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1520.54s)]
*  The sounds, the crunching, the thuds. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1521.66s)]
*  You're like, oh, that's just a body. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1524.06s)]
*  The thing is, it's kind of extraordinary. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1525.42s)]
*  How little car accidents we have. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1527.98s)]
*  When you think about how many people are just so distracted [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1531.5s)]
*  and how crazy the act of getting onto this concrete surface [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1535.1s)]
*  with this thing that's rolling around with a combustion [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1540.38s)]
*  engine. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1543.34s)]
*  And you're just letting normal people drive them around. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1544.3s)]
*  It's kind of a miracle how cooperative we all are. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1547.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1548.78s)]
*  It is kind of weird. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1549.3s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1550.22s)]
*  But the stakes are so high. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1551.14s)]
*  I mean, in terms of having to pay for it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1552.38s)]
*  I got in enough car accidents in my 20s [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1554.5s)]
*  that I was like, I don't have that kind of money. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1556.5s)]
*  It's too much of a hassle. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1558.58s)]
*  Well, it's just sketchy. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1560.66s)]
*  You're relying on other people. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1561.66s)]
*  And every now and then, there's one guy [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1563.1s)]
*  that's got to get there on time. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1564.62s)]
*  He's fucking cut in front of everybody. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1565.94s)]
*  And you watch, and you're like, oh, look [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1567.7s)]
*  at this guy in the pickup truck. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1569.2s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1570.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1571.22s)]
*  I was thinking because you can see so much carnage online now. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1571.78s)]
*  In my algorithm, I guess, I don't know. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1575.94s)]
*  Enough comedians sent me videos of people getting murdered. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1577.86s)]
*  My algorithm is terrible. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1580.94s)]
*  It's just like butts and car accidents [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1582.58s)]
*  and how the Disney castles are made of dicks. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1586.46s)]
*  Like that's basically it. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1588.8999999999999s)]
*  Is that from Tripoli? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1591.9399999999998s)]
*  Did you know that Tripoli has 12 podcasts? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1594.82s)]
*  Yeah, at least. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1597.3s)]
*  I'm going to give birth. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1598.74s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1603.4199999999998s)]
*  And so, yeah, so Tripoli sends me all this stuff. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1604.4199999999998s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, the Disney castles being made of dicks. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1606.54s)]
*  It is a compelling case. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1609.82s)]
*  But I think it was probably more that they didn't pay [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1611.26s)]
*  their animators. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1612.8600000000001s)]
*  And the animators were like, fuck you guys. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1613.66s)]
*  We're just going to make the, you know. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1615.04s)]
*  I'm not totally aware of that one. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  I think I don't remember it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1618.14s)]
*  Let's pull that one up. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1619.74s)]
*  Disney castles made of dicks. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1621.02s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1621.66s)]
*  About to get it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1622.46s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of wild stuff from the old Disney stuff. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1622.94s)]
*  You go back in the old, old Disney. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1626.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1628.1000000000001s)]
*  You're like, you guys should probably bury this. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1628.58s)]
*  Brutal. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1631.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1631.78s)]
*  You might want to take the obviously Jewish person's [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1632.3s)]
*  nose down a little bit. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1634.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1636.02s)]
*  In this one. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1636.5s)]
*  There was one where there was a big bad wolf one. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1637.42s)]
*  And it used to be a Jewish person. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1643.66s)]
*  And then they switched it to a wolf later. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1646.26s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1648.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1649.18s)]
*  And it's cheap. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1649.68s)]
*  It won't pay the price for the baguette [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1650.26s)]
*  for the Little Red Riding Hood. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1653.14s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1654.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it's the Little Mermaid, the Spears [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1655.8600000000001s)]
*  looking like dicks. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1660.02s)]
*  I think they probably just didn't pay their animators. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1661.5800000000002s)]
*  And the animators were like, all right. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1663.7s)]
*  We're just going to make everything look like a dick. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1664.7s)]
*  Some people do see dicks in everything, though. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1666.22s)]
*  There's that. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1668.5s)]
*  It is kind of a more shock test. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1669.38s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1670.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1671.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'm one of those people. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1673.66s)]
*  Then there's also Mickey and Minnie. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1675.74s)]
*  Like, one of her bows does kind of look like a dick going [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1677.58s)]
*  right for her mouth. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1680.94s)]
*  It feels like a disgruntled employee. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1682.54s)]
*  What? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1685.42s)]
*  The video you posted got taken down. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1685.94s)]
*  I was just going to play that one. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1687.7s)]
*  Oh, I posted? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1688.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1689.78s)]
*  It's been removed. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1690.26s)]
*  Which one was that one? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1691.22s)]
*  Everything I post. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1692.22s)]
*  About this on this topic. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1692.78s)]
*  On the dicks? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1693.78s)]
*  She has a video that I was just going to use that [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1694.26s)]
*  as the example, but it's been taken down. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1695.98s)]
*  They take all my stuff down now. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1697.3s)]
*  I also hear some interesting stuff I just found, though. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1698.78s)]
*  Marshmallow cannon? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1701.5s)]
*  What? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1703.06s)]
*  But hold on. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1704.14s)]
*  I mean, it'll play. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1705.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1706.18s)]
*  It should show. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1706.7s)]
*  No. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1707.58s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1710.5s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1713.22s)]
*  That's 100% a dick squirting marshmallows. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1714.1s)]
*  On a little mouse. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1718.06s)]
*  It just jizzed all over this mouse. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1720.3s)]
*  It's that. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1721.6200000000001s)]
*  It's like. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1722.3s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1723.18s)]
*  That's a dick. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1724.82s)]
*  That's 100% a dick. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1726.58s)]
*  Look at the balls at the bottom of it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1728.78s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1730.34s)]
*  That's not a coincidence. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1730.8999999999999s)]
*  I didn't even notice the balls. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1731.86s)]
*  That is not a coincidence. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1733.3s)]
*  That's 100% a dick. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1735.02s)]
*  Look up the minion Mickey Mouse. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1736.4199999999998s)]
*  That one is the one that really kind of put me over the edge. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1738.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's someone being sneaky and putting [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1741.54s)]
*  in like a little Easter egg. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1743.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1744.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't get paid over time. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1745.26s)]
*  That's a dick. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1746.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1748.1399999999999s)]
*  And now the Disney employees are trying, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1748.5s)]
*  or the animators are trying to unionize. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1749.8999999999999s)]
*  I'd be shocked if they succeed. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1751.54s)]
*  They're probably just going to have AI do it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1752.86s)]
*  You could also just go to images. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1754.54s)]
*  The thing is, AI is so good now. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1755.86s)]
*  Like, these animators are on shaky ground. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1758.02s)]
*  Yes, correct. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1760.54s)]
*  What happened with the actor strike? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1762.58s)]
*  Did they settle that? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1764.1s)]
*  Is that over? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1764.98s)]
*  Yeah, they settled it. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1765.5s)]
*  Oh, do Minnie and Mickey Dicks. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1767.3s)]
*  Minnie and Mickey Dicks. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1770.7s)]
*  Dicks. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1771.78s)]
*  Oh, it's right there. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1772.34s)]
*  Go to the one, two, three, four, like six over on the top. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1773.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1775.6599999999999s)]
*  One more over, sorry. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1776.22s)]
*  That one, yeah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1777.3s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1779.34s)]
*  That's her dress. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1781.06s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1782.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1783.46s)]
*  OK. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1784.7s)]
*  It's a little wild. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1785.34s)]
*  Come on. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1786.18s)]
*  I mean, maybe. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1788.46s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1789.54s)]
*  And he's got his hand on her dick. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1790.34s)]
*  She's got a giant heart on. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1793.1s)]
*  That is 100% a heart on. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1794.5s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense as a dress. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1796.46s)]
*  Just going straight into his mouth. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1798.18s)]
*  Just try to imagine that as a dress. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1799.5s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1801.3s)]
*  Yeah, like, where's her arm? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1802.18s)]
*  Oh, it's around his neck. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1803.18s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1804.62s)]
*  Where her arm? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1805.3799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1805.82s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1806.74s)]
*  Where's her right arm? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1808.22s)]
*  It's a hard one to defend. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1809.26s)]
*  Oh, they're both around there. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1809.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1811.14s)]
*  She's hugging him. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1811.5s)]
*  And that's her shoulder, supposedly. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1812.46s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1814.3400000000001s)]
*  Like a pussy dress. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1814.82s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  There's her knee. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1816.3s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1817.46s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1818.14s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1818.7s)]
*  That's a dick. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1819.98s)]
*  It's way more of a dick than it is her arm around his shoulder. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1821.5s)]
*  You know, if it's one of two things, that looks so much like it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1826.1000000000001s)]
*  And his hand's on it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1828.66s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1829.66s)]
*  He's stroking it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1830.18s)]
*  And also, the little lines. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1830.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1832.58s)]
*  Does she always have a puffy shoulder shirt on like that? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1833.58s)]
*  Is that consistent? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1836.02s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1837.26s)]
*  And then it's also like the little ridge on the top. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1839.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1842.8600000000001s)]
*  Doesn't feel necessary. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1843.3400000000001s)]
*  It's a dick. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1844.22s)]
*  That's definitely a dick. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1845.74s)]
*  That's a shadow. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1846.98s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1847.98s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1848.98s)]
*  That's 100% a dick. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1849.46s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1850.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1851.42s)]
*  I'm going to get a dart in my neck any minute. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  Disney's going to get us. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1854.18s)]
*  They're already in trouble. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1855.26s)]
*  They fucked up. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1856.6200000000001s)]
*  They went too far. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1857.3400000000001s)]
*  You were telling us about the South Park thing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1858.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, my god, dude. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1860.46s)]
*  Jamie, have you seen the new South Park? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1861.26s)]
*  I definitely saw clips of it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1863.1000000000001s)]
*  It was so funny. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1864.22s)]
*  First of all, Cartman has been replaced [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1866.38s)]
*  by a black trans woman in the ulterior universe [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1868.54s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1875.46s)]
*  And the whole thing, really incisive commentary, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1876.18s)]
*  obviously. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1878.8999999999999s)]
*  They always do such a good job with this. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1879.34s)]
*  It's the Pandaverse, which is hilarious. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1881.3799999999999s)]
*  It's such a great name. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1884.1399999999999s)]
*  All the handymen are the richest people [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1885.3s)]
*  because no men know how to do anything anymore [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1888.94s)]
*  because they went to college. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1891.58s)]
*  So it's all about how college has made us stupid. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1893.74s)]
*  And we need handymen to do everything now [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1896.3799999999999s)]
*  because we're using Siri and whatever. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1898.18s)]
*  So there's the handyman bought Instagram [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1899.8600000000001s)]
*  and now is going to space because he's just a billionaire. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1902.66s)]
*  And then Cartman is a Catherine Kennedy who runs Disney [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1905.5800000000002s)]
*  but ran Lucasfilm and whatever. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1911.14s)]
*  And her whole thing is just make it a girl and make her gay. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1912.8200000000002s)]
*  Make it a girl and make her gay. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1915.66s)]
*  For every movie they're pitching. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1919.0600000000002s)]
*  She gets served food at a restaurant. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1921.7s)]
*  And she's like, I told you to make it a girl and make it gay. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1923.94s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1927.34s)]
*  It's so well done. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1928.58s)]
*  Yeah, how did the people that are that goofy [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1930.1399999999999s)]
*  get in control of media like that? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1934.5s)]
*  I think that there's a really, I think [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1936.9399999999998s)]
*  we're going to look back at this time and go, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1939.22s)]
*  remember when we thought 300 comments on Twitter [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1940.98s)]
*  represented everyone? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1944.8999999999999s)]
*  Remember when we had that confirmation [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1947.9399999999998s)]
*  but we got scared of a bunch of tweets, half of which [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1950.86s)]
*  might just be bots or truly crazy people? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1953.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1956.26s)]
*  I don't know what the statistic is now. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1957.62s)]
*  Also people crazy enough to be commenting on things all day. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1959.34s)]
*  Yeah, good or bad. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1961.86s)]
*  The people that I know that are on Twitter all day commenting [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1962.86s)]
*  on stuff, they're mentally ill. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1965.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1966.4599999999998s)]
*  The ones I know are mentally ill. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1967.34s)]
*  I know they're all fucked up. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1969.34s)]
*  I know they're medicated to shit. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1970.5s)]
*  And then they're on there freaking themselves out arguing [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1972.3s)]
*  with people all day. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1974.6599999999999s)]
*  I think not only are they medicated on whatever they're [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1975.62s)]
*  on, but also I think Twitter is a drug. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1977.86s)]
*  I mean, you get that hit of self-righteous indignation. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1980.2199999999998s)]
*  It's like the people who write in [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1983.1399999999999s)]
*  to complain about their Mr. Goodbar being wrapped weird. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1984.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1988.06s)]
*  And for actors and people in show business, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1988.86s)]
*  it's almost like you're testing yourself out, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1990.8999999999999s)]
*  like writing scripts for yourself [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1993.54s)]
*  to be like a hero in this scene. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1996.82s)]
*  And I think a lot of people need to be heard. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=1999.7399999999998s)]
*  Totally get that. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2001.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's real too. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2003.02s)]
*  That's real too. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2004.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's a real application [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2005.3799999999999s)]
*  for it in terms of your ability to communicate about things [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2007.3s)]
*  and learn more about other people's perspectives [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2010.5s)]
*  if you can cultivate a good group of humans. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2012.66s)]
*  But if you're famous, that's not tenable. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  There's too many people. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2019.5400000000002s)]
*  If you're dealing with a product like a Disney film, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2020.7s)]
*  there's just too many people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2024.22s)]
*  There's too many people. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2025.42s)]
*  You're never going to be. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2026.14s)]
*  And you're just going to encounter what you encounter. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2027.3400000000001s)]
*  It's random. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2029.46s)]
*  It's not like you're getting the ones from, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2031.22s)]
*  like I went to Stanford and asked the psychologists [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2034.3000000000002s)]
*  what their opinion on it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2037.9s)]
*  No, no, no, you're just getting fucking, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2038.8200000000002s)]
*  you're getting the wildest of wild opinions [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2040.54s)]
*  from who knows how many different groups of people. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2043.3s)]
*  And you just, whatever you scroll into, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2046.3s)]
*  that's what you read. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2048.22s)]
*  Do you think there'll be a day where we look back [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2049.46s)]
*  and we go like, remember when you could just [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2051.18s)]
*  be on Twitter all day? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2053.1s)]
*  Is it going to be the way we are with cigarettes now? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2055.54s)]
*  Remember, you used to be able to smoke inside. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2058.74s)]
*  No, because people are just going to keep doing it. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2060.58s)]
*  Because it doesn't physically feel bad, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2062.82s)]
*  even though it is bad. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2065.3s)]
*  We're really bad at things that don't burn our fingers. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2066.66s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2071.58s)]
*  We're really bad at just continuing [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2072.54s)]
*  to do certain things, like a Twitter type deal, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2075.2599999999998s)]
*  or just any kind of online social interaction [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2078.8599999999997s)]
*  is so different than regular human interaction [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2083.2999999999997s)]
*  that if you get used to doing it all the time, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2085.98s)]
*  it kind of reprograms the way you communicate with people, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2087.8599999999997s)]
*  period. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2091.66s)]
*  Just like the new normal. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2092.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you see people spill over, like Twitter Talks spill [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2093.42s)]
*  over in real life with horrible consequences. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2096.6600000000003s)]
*  It's like my favorite Mike Tyson quote, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2099.42s)]
*  is the problem with people today is you can talk shit [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2101.1800000000003s)]
*  and not get punched in the face. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2103.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2105.06s)]
*  And then you see him talk shit in person, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2105.58s)]
*  it doesn't go so well. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2106.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's real. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2108.1s)]
*  I mean, you're supposed to have consequences for your behavior. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2109.62s)]
*  Like a bunch of my friends that are parents [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2112.9s)]
*  say that bullies will come in and they'll say the craziest [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2114.38s)]
*  shit just because they've been on Twitter or online [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2117.1400000000003s)]
*  or on those video games where you're allowed to talk shit, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2119.5s)]
*  and then you go into the real world [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2121.7000000000003s)]
*  and it's a little different. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2122.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's plenty of those videos on my Instagram [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2124.06s)]
*  too, people getting fucked up. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2126.3s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about this because I was like, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2127.9s)]
*  is it new that we are able to see horrific shit just like- [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2130.38s)]
*  Constantly. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2134.3s)]
*  Constantly. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2134.98s)]
*  But I was thinking like, what are the other collective visual [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2135.98s)]
*  traumas we've had that we've seen? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2139.42s)]
*  And I kind of missed this a little bit, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2141.0600000000004s)]
*  but I remember hearing about it because I had an older brother. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2143.7400000000002s)]
*  Remember the Challenger explosion? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2146.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2148.38s)]
*  It makes me, I've been trying to write a joke about it, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2149.7400000000002s)]
*  they rolled in TVs into classrooms to watch this [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2151.9s)]
*  with the teacher. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2157.14s)]
*  Remember there was like a teacher on it? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2157.78s)]
*  And they showed it and everybody just watched this teacher [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2159.82s)]
*  explode in the sky. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2162.94s)]
*  I remember not knowing exactly what was going on at first. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2164.1s)]
*  Going, what's happening? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2167.5s)]
*  Like, why is there like so many different, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2169.78s)]
*  like there was like one going this way and one going that way. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2171.54s)]
*  And then they started talking about it, oh no. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2174.5s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2177.78s)]
*  And then you realize like, oh shit, did that thing blow up? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2178.58s)]
*  Because do you remember watching it at first? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2182.3s)]
*  Like it didn't, I didn't know exactly what was happening. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2184.06s)]
*  I watched it recently and kind of was like, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2186.38s)]
*  oh, I remember watching it like on the news [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2188.3s)]
*  when I was really young and not understanding [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2189.9s)]
*  what was going on. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2191.7s)]
*  Can you pull up the Challenger explosion? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2192.46s)]
*  By the way, that all could apparently [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2194.58s)]
*  could have been mitigated. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2196.1s)]
*  People knew that there was problems with the O-rings. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2197.18s)]
*  And really? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2199.82s)]
*  You got to think how many fucking people are involved [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2201.58s)]
*  in those things and how bad the government is [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2204.62s)]
*  almost everything. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2207.2999999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2208.54s)]
*  Almost everything. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  They looked for the teacher. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2210.62s)]
*  It was like this whole thing. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2211.8199999999997s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2214.8999999999996s)]

*  He's just dead. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2249.14s)]
*  What a weird thing we try to do. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2250.2599999999998s)]
*  Fill giant tubes up with combustible liquid [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2252.7799999999997s)]
*  and then light an explosion and shoot them up [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2257.14s)]
*  into the fucking sky to get out of Earth's gravity. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2260.06s)]
*  Well, it's definitely, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2264.5s)]
*  definitely has worked a gang of times. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2265.7s)]
*  I know, but it's just like. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2267.42s)]
*  Look at the amount of power you're dealing with. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2270.22s)]
*  That's what's so bonkers. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2272.7799999999997s)]
*  The amount of thrust that you need to escape our atmosphere [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2275.06s)]
*  and escape our gravity. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2278.58s)]
*  It's just so nuts. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2279.7799999999997s)]
*  And then how? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2281.2999999999997s)]

*  You gotta go look at a bunch of trash [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2313.38s)]
*  at the bottom of the ocean. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2314.82s)]

*  There's been 50,000 lawsuits. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2606.3799999999997s)]
*  They've paid, I think, over eight or nine billion, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2609.02s)]
*  which is probably nothing to them, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2610.94s)]
*  but women getting ovarian cancer from the asbestos in it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2612.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2616.42s)]
*  And then also the miners of the talc. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2617.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2619.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was reading, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2620.3s)]
*  that talc and asbestos are often in the same spot [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2621.78s)]
*  and they don't filter it out well. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2625.38s)]
*  To what? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2627.66s)]
*  Like, they don't even test [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2628.5s)]
*  to see if the talc has asbestos in it sometimes. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2629.34s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson's gotten away with some wild shit. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2631.9s)]
*  Well, that's a wild one. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2634.42s)]
*  I just, did they know? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2635.58s)]
*  We were putting it on babies. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2638.02s)]
*  What I wanna know is, did they know? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2639.26s)]
*  Did they know that sometimes their talc has asbestos in it? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2641.14s)]
*  It was just too problematic to sift it out [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2644.2200000000003s)]
*  and figure out what's what? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2647.14s)]
*  What is the deal with that? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2649.2200000000003s)]
*  Find out what's the deal with talc and asbestos. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2650.18s)]
*  I think the miners definitely complained. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2651.86s)]
*  My guess is it is a similar trajectory to the... [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2653.42s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2656.14s)]
*  Because talc and asbestos are minerals found close together. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2657.02s)]
*  When talc is mined, it may contain traces of asbestos. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2659.82s)]
*  Talcum powder's still an ingredient [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2663.46s)]
*  in a number of cosmetic brands. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2664.78s)]
*  As recently as November of 2020, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2666.22s)]
*  a study found that 14% of the talc-containing makeup [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2668.2599999999998s)]
*  tested contained asbestos. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2672.06s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2674.8599999999997s)]
*  Can I tell you, a lot of my girlfriends, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2677.14s)]
*  when they act insane, I ask a couple questions. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2679.18s)]
*  I'm like, what birth control are you on? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2682.3799999999997s)]
*  And what hair products and makeup are you using? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2684.22s)]
*  Because you're just putting chemicals in. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2686.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, your skin's your biggest organ, right? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2688.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2690.5s)]
*  And you're just, that amount of chemicals [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2691.3399999999997s)]
*  women just put on their bodies, in their bodies. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2692.3799999999997s)]
*  They knew for decades that asbestos [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2695.42s)]
*  lurked in its baby powder. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2697.5s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2698.62s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2699.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2700.86s)]
*  This is Reuters. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2702.82s)]
*  I want to say it was in St. Louis, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2703.86s)]
*  but it was over 50,000 lawsuits. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2705.26s)]
*  Oh my god, that's so crazy. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2708.06s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson didn't tell the FDA [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2710.62s)]
*  that at least three tests by three different labs. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2712.02s)]
*  From 72 to 75, it found asbestos in its talc, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2714.02s)]
*  in one case that levels reported as rather high. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2717.9s)]
*  Who says rather? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2720.98s)]
*  Who says rather in that context? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2723.14s)]
*  What kind of numbers are we talking about? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2726.54s)]
*  They were rather high. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2728.8199999999997s)]
*  Also, and then as soon as the Johnson & Johnson [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2730.7799999999997s)]
*  vaccine came out, we just flocked. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2733.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a trusted name. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2735.7s)]
*  Well, that was the first one they pulled. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2737.2999999999997s)]
*  I did it. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2738.8199999999997s)]
*  Did you do that one? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2740.02s)]
*  Yeah, who knows what's even in my belly. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2740.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm kind of worried. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2743.06s)]
*  Let's think on the positive side. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2743.9s)]
*  How come in comic books, whenever someone gets exposure [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2745.2599999999998s)]
*  to radiation, they get superpowers? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2751.54s)]
*  I got pregnant at 40. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2752.54s)]
*  This is a vaccine injury, 100%. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2754.02s)]
*  Isn't it supposed to be the opposite though? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2757.5s)]
*  It's supposed to stop women from? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2759.14s)]
*  Yeah, I guess women were having a lot of fertility problems. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2760.34s)]
*  And pregnant women that took it, their placentas [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2763.34s)]
*  were hardening. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2765.42s)]
*  There was a lot of sketchy stuff happening. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2766.18s)]
*  Fertility is going down in a way that's super alarming. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2770.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you think people will be more skeptical [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2773.7799999999997s)]
*  of novel medical interventions in the future? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2776.66s)]
*  If something like this comes up in the future, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2781.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think people will be as quick to line up. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2783.06s)]
*  I think fear does wild stuff to people. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2785.62s)]
*  Yeah, but we've never had that much of a reason [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2788.5s)]
*  to distrust the medical establishment, as we do now. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2791.22s)]
*  Just like the videos that you could watch of them saying, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2794.7799999999997s)]
*  it's 100% effective, it's 80% effective, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2797.22s)]
*  it's effective against preventing [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2799.94s)]
*  severe hospitalization or death. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2802.62s)]
*  I think that, at least the people that I know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2805.7799999999997s)]
*  are very suspicious of stuff like that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2807.9s)]
*  The thing that really freaks me out [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2811.14s)]
*  is even natural remedies are starting to be bought up [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2812.4599999999996s)]
*  by these corporations. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2814.62s)]
*  So, you know Bragg's apple cider vinegar? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2815.58s)]
*  Bill Gates bought it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2818.62s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2819.74s)]
*  Bill Gates now owns one of the few natural, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2820.58s)]
*  healthy tonics we had, and he's putting the apples in it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2824.7s)]
*  Oh, the appeal? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  The appeal, the creepy ass. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2828.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, what is that? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2830.7s)]
*  That's like a coating that they spray [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2832.4199999999996s)]
*  on the outside of vegetables? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2834.22s)]
*  It's like some Shmegma to keep the apples preserved longer. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2835.8999999999996s)]
*  Is it just apples? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2839.62s)]
*  Is he just so obsessed that he didn't invent Apple computers [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2841.02s)]
*  that he's just like, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2844.1s)]
*  Just poisoning everything apples? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2845.02s)]
*  He just has to. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2846.66s)]
*  But yeah, it's like for Costco apples [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2848.02s)]
*  to stay fresher longer. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2850.02s)]
*  But what is in it? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2851.66s)]
*  I would love to know. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2852.7799999999997s)]
*  I would love to know. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2854.46s)]
*  These motherfuckers, they get stuff out there [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2855.2999999999997s)]
*  before anybody's aware that these things are a problem, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2858.1s)]
*  and then years later, you're like, what's in it? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2860.7799999999997s)]
*  Talc asbestos. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2862.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2864.02s)]
*  And then you don't find out till later. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2864.8599999999997s)]
*  So it's like talking about this and just being suspicious [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2865.7s)]
*  about like, should apples last for four weeks? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2868.54s)]
*  I feel like Bill needs a hug. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2870.42s)]
*  Like, why are you working so hard? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2872.02s)]
*  Did you see the video of him against trees? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2873.38s)]
*  What? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2877.2200000000003s)]
*  Bill Gates, look at Bill Gates against trees. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2878.06s)]
*  Oh, he thinks he should bury all the trees? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2879.78s)]
*  He's like, I don't plant trees. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2882.34s)]
*  Like he doesn't believe in trees. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2883.94s)]
*  Someone needs to blow this guy. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2886.94s)]
*  I volunteer as tribute. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2888.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll jump on this grenade. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2889.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what, I mean, between, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2891.02s)]
*  and then I guess he owns half of the McDonald's potatoes [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2892.82s)]
*  for the french fries. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2896.6600000000003s)]
*  Bill Gates gets real about climate change. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2899.02s)]
*  Planting trees is complete nonsense, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2901.1400000000003s)]
*  but the end of the oil and gas era is finally in sight. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2904.06s)]
*  Planting trees is complete nonsense. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2908.42s)]
*  We don't think planting trees is good. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2911.9s)]
*  Aren't planting trees, don't they make oxygen? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2913.6600000000003s)]
*  How would it be nonsense to have something [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2915.78s)]
*  that filters carbon dioxide and makes oxygen? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2917.54s)]
*  I think he's done too much of that appeal. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2919.62s)]
*  Blame circling that Microsoft founder Bill Gates [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2921.94s)]
*  supports chopping down 70 million acres of trees, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2923.78s)]
*  but the truth is more complicated. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2927.74s)]
*  Oh. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2929.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2930.66s)]
*  What's complicated? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2931.4799999999996s)]
*  Shock. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2932.4599999999996s)]
*  There's a video of him being very glib about it. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2933.8999999999996s)]
*  Promoting deforestation, okay. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2938.2999999999997s)]
*  Cool cause. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2941.2999999999997s)]
*  Well I think he kinda wants to regulate the weather, right? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2942.8199999999997s)]
*  The startup company has a unique concept [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2944.74s)]
*  for the removal of trees to protect California forests. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2946.62s)]
*  Well there's something to the removal of dead trees, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2950.3399999999997s)]
*  and that's something that actually Trump talked about [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2953.18s)]
*  when the wildfires were hitting California. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2955.3799999999997s)]
*  He said he was gonna cut off their funding [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2957.2999999999997s)]
*  if they didn't take care of their forests. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2958.42s)]
*  But I don't think that's what he's saying. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2960.46s)]
*  No, I don't think that's what he's saying either. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2961.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't think he's saying like. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2962.66s)]
*  What you're supposed to do is trees die, right? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2964.8199999999997s)]
*  And they die and then they fall and you get dead fall [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2967.54s)]
*  and that stuff dries out [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2970.42s)]
*  and that stuff becomes highly flammable. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2971.98s)]
*  So if you got a gang, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2974.14s)]
*  like there was an issue back a few years ago. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2975.1s)]
*  There was a thing called the bark beetle. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2978.94s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2980.62s)]
*  It was up in like, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2982.46s)]
*  what's that lake, Big Bear? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2985.68s)]
*  It's like up in that area. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2987.8399999999997s)]
*  It's where all my friends go to relapse. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2989.2799999999997s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2990.9599999999996s)]
*  No one goes to Big Bear and comes back sober. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2993.08s)]
*  Big Bear is a crazy place. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2995.12s)]
*  It is. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2996.24s)]
*  So this beetle was consuming the bark of these trees [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=2997.08s)]
*  and killing these trees. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3001.16s)]
*  So you had like, you know, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3002.0s)]
*  who knows how many thousands and thousands of dead trees [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3003.52s)]
*  that were essentially kindling. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3006.74s)]
*  And so when a wildfire happened, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3008.48s)]
*  it just burned right through everything. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3011.0s)]
*  Nobody had ever removed the dead trees. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3013.44s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta do that. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3015.44s)]
*  And that's the thing about a lot of these forests [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  is that if you got a lot of, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3019.52s)]
*  but it's also like the amount of resources [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3020.8s)]
*  involved in removing all those dead trees. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3022.84s)]
*  Who knows how many acres? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3025.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3027.32s)]
*  I mean, I live in wildfire land, as you know, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3028.2000000000003s)]
*  in Topanga in California. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3030.6400000000003s)]
*  And I do like voluntary equine evacuation with LAFD [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3031.7200000000003s)]
*  and they would fight from my house [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3035.84s)]
*  because I'm kind of right at sort of the end [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3037.6400000000003s)]
*  of like 170 acres, like in a hollow kind of thing. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3039.72s)]
*  So they would just come in and fight. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3043.64s)]
*  So they come over sometimes. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3044.94s)]
*  And I was talking to one of these firefighters about like, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3046.44s)]
*  you know, like, oh, the forest fires. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3048.92s)]
*  And he was like, look, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3050.54s)]
*  that's gonna get me in some trouble maybe. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3051.7599999999998s)]
*  But he's like, look, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3052.84s)]
*  most of the fires in California are homeless people, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3053.84s)]
*  but we can't tell people that [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3057.04s)]
*  or else people would just start taking baseball bats [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3058.2799999999997s)]
*  to homeless people constantly, you know? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3060.24s)]
*  So it's like, a lot of it is like fires or smoking [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3061.96s)]
*  or little campfires. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3064.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3066.7999999999997s)]
*  Campfires. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3067.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3068.88s)]
*  Well, if your life is so fucked up [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3069.84s)]
*  that you're, you know, in a fucking tent [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3072.3s)]
*  on the middle of a grassy hillside [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3075.36s)]
*  and you're doing fentanyl, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3077.7200000000003s)]
*  you're probably not so responsible with fire. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3079.04s)]
*  The homeless camp wars in Venice [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3081.2000000000003s)]
*  where they were just throwing like Molotov cocktails [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3083.44s)]
*  at each other to set each other on fire. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3085.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was the Gaza strip there for a minute. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3087.6s)]
*  It's just so nuts that it happened so quick. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3091.28s)]
*  Again, Russia, good job. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3094.48s)]
*  You guys nailed it. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3096.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3097.76s)]
*  You did, to our education system, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3099.16s)]
*  whatever you did to crush our faith in democracy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3100.68s)]
*  What else? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3104.64s)]
*  Amazing work. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3105.48s)]
*  Yeah, and just a testament to how like [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3106.2999999999997s)]
*  one sick bill will put you out. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3108.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, and people can't afford housing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3110.4s)]
*  There's that, but it's mostly mental illness [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3112.2s)]
*  and drug addiction. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3114.48s)]
*  It's mostly that. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  There's people that are down on their luck, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3117.36s)]
*  but those people usually find a way back. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3119.02s)]
*  It's mental illness for the most part and drug addiction. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3121.62s)]
*  And, you know, and also the community [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3125.3199999999997s)]
*  that comes from a bunch of people [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3127.8s)]
*  that are also just as fucked up as you. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3129.04s)]
*  People like to be around, if you're a fucking mess, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3132.1600000000003s)]

*  He's out there getting up at 4.30 in the morning [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3138.5600000000004s)]
*  and working out and like, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3140.92s)]
*  you want to be a mess around other non-ambitious people [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3142.1600000000003s)]
*  that are just laying around. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3145.88s)]
*  And that's their community. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3147.52s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3148.6400000000003s)]
*  In California, you can be homeless. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3149.48s)]
*  I mean, the homeless people in California, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3151.02s)]
*  they're not trying, they've got ring lights, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  they've got cell phones. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3154.6800000000003s)]
*  They're getting their morning sunlight. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3157.16s)]
*  It's not that cold out. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3158.56s)]
*  It's not that big a deal. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3160.08s)]
*  They didn't get a 24 hour gym membership. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3161.0s)]
*  They're in shape too. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3163.6s)]
*  I had my, they look great. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3164.96s)]
*  It's that gym membership. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  They're barefoot, they're grounding in the grass. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3168.8399999999997s)]
*  They're probably healthier than most of us. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3170.72s)]
*  They're probably living the lives [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3171.7999999999997s)]
*  that we're all trying to learn to live from these, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3173.08s)]
*  you know, high performers. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3175.08s)]
*  But I got my laptop stolen out of my car outside, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3177.24s)]
*  the improv on Melrose. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3180.02s)]
*  And this guy, I wasn't going to fight with him about it, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3181.56s)]
*  but he was like, he was ripped. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3185.4s)]
*  He looked great. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3186.92s)]
*  He looked like Goggins. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3187.76s)]
*  I mean, he looked great, you know? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3188.6s)]
*  And it's just kind of a lifestyle at this point. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3189.92s)]
*  I don't think they're trying to change it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3192.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, also, if you steal anything that's less than $900, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3193.6s)]
*  they don't even arrest you. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3197.4s)]
*  That's right, with the stores and stuff. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3198.76s)]
*  What is this fucking dumbest shit ever? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3200.12s)]
*  And then these mass looting's where these kids organized? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3203.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  That's crazy too. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3207.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3207.9s)]
*  It's like, this is a complete collapse of society [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3208.7400000000002s)]
*  that's happening while we're here. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3212.34s)]
*  So it's hard to really understand the scope of it [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3215.92s)]
*  unless you could have a go back in time machine [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3218.88s)]
*  and see what those same streets looked like 20 years ago, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3221.92s)]
*  see what these same stores were like 20 years ago, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3225.88s)]
*  and then see what's going on now. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3228.36s)]
*  It's like, whoa, this is like a fucking Robocop movie. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3229.6s)]
*  Something's wrong here, real wrong. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3234.44s)]
*  Just gangs of people organizing to steal. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3236.7599999999998s)]
*  And then what do they do? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3240.16s)]
*  They put on eBay, they just are, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3241.0s)]
*  whatever you gotta do, man. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3243.2799999999997s)]
*  With what's going on in this country, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3245.44s)]
*  I'm always like, good for you guys. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3246.64s)]
*  Good for you to steal my laptop. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3248.6s)]
*  I don't mind that, I didn't mind that. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3250.08s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3252.08s)]
*  I had some good jokes in there. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3252.92s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3253.74s)]
*  One time Janine Garofalo was on stage [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3254.72s)]
*  and she goes, yeah, I lost my joke notebook in St. Louis. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3257.92s)]
*  So if you see anyone bombing around town, let me know. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3263.88s)]
*  There is something when you lose something [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3266.4s)]
*  that has jokes in it where you're like, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3269.66s)]
*  I just want that back because I don't want people [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  to see my jokes in progress, how embarrassing. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3272.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's true too. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3275.36s)]
*  Or they're just the notes. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3276.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3277.2s)]
*  It would be an evidence in a crime. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3278.04s)]
*  I'm definitely going to jail [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3282.2400000000002s)]
*  if anybody sees my joke notebook. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3283.44s)]
*  It would be like one of them physics papers though [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3285.28s)]
*  where you're like, I don't know what they're writing. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3287.88s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3289.2400000000002s)]
*  What is this? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3290.08s)]
*  This is a fucking arrow's pointing to dicks [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3290.92s)]
*  and this arrow pointing to clouds. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3293.2s)]
*  I have been kind of writing in a notebook recently jokes [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3295.76s)]
*  because you get on your computer [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3299.38s)]
*  and then you get a pop-up at, you wanna go out [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3301.0s)]
*  and you're like, I'll just research this [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3303.24s)]
*  and then you're in like a wormhole of Disney dicks [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3304.72s)]
*  for two hours, so I've started writing more [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3306.3599999999997s)]
*  and I've got this joke notebook and I'm like, God. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3308.72s)]
*  But I don't have my name on it or anything anymore. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3311.4399999999996s)]
*  You don't wanna lose it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3312.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's a portrait of insanity. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3313.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you take photos of each page? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3316.16s)]
*  I should do that. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3318.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3319.64s)]
*  That's really smart. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3320.4799999999996s)]
*  Then you can just open them up, spread them, you can read it. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3321.3999999999996s)]
*  Sometimes I'll do it like in my notes app, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3324.3599999999997s)]
*  like write jokes out and stuff. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3325.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's some applications [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  that will take written handwriting [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3329.4s)]
*  and convert it into text. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3332.48s)]
*  That's really smart. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3334.04s)]
*  I know that remarkable, that tablet thing does that. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3334.88s)]
*  It'll do that for you. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3339.1600000000003s)]
*  You ever seen that tablet? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3340.0s)]
*  No. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3340.84s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3341.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a tablet that it looks like a Kindle, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3342.5s)]
*  so it looks like white paper and you write on it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3346.04s)]
*  With like a pen. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3349.08s)]
*  With a pen. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3349.92s)]
*  Stylus. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3350.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then you get a, with a stylus. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3351.58s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3353.8s)]
*  But you have multiple pages. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3354.6400000000003s)]
*  So you write like that. Whoa. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3357.1200000000003s)]
*  And it looks like paper, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3358.16s)]
*  but then it'll convert it to text for you, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3359.44s)]
*  convert it to a type font. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3362.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3364.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3365.48s)]
*  But the thing is it's like, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3366.48s)]
*  you could have a thousand pages in that, easy. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3367.8s)]
*  You know, and you have a little- [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3370.56s)]
*  And can you erase easy with it? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3371.4s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's cool. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3373.12s)]
*  You could have little folders [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3373.96s)]
*  and all sorts of different things with it. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3375.2s)]
*  I'm kind of like, I don't know, I'm a little old school [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3377.56s)]
*  with like, I like having a piece of paper [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3379.2400000000002s)]
*  and tearing it out before I go on stage [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3380.6s)]
*  and put it in my pocket and have it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3382.32s)]
*  I don't know, there's just still a little attachment. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3383.88s)]
*  Well, they do say that there's something, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3386.0s)]
*  and I wonder if it would be the same on a tablet, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3387.44s)]
*  but they do say there's something, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3389.28s)]
*  when you physically write something down, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3391.16s)]
*  it's better for your memory. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3393.44s)]
*  Yep. Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  Part of writing it out is just remembering it. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3396.36s)]
*  Yeah. I think for me. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3398.16s)]
*  You know, and then I'll say it, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3399.64s)]
*  like I saw Jay-Z somewhere say, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3400.84s)]
*  if you say something 18 times in a row, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3402.4s)]
*  you'll remember it, whether that's true or not. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3405.04s)]
*  Like that's his process. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3406.88s)]
*  And then I kind of started doing that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3408.12s)]
*  Well, he famously doesn't write his raps down. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3409.4s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3412.04s)]
*  Yeah, he keeps it all in his head. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3412.88s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3414.88s)]
*  It's pretty wild, pretty genius. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3415.7000000000003s)]
*  But I know a lot of comics who do that. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3418.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3419.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of comics who don't write at all. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3420.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3421.8s)]
*  They could go on stage and do an hour and a half, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3422.64s)]
*  and it's all in their head. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3424.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3426.48s)]
*  I'm trying to get better at that. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3427.3s)]
*  I'm trying to get better at that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3428.92s)]
*  I think there's two, both things are good. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3430.0s)]
*  I think a lot of those comics probably would benefit [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3433.0s)]
*  from writing too. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3435.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3436.44s)]
*  You'd probably get some extra bits. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3437.28s)]
*  Yeah, like I'll sometimes, like it drives me nuts [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3438.12s)]
*  when I'll try to come up with stuff on stage or allow myself, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3440.2400000000002s)]
*  but if I don't record it, I'm like, ah, shit. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3443.1600000000003s)]
*  Like I was so in the moment. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3444.92s)]
*  Like I worked so hard to be present, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3446.68s)]
*  and then I'm like, I don't remember any of it. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3448.0s)]
*  Did you do Bottom of the Barrel Tuesday night? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3449.24s)]
*  Dude, I had the best time. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3451.2799999999997s)]
*  It's fun, right? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3452.96s)]
*  I had never done it before, and it was like, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  I kind of feel like you'll have a better metaphor for this, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3455.12s)]
*  but it's almost like doing Fat Man is like, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3457.52s)]
*  you know, doing your cardio, writing jokes is like, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3461.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, you're lifting, and then Bottom of the Barrel [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3464.4s)]
*  is like stretching or something. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3469.04s)]
*  Like it should be a part of what you do as a comic. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3470.16s)]
*  It's good to just be on a tightrope, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3474.0s)]
*  and not having any idea where you're going with things, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3477.88s)]
*  and then totally going the wrong way [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3480.16s)]
*  and trying to bail yourself out. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3481.8s)]
*  I got like three things out of it. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3483.48s)]
*  It's just like jumping off a cliff and flying, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3485.4s)]
*  and sort of, because I think that I get a little bit, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3487.6s)]
*  after I have a special come out, I start going, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3490.04s)]
*  okay, my next special is gonna be about this, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3492.2s)]
*  and then I kind of like have the tunnel vision [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3494.6s)]
*  about what the theme is gonna be, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3496.2s)]
*  and someone just, Hamas Christmas was literally one of them. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3498.56s)]
*  It was like to just riff on that. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3502.36s)]
*  I never would have thought to write about that, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3504.84s)]
*  because I'm like, oh, too touchy, too this. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3505.6800000000003s)]
*  It makes you braver, and it was like a muscle [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3507.44s)]
*  I hadn't flexed in a really long time. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3511.28s)]
*  It's also a unique situation because the audience knows [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3512.44s)]
*  that you're doing it, and you are clearly reaching in, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3516.6800000000003s)]
*  you're not preparing at all, you're reaching into this thing, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3520.84s)]
*  you're pulling out this piece of paper, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3523.44s)]
*  and there's this moment where you might have something [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3524.8s)]
*  on that, you know, like, oh. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3527.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3529.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3530.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3531.36s)]
*  Christmas with the relatives, or oh, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3532.2000000000003s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3534.76s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3535.6000000000004s)]
*  You're like, oh, okay, and then they get to see [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3536.42s)]
*  this process of you fucking around. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3537.88s)]
*  Yeah, it just was, and also I think sometimes [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3539.92s)]
*  you get into this, whether it's feedback from the internet [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3542.1600000000003s)]
*  or from other people, when people kind of tell you [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3545.32s)]
*  what kind of comic you are, you're kind of like, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3547.1600000000003s)]
*  oh, that's not a topic I would do, that's a topic [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3548.6000000000004s)]
*  Tim Dilla would do, that's a topic, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3550.44s)]
*  and then I'm kind of like, no, I could totally [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3552.1600000000003s)]
*  weigh in on that, but like, I don't only have to talk [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3553.7200000000003s)]
*  about relationships or being a woman, like, oh, that worked. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3556.0s)]
*  And it'll also get you out of whatever might be rigid [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3559.6800000000003s)]
*  and like, this is the worst when you see a comic [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3564.48s)]
*  they have a theme and they're kind of rigid with it, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3566.68s)]
*  and you feel like, oh man, you should be a little more loose, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3569.16s)]
*  it'll be more fun to watch, you know, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3573.4s)]
*  like you're a little too buttoned down with this thing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3575.16s)]
*  Yeah, and it also was like, you know, the topics [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3578.52s)]
*  were so incendiary and wild, you know, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3580.7999999999997s)]
*  to just, the permission from the audience, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3583.3199999999997s)]
*  like, go there, like go, don't hold back, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3585.64s)]
*  don't censor yourself, it was just like, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3589.72s)]
*  oh, okay, you guys want me to go here, right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3591.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just this like really cool, like jump kind of. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3593.48s)]
*  It's also, there's 110 people there, you know, it's small. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3596.64s)]
*  That room is my favorite. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3600.04s)]
*  It's a great little room. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3601.84s)]
*  The fact that you made, I mean, I was thinking [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3602.7599999999998s)]
*  about this last night when I was like, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3605.6s)]
*  how does a club that's only, what, two years old? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3606.7599999999998s)]
*  Not even, it's not even a year old. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3609.04s)]
*  Feel like it has so much history. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  I know. And like, soul. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3612.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's because of the building. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3614.6s)]
*  I think there's a reality about buildings, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3616.24s)]
*  and that's a 1927 theater, and I think there's something [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3619.52s)]
*  about old buildings. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3622.64s)]
*  I think memories are like legitimately burned into objects. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3624.16s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3628.2s)]
*  I think. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3629.04s)]
*  I'm not 90% sure. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3630.0s)]
*  I think this idea that things don't have something [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3631.64s)]
*  that's akin to consciousness, I think it's arrogant. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3635.3199999999997s)]
*  That building, I know it's like wishful thinking [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3639.24s)]
*  because it's my place and all that jazz, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3641.92s)]
*  but when we opened it, I felt like it was happy [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3643.68s)]
*  we were there. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3647.08s)]
*  I felt like even when I looked at it, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3648.48s)]
*  I felt like it was talking to me. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3651.6s)]
*  Like when I was going through it and like trying [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3653.48s)]
*  to figure out how I could do this and do that, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3655.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm looking around at it, it was like, come on, let's do it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3657.48s)]
*  What was that documentary ages ago called [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3662.04s)]
*  What the Bleep Do We Know? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  And remember the particles were in the water, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3666.12s)]
*  and when they were nice to it, the particles changed, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3669.3199999999997s)]
*  and when they were mean to it, I think the particles, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3672.4399999999996s)]
*  you know, there is. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3674.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's real. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3675.56s)]
*  That guy also ended up in the NXIVM cult, so. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3677.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there was also another person [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3679.6s)]
*  that was talking during that, I think she calls herself [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3682.12s)]
*  Ramtha, and she's channeling like a thousand year old alien [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3685.52s)]
*  or something. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3690.2s)]
*  So like her real name was different, but when she talks, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3691.24s)]
*  she talks in this wonderful way, and she's channeling. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3694.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of wacky shit in that film. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3698.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay, so they were doing The Secret, got it. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3703.24s)]
*  But there's just this feeling, and it's either way [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3706.2s)]
*  you've decorated the place, the people you've chosen [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3707.96s)]
*  to be there, it just, it feels like, it feels like, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3710.08s)]
*  sound corny, it feels like home. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3713.12s)]
*  Yeah, well that's what we wanted. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3714.6s)]
*  We tried to, we did everything we could to make it [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3716.8s)]
*  as comfortable for comedians as possible, and as much fun. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3718.92s)]
*  And to help promote the art form, and help promote [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3722.52s)]
*  up and coming artists, that's the big one. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3725.8s)]
*  It's like everyone who works there as a door person, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3728.68s)]
*  they all audition with their acts, the people that are [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3731.76s)]
*  going up on open mic nights, they have two nights [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3735.08s)]
*  of open mic nights to go up, Monday and Tuesday. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3737.52s)]
*  Dude, was it Miles? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3740.28s)]
*  I've seen Miles destroying in The Little Boy, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3742.36s)]
*  and then the next day I walked in and he was the door guy, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3746.8s)]
*  and I was like, you were the guy I could hardly follow [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3748.68s)]
*  last night? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3751.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's nice. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3753.36s)]
*  And I think my biggest concern when you were building, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3754.68s)]
*  and I was like, what if Joe doesn't like running a business? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3757.44s)]
*  It's just like a hassle, it's just like a hassle, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3759.8s)]
*  having employees, and they wanna do other things, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3761.96s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3764.28s)]
*  But everyone is part of this mission there, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3765.16s)]
*  everyone feels like a family, no one feels like [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3768.2s)]
*  they're just there to get some cash. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3770.24s)]
*  I think everybody realizes it's a very special thing [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3773.2799999999997s)]
*  that we've been able to put together, and the fact [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3776.2s)]
*  that the idea to put it together was really just to make, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3779.44s)]
*  it wasn't like a business idea, like this would be [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3782.48s)]
*  a great way to make money, it was the opposite. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3785.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, I just don't wanna lose any money, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3788.08s)]
*  but let's put together this business, let's put together [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3789.92s)]
*  this center, this one hub where the comedians [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3793.04s)]
*  can just be free, have fun, and feed off of each other, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3797.56s)]
*  and bang joke ideas around with each other [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3801.16s)]
*  in the green room, and watch each other do sets [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3804.56s)]
*  from the balcony. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3808.92s)]
*  Watching you, and being in the green room, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3810.4s)]
*  because look, sometimes you're kind of, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3813.56s)]
*  a lot of clubs, you're in a hallway, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3815.72s)]
*  and there's people coming by, and the way that you've [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3817.24s)]
*  really incubated comedians so that they feel safe [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3819.68s)]
*  and feel like they can be themselves, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3822.24s)]
*  especially before they go on stage. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3824.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, Ron White came off stage, and he had just done [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3825.96s)]
*  this bit, and he was trying to explain, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3829.12s)]
*  well, it didn't go how he wanted it to go. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3830.64s)]
*  Watching Ron White have a joke not go well [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3832.4399999999996s)]
*  for the first time in 30 years was funny to watch. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3836.7599999999998s)]
*  It was funny. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3839.04s)]
*  He was like, I just bombed for the first time. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3839.8799999999997s)]
*  And his fucking, his complete accepting of the bombing. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3841.3999999999996s)]
*  Like the way he was saying it, that fucking joke [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3847.0s)]
*  didn't get a single laugh. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3849.48s)]
*  They all agreed. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3852.36s)]
*  And we were trying to tell him, like, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3855.64s)]
*  I don't understand why you thought that was funny. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3856.84s)]
*  Well, clearly you were right. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3858.6s)]
*  He told the joke, and Joe goes, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3862.6s)]
*  yeah, I would have advised you against doing that joke. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3864.68s)]
*  But then we came up with alternative ways [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3870.36s)]
*  to do that joke, where it was ridiculous. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you went into this whole other thing, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3873.8s)]
*  and basically, I just watched you put a whole chunk together. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3875.92s)]
*  And we were all just there, just supporting each other, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3879.72s)]
*  and kind of writing, and everything's like, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3883.24s)]
*  you know, that's the best feeling in the world. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3885.52s)]
*  When you're sitting around a bunch of people, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3887.44s)]
*  you know you can't hurt their feelings. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3888.48s)]
*  You know you're not walking on eggshells, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3889.7599999999998s)]
*  and you can just. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3892.0s)]
*  And you know you're around a place of love. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3893.3199999999997s)]
*  That's it, that's it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3896.56s)]
*  And just go for it, just say it. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3898.56s)]
*  Everybody's, there's no tension in that room. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3900.52s)]
*  Zero. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3902.24s)]
*  Everybody's smiling. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3903.08s)]
*  Zero. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3904.0s)]
*  We're so lucky. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3904.8399999999997s)]
*  The best. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3905.68s)]
*  I feel so lucky sometimes. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3906.5s)]
*  I look forward to it so much. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3908.88s)]
*  It's like medicine. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3909.96s)]
*  When I'm not there for a few weeks, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3911.3s)]
*  and then I come back to town, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3912.92s)]
*  and I'm hanging out in the green room again, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3914.28s)]
*  everybody's like, hey. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3915.8s)]
*  You built this thing, though. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3917.44s)]
*  And there's also, it made me realize, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3918.8s)]
*  you have to be around the absence of something [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3921.12s)]
*  to realize there was a presence of something else [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3922.68s)]
*  that became so normal. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3924.52s)]
*  Is there's an absence of predatory energy? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3925.7599999999998s)]
*  I know that might sound weird, but the comics, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3929.48s)]
*  the, for whatever reason. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3932.5s)]
*  Nobody's trying to get something from you. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3934.12s)]
*  No one's trying to get you on their podcast. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3934.96s)]
*  No one's kind of just trying to get near you. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3936.7599999999998s)]
*  No one's trying to get a picture with you. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3938.2s)]
*  There's just this agreement. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3939.48s)]
*  We're just here to get better. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3940.64s)]
*  And we're just, we're a family in here, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3942.56s)]
*  and we're not trying to do anything [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3945.68s)]
*  except get better at comedy. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3947.64s)]
*  Right, there's always that weird moment [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3948.64s)]
*  where someone weasels into your conversation at the store, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3950.3199999999997s)]
*  and you don't know who that person is. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3953.3599999999997s)]
*  And then, hey, I'd love to talk to you about this project. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3954.9199999999996s)]
*  And you're like, ugh. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3957.2s)]
*  Or there's just a feeling of, this feels like work. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3958.64s)]
*  For some reason, we're just faking this. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3961.7599999999998s)]
*  It's also the Hollywood environment, too, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3963.8799999999997s)]
*  because everybody kind of has that attitude all day long. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3965.64s)]
*  How can you help me? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3968.56s)]
*  How can you? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3969.4s)]
*  That's a, it's a transactionary existence. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3970.24s)]
*  And these people are always looking [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3972.68s)]
*  to make these transactions. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3973.8399999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3975.16s)]
*  And move up the social ladder. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3976.0s)]
*  There was also a really cool thing [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3978.24s)]
*  the last couple nights I went up in the Little Boy Both nights [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3979.92s)]
*  and talked to a couple people in the audience. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3982.92s)]
*  There were like four people each night [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3986.44s)]
*  that were in from Australia just to come to the mothership. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3988.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3991.6s)]
*  They came just to come for the week [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3992.44s)]
*  to come to all the shows. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3994.36s)]
*  There was another guy, one of the guys [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3996.0s)]
*  that came from Australia, he did a road trip in America. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=3997.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh, what's your trip? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4000.2000000000003s)]
*  And he was like, I went to Austin, Ohio, and New York. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4001.56s)]
*  That's America. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4005.28s)]
*  That's pretty much America. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4006.96s)]
*  There was no. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4008.4s)]
*  Depends on what part of Ohio. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4009.2400000000002s)]
*  There was no, it was like a family thing or something [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4010.92s)]
*  like that, but no Disneyland in Florida, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4013.44s)]
*  no Universal Studios in LA. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4016.04s)]
*  It was just Austin, Ohio, New York. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4017.76s)]
*  I thought that was really cool. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4020.1200000000003s)]
*  It must be wild to go from one country. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4022.12s)]
*  If you've never been to America and you see the, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4024.48s)]
*  it's basically Europe, there's different countries here. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4027.44s)]
*  Every state feels like a different country. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4029.92s)]
*  It's a different country. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4031.64s)]
*  New York is such a different country than Texas. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4032.7599999999998s)]
*  LA, California is so different than Texas. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4035.4s)]
*  LA is also so different. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4038.88s)]
*  LA feels like a weird simulation now. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4040.48s)]
*  When's the last time you were on Sunset Boulevard? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4044.48s)]
*  It's been a few months, but last time I was there, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4046.4s)]
*  I was like, Jesus, this is weird. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4048.96s)]
*  It feels different. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4050.72s)]
*  It feels like the house of blues is gone. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4052.8s)]
*  It feels like it could fall apart at any minute. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4054.6000000000004s)]
*  It feels like something could go sideways at any minute [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4057.32s)]
*  and no one's gonna stop it. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4059.92s)]
*  And it's just reliant upon the good nature of people. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4061.6400000000003s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like people [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4064.44s)]
*  have as much restraint anymore. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4065.36s)]
*  It's just people are more desperate. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4067.92s)]
*  There's more tension and anger. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4070.36s)]
*  I mean, so many people lost everything [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4072.92s)]
*  during those two years. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4075.2000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4076.04s)]
*  So many people. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4076.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4077.7200000000003s)]
*  So many people. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4078.56s)]
*  I mean, I think that the first strike [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4079.44s)]
*  that was somewhat functioning, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4080.6800000000003s)]
*  Hollywood didn't work for two. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4083.28s)]
*  And then, I mean, because people think about Hollywood [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4084.88s)]
*  and they think about the annoying actors [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4086.6s)]
*  and the writers and the producers and the directors, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4088.08s)]
*  but it's mostly crew guys. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4090.56s)]
*  It's mostly the electric guys, the camera guys. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4092.0s)]
*  They're making $100 a day max [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4094.76s)]
*  and they live out in Santa Clarita. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4097.2s)]
*  Those are the ones that just truly will never come back. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4098.4s)]
*  Right, and then this last strike [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4101.52s)]
*  put another fucking nail in that. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4103.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4105.28s)]
*  Because both strikes. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4106.12s)]
*  They're not being in production for four years, basically. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4106.96s)]
*  They were talking about just how much the strike cost [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4110.32s)]
*  Los Angeles, just a strike. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4113.599999999999s)]
*  It's billions. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4115.759999999999s)]
*  Yep, and a lot of production actually, get ready. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4116.759999999999s)]
*  You left Hollywood and tried to escape [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4119.839999999999s)]
*  and it's coming to Austin. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4121.48s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4122.639999999999s)]
*  They're doing a lot of the film tax credit thing. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4123.48s)]
*  I think Bastrip, which by the way is awesome. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4127.2s)]
*  Have you been out to Bastrip? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4130.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4131.679999999999s)]
*  Ryan Holiday has his podcast out there. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4132.639999999999s)]
*  He bought a bookstore. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4135.0s)]
*  It looks like Mayberry. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4136.719999999999s)]
*  It's like this strip of a saloon and a bookstore. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4137.72s)]
*  It's so cute. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4141.56s)]
*  But Bastrip did, I don't remember what the TV show [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4143.320000000001s)]
*  was called, the shot that had Elizabeth Olsen [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4145.64s)]
*  and it's supposed to be really good. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4147.8s)]
*  And there's a couple other towns [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4149.8s)]
*  that are building studios out here. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4151.58s)]
*  I know, sorry. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4153.72s)]
*  Coming to get you. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4155.64s)]
*  They'll come. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4156.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they'll ruin it. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4158.88s)]
*  But I don't think they'll ever turn it into Hollywood. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4161.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4163.04s)]
*  What that thing was was a place that was created [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4164.0s)]
*  when they realized that it never rains. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4168.48s)]
*  They said, oh, we could film here all the time. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4170.5599999999995s)]
*  And so they just started moving everything out there [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4172.4s)]
*  and Johnny Carson moved out there [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4174.759999999999s)]
*  and all these different things happened [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  and they're doing all these movies. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4178.4s)]
*  And then the people that wanted to be famous [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4180.24s)]
*  moved out there too. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4182.5199999999995s)]
*  And even if they didn't make it in show business, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4183.48s)]
*  they became dentists, they became doctors, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4186.44s)]
*  they became, those people populated the area. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4188.799999999999s)]
*  So there's like an ethic, like a way of thinking [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4192.44s)]
*  in that area that would prioritize fame above everything. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4195.64s)]
*  And everyone that has other jobs there, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4199.8s)]
*  they're just trying to get a reality show about their job. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4201.68s)]
*  That's true too. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4204.08s)]
*  So I had a shoulder injury and I got this massage person [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4204.92s)]
*  to come help stretch it out, whatever. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4209.8s)]
*  And third or fourth session he comes, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4212.320000000001s)]
*  he's like, hey, I'm shooting a sizzle reel [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4214.6s)]
*  for what it's like to be a celebrity masseuse. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4215.92s)]
*  Will you be on it? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4218.0s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4218.84s)]
*  Can you just, I had a personal trainer [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4219.68s)]
*  who got a show at Netflix about being a trainer. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4221.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, can anyone just do what they do [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4223.58s)]
*  without the end goal actually trying to be famous? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4225.08s)]
*  Well, how about I'm a celebrity masseuse. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4227.36s)]
*  Can I get a sizzle reel? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4230.2s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4232.2s)]
*  I don't know how to break it to you. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4234.04s)]
*  You get famous for giving back rubs? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4235.16s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4237.32s)]
*  Truly. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4238.48s)]
*  A celebrity masseuse? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4239.5599999999995s)]
*  I know, it's just everybody's trying to get famous [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4240.76s)]
*  and whatever vocation they're doing [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4243.7s)]
*  is just to try to get famous. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4245.2s)]
*  I wanna be a famous interior designer. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4246.68s)]
*  I wanna be a famous dentist. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4248.12s)]
*  I wanna be a Hollywood center. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4249.28s)]
*  But also if you want to be more successful [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4250.32s)]
*  and get more clients, that is the way to do it. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4253.18s)]
*  I mean, if you're utilizing social media, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4255.820000000001s)]
*  like if you're a trainer and you look awesome, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4258.160000000001s)]
*  you're gonna get a lot of clients on social media [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4260.5s)]
*  just from that. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4262.34s)]
*  It's actually a good marketing move, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4263.740000000001s)]
*  but it also has that gravity of possible YouTube [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4265.700000000001s)]
*  slash TikTok slash whatever fame. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4269.9800000000005s)]
*  And then you say, okay, I can make a living off of this. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4272.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's just a, I don't know. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4275.38s)]
*  I think for me, it's like, what we do is like, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4277.22s)]
*  I was talking to one of your guys up front [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4280.34s)]
*  and being a comedian, it's weird [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4283.860000000001s)]
*  because there's a point where you go, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4285.14s)]
*  now that I'm having a kid and I'm kind of like, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4287.5s)]
*  oh, you can't undo fame. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4289.0s)]
*  You can't undo that. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4290.860000000001s)]
*  And I remember. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4292.9400000000005s)]
*  You could fade away. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4294.5s)]
*  You can fade away. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4295.42s)]
*  You can become irrelevant for sure. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4296.26s)]
*  But especially at this day and age, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4298.540000000001s)]
*  you have to fight so hard to probably stay famous. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4300.18s)]
*  But it's one of those things, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4301.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember Bill Murray said one time, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4305.040000000001s)]
*  someone asked him, do you hate being famous or something? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4308.06s)]
*  And he goes, what I would say to people [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4310.5s)]
*  that want to be famous is try getting rich [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4311.74s)]
*  and see if you still need to get famous. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4313.26s)]
*  Which I kind of liked because sometimes you're like, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4315.9s)]
*  no, I just want to be able to pay my bills. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4317.74s)]
*  But as a comic, I remember thinking like, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4319.099999999999s)]
*  no, you have to get famous for people to buy tickets. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4321.54s)]
*  There's no way otherwise. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4324.38s)]
*  I got to get a sitcom so people know me [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4326.58s)]
*  and then they're going to come see me do standup. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4328.74s)]
*  I was just talking to Burt and he ran into a group [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4330.66s)]
*  of comedians that aren't doing so well [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4334.139999999999s)]
*  and aren't selling tickets on the road. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4336.099999999999s)]
*  And they were asking to go with him and this and that. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4337.5s)]
*  And he's like, oh Jesus, it's not easy for everybody. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4340.3s)]
*  There's some people that for whatever reason, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4344.179999999999s)]
*  they never marketed themselves very well, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4346.54s)]
*  they never got the attention they felt like [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4348.9s)]
*  they should have deserved and now they're in their 50s [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4351.0s)]
*  and they can't sell out of club and they're fucked. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4354.0199999999995s)]
*  And they can't make a living so they're not paying their rent [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4357.28s)]
*  and it's like, it's not good. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4360.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a tricky one and not to plug, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4362.78s)]
*  the special coming out, I know you and Matt Reif [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4367.04s)]
*  talked about OFTV, it's OnlyFans the TV section [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4369.0s)]
*  where I'm doing their first special. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4371.96s)]
*  But they're doing, remember live at Gotham? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4373.92s)]
*  Remember there was Evening of the Improv? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4377.16s)]
*  There used to be specials for comics [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4378.68s)]
*  that couldn't get the Netflix special, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4381.44s)]
*  couldn't necessarily do the hour. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4382.8s)]
*  If you were maybe a quote middle class comedian, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4384.08s)]
*  you could at least get screen time or get a good tape. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4386.8s)]
*  You could go on found or whatever. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4389.1s)]
*  You could headline it on a road club. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4390.56s)]
*  That doesn't exist anymore. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4392.72s)]
*  So it's cool that they're actually doing that [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4394.72s)]
*  so that comics that can't necessarily get the hour special [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4396.44s)]
*  or sell out clubs can at least get some kind of TV exposure [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4399.16s)]
*  because Comedy Central's just like a square space [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4402.4s)]
*  at this point. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4406.2s)]
*  It's just like a plug-in. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4407.04s)]
*  I don't even know how to get it. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4408.0s)]
*  Yeah, isn't it quickly how that dropped off from relevancy? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4409.599999999999s)]
*  Wild. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4414.08s)]
*  It used to be the most important thing to get on. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4414.919999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4417.0s)]
*  And that was just 10 years ago. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4417.839999999999s)]
*  2013. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4419.5199999999995s)]
*  That was 10 years ago. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4420.5199999999995s)]
*  It was very important to get on Comedy Central. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4421.48s)]
*  Oh my God, they had South Park, they had this, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4423.879999999999s)]
*  they had that, Chappelle Show. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4426.72s)]
*  I mean, fuck. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4428.5599999999995s)]
*  And you could have a set from Live at Gotham. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4429.72s)]
*  You could have your half hour premium blend. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4432.16s)]
*  They'd put it on the improv website [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4433.88s)]
*  and you would sell out a couple nights. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4435.4s)]
*  And then you could do local radio, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4438.28s)]
*  which doesn't really exist anymore. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4439.96s)]
*  Doesn't exist anymore either. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4441.12s)]
*  You remember you would go in early to Chicago [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4442.2s)]
*  to do Man Cow or whatever. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4443.96s)]
*  Whatever, yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4446.6s)]
*  I used to enjoy those. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4449.04s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why I started doing a podcast. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4450.4s)]
*  I used to think, boy, I would love to do a radio show, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4453.04s)]
*  but who the fuck is gonna pay me to do a radio show? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4456.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'd ruin it, I'd say something stupid. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4458.44s)]
*  It wouldn't work. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4462.04s)]
*  You'd have to take notes. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4463.6s)]
*  You'd have to. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4464.44s)]
*  Yeah, well I'd have to show up, I couldn't swear. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4465.28s)]
*  That's the weird thing. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4468.68s)]
*  You think about the rulings that they had on radio [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4471.44s)]
*  and how there's none on the internet. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4475.56s)]
*  That is crazy to think on the radio. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4477.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're at 5 a.m. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4480.48s)]
*  Yeah, if you said shit, you were in trouble. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4481.96s)]
*  If you said fuck, the radio station would get fined. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4485.28s)]
*  They could get fined hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4488.72s)]
*  The stern things that happened during [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4492.24s)]
*  the Bush administration, people forget, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4494.84s)]
*  but there was no internet. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4497.8s)]
*  There was just stern. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4499.52s)]
*  And he was the only one like that, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4501.04s)]
*  that was just this wild boy on the radio in the morning [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4503.4800000000005s)]
*  and everybody tuned in to see what the fuck is he gonna say. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4506.36s)]
*  And during the Bush administration, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4509.68s)]
*  because he was pretty critical of the Bush administration, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4512.200000000001s)]
*  they went after him and they fined his radio station. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4514.8s)]
*  I think they fined the company somewhere in the millions. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4519.080000000001s)]
*  But don't you think that the more they fined him, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4523.8s)]
*  it's kind of like the more when they try to cancel comedians, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4526.080000000001s)]
*  the more successful they get. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4528.200000000001s)]
*  It's like the more, he just got more. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4529.240000000001s)]
*  Well he was already huge, but I think it was very touch [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4530.8s)]
*  and go for freedom of speech. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4533.92s)]
*  Because they were just making these claims [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4535.92s)]
*  about certain things being obscene. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4538.56s)]
*  But meanwhile, that is. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4541.88s)]
*  I mean there were porn stars queefing on. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4543.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, normal stuff. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4545.6s)]
*  But like online now, that's nothing. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4546.4400000000005s)]
*  You think about, no one's trying to shut down Instagram, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4549.96s)]
*  but I watched two people get murdered this morning [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4552.4400000000005s)]
*  while I was taking a shit. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4554.04s)]
*  Two different people. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4555.56s)]
*  But I feel like YouTube is starting to age restrict. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4557.88s)]
*  And I've got a couple things for my podcast age restricted [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4560.76s)]
*  because we said porn star, people are saying corn star now, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4564.8s)]
*  which seems way dirtier. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4568.400000000001s)]
*  To trick the algorithm. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4572.16s)]
*  And vaccine you say, you can't even say the jab anymore. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4573.36s)]
*  I don't know, I think Russell Brand figured out [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4575.92s)]
*  something to say. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4577.88s)]
*  If you say vaccine, they'll. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4578.719999999999s)]
*  Special sauce. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4580.36s)]
*  Yeah, they'll demonetize you or they'll, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4581.36s)]
*  are they special sauce? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4583.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they do use it, they use a machine, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4584.28s)]
*  some sort of machine learning that picks up. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4587.2s)]
*  It's not like an individual reviews every single podcast. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4589.5199999999995s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  But you can ask for a review if they decide [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4593.4s)]
*  that it's demonetized. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4596.12s)]
*  But they also kind of weaponize that. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4597.4s)]
*  It seems like that demonetization is a strategy [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4599.52s)]
*  to make you self censor. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4602.160000000001s)]
*  Yep, 100%. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4603.400000000001s)]
*  And age restricting. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4604.88s)]
*  Like to put in your age and all that is such a hassle. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4605.84s)]
*  But I know that I think me, Theo, Santino, Bobby, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4608.240000000001s)]
*  we all, we bleep the first 10 minutes of curse words. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4611.84s)]
*  Hmm, interesting. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4614.8s)]
*  You kind of have to. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4616.160000000001s)]
*  When we left YouTube, when we announced [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4617.320000000001s)]
*  that we were going over to Spotify, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4621.8s)]
*  one of the first things that happened [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  is YouTube stopped demonetizing us. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4624.8s)]
*  Completely, they just said, okay, well, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4627.280000000001s)]
*  YouTube's not gonna be here for very much longer. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4628.76s)]
*  It's only over three more months. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4630.320000000001s)]
*  Let's make all the money. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4631.96s)]
*  We didn't get, right? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4633.280000000001s)]
*  It was another case, like, did we get any demonetized [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4634.12s)]
*  once we make this switch? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4636.72s)]
*  That's what it seemed like happened, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4637.84s)]
*  but no one officially said that or did that [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4638.96s)]
*  or anything like that. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4641.76s)]
*  What a diplomatic answer. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4642.6s)]
*  Good job. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4643.88s)]
*  And they're trying to say it's to protect kids, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4644.72s)]
*  which I'm all about protecting kids, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4646.400000000001s)]
*  but doesn't YouTube have their own kids channel, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4647.84s)]
*  kids tube or something? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4650.88s)]
*  Yeah, the thing is, like, people don't pay attention [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4652.04s)]
*  to what the fucking kids are watching. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4654.08s)]
*  So it's like, we're doing the job of the parents. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4655.76s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4657.56s)]
*  I remember when YouTube had that problem [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4658.879999999999s)]
*  because there was cartoons that seemed like regular kid [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4660.5599999999995s)]
*  cartoons, but then they would get really violent [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4664.04s)]
*  and Mickey Mouse would get super drunk [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4666.719999999999s)]
*  and hit people over the head with bottles. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4668.799999999999s)]
*  Do you know that, I mean, half of porn now [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4670.4s)]
*  is like Shrek getting blown by Elsa from Frozen. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4672.879999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4677.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4677.96s)]
*  But also, we grew up on Ren and Stimpy [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4679.719999999999s)]
*  in Beavis and Butthead. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4682.04s)]
*  I mean, that shit was bonkers. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4683.2s)]
*  Wild, yeah. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4685.24s)]
*  But did you, were you aware of that whole trend [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4686.72s)]
*  where there was this like, so like, say if a kid [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4689.84s)]
*  was watching YouTube and you're watching some cartoons, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4693.08s)]
*  these people who made these cartoons, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4696.4400000000005s)]
*  and I think they rooted out a lot of them [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4698.200000000001s)]
*  and got rid of them, but these people [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4699.84s)]
*  that made these cartoons, they would figure out a way [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4701.320000000001s)]
*  to get into that algorithm so that the kids, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4703.96s)]
*  it would just play the next video [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4706.88s)]
*  and then play the next video [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4708.4800000000005s)]
*  and then they would play one of these. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4709.6s)]
*  And one of these videos, it was always weird. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4711.360000000001s)]
*  It's like someone would always get drunk, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4713.12s)]
*  someone would fall down, break their head open, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4715.28s)]
*  there would be blood everywhere. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4717.36s)]
*  It was really weird. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4718.44s)]
*  Is it like people trying to like psychologically [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4719.84s)]
*  harm kids or is it just a accident? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4723.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what they were doing, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4725.16s)]
*  but they were cartoons that seemed to be [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4726.96s)]
*  like regular kids' cartoons, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4729.759999999999s)]
*  but they would follow a very specific pattern. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4731.24s)]
*  There was always a broken bottle, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4733.5199999999995s)]
*  there was always a lot of blood, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4735.0s)]
*  but it was like Mickey Mouse and fucking Goofy and shit. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4736.599999999999s)]
*  For instance, this is not like a well-known one. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4739.679999999999s)]
*  I just picked one, but this is like a bunch [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4742.24s)]
*  of known characters doing a bunch of weird shit. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4744.76s)]
*  Yeah, but this is like live action. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  It's just what some of them were, 100%. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4751.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4753.04s)]
*  This channel has 700,000 followers. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4753.88s)]
*  But what's the? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4756.320000000001s)]
*  Sex went 7 million views on this video. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4758.64s)]
*  It would fall into, honestly, it's just algorithm. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4762.120000000001s)]
*  They were like manipulating the algorithm. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4764.400000000001s)]
*  They're just trying to benefit off the algorithm. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4765.8s)]
*  Anything that would click off of a kid watching Frozen [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4767.64s)]
*  or Elsa or Spider-Man or the Joker or anything [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4769.280000000001s)]
*  and it would just hope that one of these [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4771.56s)]
*  would eventually fall in there. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4773.08s)]
*  So they're baiting kids with the iconic characters. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4774.16s)]
*  Because kids are just watching it all day long. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4776.36s)]
*  The amount of times the kids would watch [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4778.0s)]
*  Disney and shit or Nickelodeon, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4779.16s)]
*  it's kind of all gone away. And if you're eight, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4780.2s)]
*  you want to watch Elsa from Frozen. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4781.04s)]
*  Sure, they don't know whether this is bad or not. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4782.44s)]
*  But this doesn't seem as fucked up. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4784.08s)]
*  100% this was, but it just started, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4786.32s)]
*  people started getting crazier with it [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4788.2s)]
*  and crazier with it and crazier with it. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4789.639999999999s)]
*  Then you would find some weird, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4790.92s)]
*  I think people were making claims that there was then, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4792.32s)]
*  like child porn stuff was getting mixed in here. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4795.72s)]
*  Not fully on YouTube, but it was, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4798.44s)]
*  definitely there were videos crossing the line. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4800.24s)]
*  Like I have friends that used to, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4802.12s)]
*  I almost did this when I was struggling for money [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4803.68s)]
*  back in the day. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4806.12s)]
*  You put up like football games [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4807.16s)]
*  or clips from football games up, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4808.88s)]
*  you know they're going to get taken down, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4810.28s)]
*  but you can get like, you know, quick, you know, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4811.68s)]
*  50,000 views or something. You know what I mean? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4814.04s)]
*  Just like NFL, they're going to take it down, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4816.0s)]
*  but it's enough to get a check. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4818.28s)]
*  I think they catch it faster, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4819.76s)]
*  but that feels like what that is too, right? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4821.28s)]
*  It's definitely a strategy. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4823.08s)]
*  It's just people, you can sit at home and find a way [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4824.16s)]
*  to get money off of this system [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4826.08s)]
*  because there's so many holes in it. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4828.04s)]
*  Because you know it's just going to pop up and a kid, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4828.88s)]
*  it's going to say suggested for you, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4830.68s)]
*  the kid's going to click on it and you're going to get paid. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4831.96s)]
*  Jamie, what were those cartoons? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4834.12s)]
*  Have they rooted out all those cartoons? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4835.52s)]
*  Are they gone? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4837.28s)]
*  I mean, you know what I'm talking about, right? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4838.16s)]
*  Look, I just clicked on a different one. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4840.4s)]
*  Look at the screen. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4842.28s)]
*  Like right below it is the Elsa Spider-Man cartoon thing. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4843.12s)]
*  Cartoon hookups, there you go. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4845.92s)]
*  This is 600,000 people on this channel. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4848.08s)]
*  This has a million views seven years ago. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4850.4800000000005s)]
*  It's all just finding holes to get into this. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4852.56s)]
*  Elsa and Spider-Man have sex. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4855.36s)]
*  Look at Elsa's titties bouncing. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4857.16s)]
*  Okay, her tits should not look like that. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4858.0s)]
*  They're bouncing a lot. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4859.44s)]
*  I see the whiskey in the corner. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4860.6s)]
*  Batman's sad. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4862.320000000001s)]
*  Uh oh, Batman in black face, offensive. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4863.280000000001s)]
*  This is easier to make than the live action one [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4866.240000000001s)]
*  because one person can make this [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4868.04s)]
*  instead of you needing seven actors to get together. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4869.320000000001s)]
*  But like some kid in Pensacola made this. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4871.200000000001s)]
*  Most likely, I mean, I don't know for sure. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4873.4800000000005s)]
*  But the weird ones were kids cartoons [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4875.52s)]
*  that were cartoons like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4878.56s)]
*  You remember what I'm talking about? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4882.200000000001s)]
*  Which were pretty violent to begin with. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4883.400000000001s)]
*  This is just an extension of this was a very deep network [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4885.360000000001s)]
*  of all sorts of weird stuff. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4887.72s)]
*  A lot of those are probably now taken down. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4888.96s)]
*  This was six or seven years ago. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4891.32s)]
*  I'm sure they've done some work to get rid of that. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4892.16s)]
*  Just see if you can find any of those old cartoons [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4894.0s)]
*  because they were so weird. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4896.24s)]
*  It didn't make sense. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4897.679999999999s)]
*  Like I'm surprised that they don't have more [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4899.4s)]
*  parental controls on YouTube. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4901.799999999999s)]
*  Not that I'm advocating for it, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4905.0s)]
*  but it must be a nightmare to be a parent. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4906.32s)]
*  Well just think about the sheer number of people [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4907.839999999999s)]
*  that are posting things every minute of every day [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4909.839999999999s)]
*  all over the world. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4912.24s)]
*  I mean the volume. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4913.639999999999s)]
*  There's an article from 2017, what is going on? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4914.48s)]
*  Spider-Man and Elsa have taken over YouTube [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4917.32s)]
*  and it's confusing. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4919.04s)]
*  If you're a kid and you just watched Spider-Man, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4920.6s)]
*  you're just gonna Google it all day. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4922.6s)]
*  The videos are gone though. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4923.88s)]
*  That's gonna be the thing. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4925.08s)]
*  But this kind of makes more sense to me [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4925.92s)]
*  because it's like those two things [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4928.12s)]
*  were very popular at the time. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4929.8s)]
*  There you go, wait, wait, wait. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4931.36s)]
*  It said having them get buried alive. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4932.36s)]
*  There's an ungodly nightmare depicting everything [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4934.8s)]
*  from characters being buried alive to peeing on each other. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4936.52s)]
*  What? Sick. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4940.0s)]
*  See these videos are all gone. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4942.56s)]
*  Oh, the videos are removed. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4943.92s)]
*  They've definitely probably created a team [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4945.4s)]
*  to get rid of them. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4946.8s)]
*  This created such a problem for them six, seven years ago. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4947.64s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4950.64s)]
*  This is part of an adpocalypse. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4951.6s)]
*  It's like adpocalypse two, I think, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4952.92s)]
*  is what happened with this. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4954.4400000000005s)]
*  Adpocalypse one was a whole different thing. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4955.360000000001s)]
*  Same reason they're in adult ones. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4957.28s)]
*  It keeps them glued to the screen. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4958.72s)]
*  Yeah, just pregnant kids. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4960.16s)]
*  The whole thing is very strange. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4962.72s)]
*  But it's also, that's what happens [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4964.92s)]
*  when you have these platforms [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4966.52s)]
*  where anybody can post anything [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4969.12s)]
*  and then people try to figure out a way to manipulate it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4970.96s)]
*  What's the best way to get people [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4973.2s)]
*  to pay attention to your stuff. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4974.16s)]
*  So the people at work, they were constantly just whack-a-mole [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4975.76s)]
*  trying to get the toxic stuff down. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4977.76s)]
*  Look at how many people are doing these prank videos. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4980.2s)]
*  They go up to people and prank them [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4982.280000000001s)]
*  and just to try to get reactions. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4984.400000000001s)]
*  People getting shot. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4986.56s)]
*  See that guy that got shot in the mall? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4987.52s)]
*  No. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4989.24s)]
*  Some guy wouldn't stop fucking with this dude [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4990.16s)]
*  and the guy just pulls out a gun and shoots him. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4992.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, I did see that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4994.280000000001s)]
*  I was gonna say mall seems like the most dangerous place [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4995.12s)]
*  to be at this point. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4997.04s)]
*  Remember when we just walked around malls [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=4998.04s)]
*  for five hours as teenagers with no money? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5000.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, malls were like the playground for teenagers. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5002.84s)]
*  Now it's just smashing crabs, people getting shot. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5005.04s)]
*  I've showed you this before, but it's gotten way worse. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5007.12s)]
*  On Twitch, which is supposed to be for video games. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5011.4s)]
*  Watch people play video games, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  maybe talk and do some interviews or podcasts. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5014.76s)]
*  They expanded it into this area now called [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5017.6s)]
*  pools, hot tubs and beaches. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5020.12s)]
*  And as you can see, it's just mostly 100% girls [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5022.12s)]
*  just sitting at a pool, hot tub or beach, mostly naked. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5025.32s)]
*  Mostly on their knees. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5029.28s)]
*  And most of this I found out after watching it [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5030.24s)]
*  for a little bit and doing some research. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5033.36s)]
*  They're just leading to their OnlyFans account. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5035.2s)]
*  Look at this one, yoga workout time. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5037.28s)]
*  Look at the pose. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5039.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing yoga. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5040.679999999999s)]
*  The one in the corner, that's yoga. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5042.16s)]
*  Look at my ass, it's yoga. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5044.36s)]
*  There's body painting that goes on [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5046.76s)]
*  while they're literally just like all about naked [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5048.12s)]
*  with a little bit of paint covering [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5050.48s)]
*  the proper nipple areola area. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5052.12s)]
*  There's a lot of gals that are making a living [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5054.96s)]
*  doing this stuff these days. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5056.84s)]
*  Like way more than ever before. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5058.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, the pandemic. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5062.84s)]
*  Working at Walgreens. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5064.360000000001s)]
*  The pandemic is when it really hit hard. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5066.280000000001s)]
*  I can't say if I was 22. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5070.56s)]
*  If I was 22. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5073.52s)]
*  If I was 22. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5075.08s)]
*  I don't know what I would have done. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5075.92s)]
*  I'd be out there doing yoga in my underwear. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5078.64s)]
*  If that's all I had to do. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5080.96s)]
*  If OnlyFans was around when I was 22, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5082.8s)]
*  I don't know if I wouldn't be doing yoga [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5084.68s)]
*  and with wrapped in ropes. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5086.88s)]
*  The thing is, if you get in that, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5088.4400000000005s)]
*  there's two arguments, right? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5091.400000000001s)]
*  If you get in that ecosystem [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5092.72s)]
*  and that's what you do for money now [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5095.160000000001s)]
*  and you start making a lot of money, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5097.200000000001s)]
*  you're gonna get very accustomed to making a lot of money. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5098.96s)]
*  So if an office job comes up in the field of your choice [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5101.0s)]
*  and then they have to go, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5105.12s)]
*  hey Whitney, can you come in the office? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5105.96s)]
*  We just discovered your Twitch underwear page. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5107.68s)]
*  Tricky. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5111.76s)]
*  And what's going on here? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5112.6s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5115.360000000001s)]
*  You represent this company [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5116.200000000001s)]
*  and we sell air conditioning units. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5117.84s)]
*  It's like, you can't be. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  You might literally not be able [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5121.24s)]
*  to get a regular job anymore. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5123.08s)]
*  That's probably true. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5124.32s)]
*  But then here's the other thing. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5127.28s)]
*  If you do get a regular job, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5128.64s)]
*  what are you doing it for? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5130.24s)]
*  You're doing it for money, right? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5131.08s)]
*  Can't you make way more money showing your asshole? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5132.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5133.72s)]
*  So I mean, the heartening thing actually about OnlyFans [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5134.56s)]
*  is a lot of it is like women breastfeeding. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5138.28s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5141.2s)]
*  A lot of it. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5142.04s)]
*  That's taken over into that as well. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5142.88s)]
*  Imagine if you could have an image. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5143.88s)]
*  You know how you could see likes and views? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5146.6s)]
*  What if there was an image of every guy [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5148.4s)]
*  jerking off to you breastfeeding? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5150.04s)]
*  Just like, you could just pop up into a window [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5151.8s)]
*  and see like a thousand squares. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5154.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5156.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5157.2s)]
*  there's something wholesome about it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5158.68s)]
*  And also it feels like there's this, I don't know, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5160.24s)]
*  at least on OnlyFans what I've seen, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5163.16s)]
*  because also I have an OnlyFans account [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5165.2s)]
*  that's just for jokes. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5166.72s)]
*  So instead of dirty photos and dirty videos, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5168.68s)]
*  it's just dirty jokes. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5170.36s)]
*  A lot of like comics are starting to make money on there. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5171.32s)]
*  Just put your jokes on there [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5173.32s)]
*  that you'll get canceled for saying it on Twitter. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5174.5199999999995s)]
*  It's kind of like Patreon or whatever. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5176.96s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5178.48s)]
*  that are like influencers and chefs and stuff like that [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5179.599999999999s)]
*  on OnlyFans now making money on there [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5183.24s)]
*  the way you would on Patreon. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5185.32s)]
*  But it's interesting because remember, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5186.719999999999s)]
*  like porn, you used to develop a relationship [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5188.28s)]
*  with one porn star. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5190.32s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of guys that kind of [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5191.759999999999s)]
*  want to be monogamous with their person. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5193.719999999999s)]
*  And that's part of the reason [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5196.799999999999s)]
*  these women are making so much money. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5197.719999999999s)]
*  They get tips. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5198.799999999999s)]
*  They have like, like Angela White. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5199.639999999999s)]
*  She came on my podcast. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5202.28s)]
*  Her biggest moneymaker is DMing with men [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5203.44s)]
*  and sending them customized videos. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5206.92s)]
*  And then the men want to be shrunk [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5208.5199999999995s)]
*  and for her to put them in her pocket. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5210.799999999999s)]
*  And she just sends a video of her [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5213.599999999999s)]
*  putting the man in her pocket. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5217.759999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5219.5599999999995s)]
*  Remember that lit video with Pam Anderson [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5220.4s)]
*  when we were younger? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5221.879999999999s)]
*  Is that some weird fantasy back to that? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5222.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5225.32s)]
*  You make me completely miserable. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5226.16s)]
*  I think sometimes she eats them. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5226.98s)]
*  For a little more, I think she'll eat them. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5227.82s)]
*  But it's like, a lot of it seems like it's not just, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5229.48s)]
*  because you can find buttholes and crazy sex [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5232.879999999999s)]
*  anywhere on Pornhub. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5235.28s)]
*  It's just some weird fetish. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5236.759999999999s)]
*  It's like that exactly. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5238.52s)]
*  And she shrinks them down. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5240.68s)]
*  She goes into Photoshop. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5241.82s)]
*  She's very savvy with the Photoshop. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5242.78s)]
*  Shrinks them and then puts them in her pocket. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5244.52s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5247.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5248.48s)]
*  So, it's pretty wild. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5249.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5251.64s)]
*  I mean, it seems like there's like a, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5252.48s)]
*  I think there's some men on there [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5254.2s)]
*  that kind of don't want to just see some stranger. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5255.72s)]
*  Cause also you go on Pornhub and all these places. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5257.76s)]
*  And you're like, I don't know how old this person is. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5260.4s)]
*  I don't, it's a lot of step brother and steps. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5261.92s)]
*  I don't know what I'm looking at. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5264.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5265.92s)]
*  I kind of see a woman breastfeeding. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5266.76s)]
*  So I know that she's, you know. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5268.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there's gotta be weird kinks [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5270.64s)]
*  outside of just like regular sex stuff. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5273.08s)]
*  Like how many guys like to get their balls stomped on? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5275.2s)]
*  What is that? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5278.16s)]
*  What is that? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5279.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5280.8s)]
*  That can't be good. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5281.64s)]
*  I think some of it is CEOs. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5283.16s)]
*  I think there's- [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5285.68s)]
*  Being denigrated, being humiliated. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5286.52s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5288.08s)]
*  I think there's some of these guys [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5288.92s)]
*  that are the head of these giant corporations [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5289.92s)]
*  and they're under so much crazy stress. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5291.64s)]
*  And they take some sort of jolly [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5293.8s)]
*  and getting kicked in the nuts, told what to do. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5297.4400000000005s)]
*  Like Dominatrix's, they'll tell you, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5299.72s)]
*  they deal with these like high stress guys [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5301.92s)]
*  that run businesses. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5304.08s)]
*  I have a friend that did that for a while. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5305.400000000001s)]
*  She sold, she would send guys, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5307.400000000001s)]
*  this one guy photos of her feet, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5309.88s)]
*  but she would demand like money from him. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5311.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what he was into. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5313.8s)]
*  Like send me a hundred dollars right now kind of thing. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5314.96s)]
*  And then she would insult him. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5317.12s)]
*  She would just go to his house and insult him [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5319.96s)]
*  while he would jerk off. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5321.68s)]
*  They call them humiliatrix's. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5323.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5325.36s)]

*  Like okay. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5327.4s)]
*  Cool. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5329.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm encouraged by how popular milf porn is. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5330.8s)]
*  That's very promising. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5333.5199999999995s)]
*  It's very promising. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5335.0s)]
*  Well, milfs can keep it together these days. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5335.84s)]
*  It used to be they didn't lift weights. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5338.599999999999s)]
*  They didn't take care of their nutrition. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5340.5599999999995s)]
*  They didn't lift weights. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5342.599999999999s)]
*  So they hit a certain point in time and you know. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5343.44s)]
*  And then there was the milfs that were like, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5346.96s)]
*  they had that much sand left in the hourglass. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5349.92s)]
*  And so they were really horny. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5352.04s)]
*  Because they knew they only had like that much more time [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5353.44s)]
*  where men found them desirable. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5356.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5357.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5358.72s)]
*  I didn't know if it was that because I remember, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5359.56s)]
*  you remember when I made that robot for one of my specials, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5360.68s)]
*  I went down to the robot making factory [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5364.16s)]
*  and they told me the most popular request [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5365.8s)]
*  for the sex doll nipples were large and brown. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5367.56s)]
*  Like the nipple being like almost as big as the boob [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5371.5199999999995s)]
*  and dark, which is what happens when you breastfeed. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5374.16s)]
*  Your nipples get darker. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5376.2s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5377.04s)]
*  So I thought it was some primordial thing. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5377.88s)]
*  Ooh, could be. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5379.28s)]
*  About like dark nipples or something. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5380.76s)]
*  Right, it could be. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5382.12s)]
*  It's like a maternal thing. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5383.280000000001s)]
*  Or people are just, guys are watching milf porn [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5387.0s)]
*  to be like, is that what my wife's supposed to look like? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5389.08s)]
*  Maybe just comparing, I don't know. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5391.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5393.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's always heartening when you go to a porn site [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5394.320000000001s)]
*  and milf is number one. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5395.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5396.92s)]
*  What's generally the milf fucks the stepson. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5397.76s)]
*  That's a lot of it. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5401.6s)]
*  That's, what is that? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5402.56s)]
*  Well, the dad is an asshole. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5404.4400000000005s)]
*  He was a shitty dad. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5406.52s)]
*  He was never home. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5407.6s)]
*  He was mean. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5408.6s)]
*  And then he gets rid of the mom [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5409.72s)]
*  and gets this new hot monster that lives in his house [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5411.92s)]
*  that's just a cock addict. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5416.16s)]
*  And then. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5418.280000000001s)]
*  Are we running out of taboos, guys? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5419.320000000001s)]
*  Are we running out of, when did sex get so boring, guys? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5421.280000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the most likely one. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5424.320000000001s)]
*  Cause you couldn't do it the other way. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5425.52s)]
*  I guess you could, but it'd be way creepier. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5426.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5428.72s)]
*  You know, it was the stepdad and the daughter. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5429.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, thanks. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5431.84s)]
*  That's really creepy. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5432.68s)]
*  I'm good on that. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5433.52s)]
*  Right, isn't it funny? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5434.360000000001s)]
*  They do that. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5435.360000000001s)]
*  I know they do that, but isn't it funny [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5436.2s)]
*  that the stepdad and the daughter creeps me out, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5437.5599999999995s)]
*  but the stepson's like, ha, ha. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5440.0s)]
*  For some reason, for some reason, what is that? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5441.719999999999s)]
*  It's like, if you were to do like, professor student, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5444.599999999999s)]
*  you'd be like, ugh, but if it's like teacher and guy, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5447.799999999999s)]
*  you're like, oh, good for him. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5452.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5453.719999999999s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5455.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just, we don't worry about boys [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5456.799999999999s)]
*  the way we worry about girls. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5459.639999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5461.28s)]
*  I've been trying to write a bit about this for so long, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5462.12s)]
*  and I think there's a lot of reasons I can't crack it, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5463.639999999999s)]
*  but it is really like, when boys get molested, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5465.76s)]
*  nobody cares. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5468.400000000001s)]
*  Nope. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5469.64s)]
*  Well, they do if they get molested by men. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5470.4800000000005s)]
*  Then it's murderous. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5472.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5473.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and if like an actress in LA [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5475.4400000000005s)]
*  gets hugged too long at a Christmas party, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5477.400000000001s)]
*  like we shut down the city. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5478.88s)]
*  Variety rates, front page article. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5480.24s)]
*  We march, the highways are shut down. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5482.16s)]
*  Like everyone gets fired. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5484.8s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5487.72s)]
*  And then there's also that some women, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5489.320000000001s)]
*  particularly in Hollywood, they use seduction [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5492.96s)]
*  to ingratiate them with people. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5496.8s)]
*  They will flirt with people to get closer to producers. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5498.64s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5502.4800000000005s)]
*  who was the famous one that Tarantino told us about [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5506.0s)]
*  that had a bed in his office, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5509.0s)]
*  where he would bed starlets? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5511.36s)]
*  And this was like, back in the day [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5513.32s)]
*  in the early movie business. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5514.72s)]
*  I forget who it was. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5517.12s)]
*  Hitchcock? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5517.96s)]
*  No, I don't believe so. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5518.8s)]
*  I feel like he definitely. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5519.64s)]
*  But I'm sure it was a common practice. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5520.4800000000005s)]
*  I think all of those studio heads [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5523.280000000001s)]
*  and all those executives, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5524.68s)]
*  like Harvey Weinstein was just one of many. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5526.8s)]
*  That's how they did it. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5530.56s)]
*  Like you got jobs if you blew guys. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5532.160000000001s)]
*  And there was a lot of girls that were willing to do that. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5534.96s)]
*  And the real actresses would frown upon it [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5537.320000000001s)]
*  and they'd be mad, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5539.84s)]
*  but a lot of times they'd be boxed out. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5540.68s)]
*  And we heard those stories. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5542.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5543.360000000001s)]
*  I told you about that time [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5545.120000000001s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein came to the Comedy Store. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5545.96s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5548.72s)]
*  He came to the Comedy Store. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5549.56s)]
*  He came in the main room and I left. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5550.96s)]
*  The manager at the time called me [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5553.24s)]
*  and he's like, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5554.4800000000005s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein came to see you. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5555.32s)]
*  You need to come back here right now. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5556.16s)]
*  And the only reason I didn't go back [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5557.44s)]

*  It's pretty, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5606.72s)]
*  it's pretty expensive. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5608.360000000001s)]
*  It's pretty expensive from what I understand. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5610.2s)]
*  I mean, you do also have to campaign. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5612.24s)]
*  You have to go to these nursing homes [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5613.8s)]
*  because the voters are in nursing. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5615.8s)]

*  I think they've kind of, you know, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5618.24s)]
*  I mean, George Lopez is on the board now. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5619.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5638.08s)]

*  of the new special I did. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5645.92s)]
*  I'm probably gonna get in a bunch of trouble. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5647.52s)]
*  OnlyFansTV did let me yell about trans people [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5649.4s)]
*  for 30 minutes, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5651.4s)]
*  but now that Ellen Page is a trans man, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5652.24s)]
*  can she win an Oscar if she was emotional in a role? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5656.84s)]
*  Or is that cheating? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5662.4800000000005s)]
*  Huh. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5667.16s)]
*  Well, she's still a tiny man, you know? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5669.56s)]
*  So it's gonna be difficult for her to. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5673.56s)]
*  But if she can cry. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5674.96s)]
*  If she, he, whatever. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5675.8s)]

*  Is it cheating? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5680.16s)]
*  Is it cheating? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5681.0s)]
*  Is it like? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5681.84s)]
*  Depends on what hormones. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5682.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5683.6s)]

*  Okay. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5686.56s)]
*  So should we have to do that kind of testing [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5687.84s)]
*  the same way you would test an athlete [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5690.12s)]
*  who is about to compete against biological females? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5691.84s)]
*  You know, it's also interesting. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5695.56s)]
*  If you become a trans man, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5696.76s)]
*  you're allowed to be as manly as possible. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5699.280000000001s)]
*  And if you become a trans woman, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5701.96s)]
*  you're allowed to go full ho. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5703.6s)]

*  Of gender ideals. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5712.400000000001s)]

*  Like, you know women, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5721.6s)]
*  we don't have to dress like Betty Boop. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5722.84s)]
*  Like, why are you wearing cat ears? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5724.72s)]
*  They're trying so hard. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5726.84s)]
*  But I think it's also, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5728.24s)]
*  it's like if you're trying to make up for lost time, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5729.08s)]
*  it's like, okay, maybe you wanted to be a girl [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5730.5599999999995s)]
*  when you were like eight, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5733.88s)]
*  so you're dressing the way you, you know, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5734.72s)]
*  like in a princess costume. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5736.76s)]
*  Right, for 25 years you held it back. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5738.24s)]

*  to a woman in 2023, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5742.2s)]
*  you need to look like one of the boys from Stranger Things. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5743.44s)]
*  Like this is how we dress now. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5745.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5746.96s)]

*  Like what? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5754.84s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5755.68s)]
*  Like, you have to really like indicate it a little more. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5756.52s)]
*  The Elliot Page one, when he got fake abs, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5760.160000000001s)]

*  Because it's so crazy. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5787.26s)]
*  Because it would be like someone who only did sit-ups [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5788.240000000001s)]
*  with like a weighted vest on and dumbbells [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5791.4800000000005s)]

*  to develop a core like this. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5800.84s)]
*  And it's also no trans men transition to like a dad bod. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5801.92s)]
*  I guess. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5807.46s)]

*  They're hard as a rock. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5819.5199999999995s)]
*  Not hard as a rock, but it's like there's an implant, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5821.32s)]
*  like a titty implant that's under there [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5824.16s)]
*  that accentuates the area where you would have [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5826.32s)]
*  extraordinary abdominal muscles. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=5829.92s)]

*  Hunter Biden's. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6106.08s)]
*  It's Hunter's for sure. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6107.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6108.04s)]
*  The dude likes to party. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6109.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6110.68s)]
*  That's the only reason why nobody knows [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6112.28s)]
*  who's fucking cocaine it is. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6113.84s)]
*  How do you, that place has so many cameras. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6117.12s)]
*  You're telling me they can't figure out who dropped the baggie. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6121.08s)]
*  It's so true. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6124.48s)]
*  And if he was there, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6125.32s)]
*  he would give some to his dad [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6126.68s)]
*  so his dad can get through his speech. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6127.88s)]
*  Mocked for deleted tweets saying she ran for president. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6129.48s)]
*  So this is, this is the tweet. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6132.24s)]
*  So her tweet was, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6135.04s)]
*  investing in America means investing in all America. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6136.68s)]
*  When I ran for president, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6141.2s)]
*  I made a promise that I would leave [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6142.48s)]
*  no part of the country behind. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6143.92s)]
*  Like, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6145.48s)]
*  No. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6146.32s)]
*  So she's treating you as the president. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6147.76s)]
*  But now we know who writes that stuff. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6150.08s)]
*  No. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6151.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6152.76s)]
*  She mistakenly logged into her Twitter account [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6153.64s)]
*  instead of President Biden's to post the tweet. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6155.92s)]
*  All the people that are doing cocaine shouldn't be [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6158.56s)]
*  and all the people that aren't should be. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6160.96s)]
*  It seems like she could actually use some. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6162.72s)]
*  Oh, she's probably just, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6164.72s)]
*  I can't believe the job she signed up for. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6165.72s)]
*  Like you think you're gonna get the White House press [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6167.92s)]
*  secretary and then every day Biden's saying something [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6169.280000000001s)]
*  dumber. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6171.84s)]
*  There it is. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6172.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6173.96s)]
*  Every day Biden's saying something dumber [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6175.400000000001s)]
*  and then the press is grilling you on it [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6177.16s)]
*  and you have to explain it away. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6179.4400000000005s)]
*  I just don't understand why they can't [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6181.16s)]
*  put a little bronzer on this guy. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6183.72s)]
*  I mean. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6185.72s)]
*  There's nothing you could do. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6186.56s)]
*  He's, he's at the end. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6187.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's basically, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6188.96s)]
*  Joey Diaz said it best. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6190.2s)]
*  He goes, they already got the formaldehyde in them. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6191.52s)]
*  So, I have to be, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6193.72s)]
*  can we take a break? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6197.8s)]
*  I'm sure you do too. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6199.120000000001s)]
*  Oh please. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6199.96s)]
*  Pregnant lady would love to. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6200.8s)]
*  Biden being old? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6202.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6203.320000000001s)]
*  Why does our president look like a condominium [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6206.160000000001s)]
*  in Fort Lauderdale? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6209.68s)]
*  I just don't, I can't imagine that they think [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6210.52s)]
*  he's going to run in a year for president. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6212.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a year from now, November next year. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6216.360000000001s)]
*  Insane. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6218.320000000001s)]
*  He's going to run for four more years? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6219.5199999999995s)]
*  He's going to be the president for four more years? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6221.5599999999995s)]
*  Like how? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6223.36s)]
*  Did you see the clip where he said, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6224.2s)]
*  oh God, it was so racist by accident. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6225.88s)]
*  He was like, you know, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6228.88s)]
*  something about the difference between poor kids [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6231.5599999999995s)]
*  and white kids. Yeah, poor kids [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6233.32s)]
*  are just as smart as white kids. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6234.48s)]
*  Why did we not start the impeachment process [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6239.24s)]
*  right then and there? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6242.16s)]
*  Did you see where he said recently [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6243.0s)]
*  that he taught at University of Pennsylvania [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6244.2s)]
*  for four years? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6247.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6247.88s)]
*  Never taught a single class. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6249.360000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6250.2s)]
*  It is just, the guy, he looks like the Nutcracker. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6251.04s)]
*  Like the other countries are just like laughing at us, dude. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6254.2s)]
*  They must be so fun. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6256.76s)]
*  It must be so fun for them to watch us implode. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6257.88s)]
*  And if you, literally, if you are Russia, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6260.72s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen that Yuri Bezmanov video [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6262.68s)]
*  where he did, okay. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6265.360000000001s)]
*  You should see this. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6266.76s)]
*  We shouldn't play it because we played it on this podcast [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6267.88s)]
*  too many times, but I'll show it to you afterwards. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6269.76s)]
*  It's a former guy from the KGB [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6271.6s)]
*  who's explaining what they've done to America [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6275.12s)]
*  and how they've infiltrated their education systems [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6277.76s)]
*  and the demoralization of America [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6280.24s)]
*  and that this is a plan and it takes two generations. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6282.88s)]
*  And he's talking about, it's a 20 year plan. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6286.360000000001s)]
*  And he's talking about this in the 1980s. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6288.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6290.360000000001s)]
*  And that it's already been implemented. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6291.2s)]
*  It is too far gone. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6292.4400000000005s)]
*  You will not stop this process. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6294.0s)]
*  This process, this demoralization of your country [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6296.56s)]
*  will be complete. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6300.52s)]
*  And it starts with teaching Marxist Leninist ideas [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6302.320000000001s)]
*  in colleges. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6305.52s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6306.56s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6307.96s)]
*  It's wild because if this guy was just guessing in 1984 [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6309.12s)]
*  and it's not really a long term Soviet strategy [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6314.12s)]
*  to destroy America, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6317.719999999999s)]
*  that has been super duper successful. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6319.24s)]
*  I mean, feels like there's, I don't know, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6322.5199999999995s)]
*  RFK Jr., but I'm not weighing in on the science part of it. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6326.679999999999s)]
*  I just feel like if we had someone being like, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6330.24s)]
*  we're coming for you. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6332.08s)]
*  I mean, his voice alone, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6333.04s)]
*  it's like, I think everyone would be like, damn. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6334.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not fucking around in America. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6337.68s)]
*  Well, I think other countries biggest fear [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6339.0s)]
*  would be Trump getting back in power. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6341.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6343.6s)]
*  Because he's the one guy that is, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6344.44s)]
*  even though he's a business insider, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6347.24s)]
*  he's a billionaire and all that good stuff, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6350.68s)]
*  but he's not a political insider. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6352.32s)]
*  And he does not work well with those people. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6354.76s)]
*  And he wants to do things his way. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6356.76s)]
*  And I just think he's a much more formidable adversary [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6358.64s)]
*  for these countries. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6364.2s)]
*  He doesn't fuck around with them. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6365.04s)]
*  But he also will make deals with them too. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6367.72s)]
*  It's kind of crazy how he was, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6369.72s)]
*  no one gave him credit for saying the, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6372.08s)]
*  literally the most logical thing [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6374.24s)]
*  when he was talking to CNN's Caitlin, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6375.96s)]
*  whatever her name is. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6378.400000000001s)]
*  I forget the woman's name, sorry. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6379.96s)]
*  But he was talking to her and she said, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6382.04s)]
*  do you want Ukraine to win this war? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6384.0s)]
*  He goes, I want people to stop dying. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6385.36s)]
*  No one else would say that. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6388.400000000001s)]
*  Well, that seems like the most logical thing to say. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6389.64s)]
*  Like, let's stop, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6392.4800000000005s)]
*  figure out how to get people to stop dying. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6393.72s)]
*  Of course, it's a horrible war. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6397.400000000001s)]
*  You got people that were literally a part of the same union [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6399.240000000001s)]
*  and now they're blowing each other up. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6401.4800000000005s)]
*  I think we're getting to a point [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6403.88s)]
*  where people just want to see someone be fearless. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6404.72s)]
*  It's like the same person who's like Rosie O'Donnell's fat. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6406.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, is she not? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6408.6s)]
*  Is she not? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6410.08s)]
*  I mean, it's funny, but it's also like, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6411.280000000001s)]
*  it just boils down to, yeah, this guy will say the truth. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6412.92s)]
*  What happened with, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6415.76s)]
*  did Rosie talk shit about him or something like that? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6416.6s)]
*  Is that what started that feud? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6419.160000000001s)]
*  I don't really know. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6420.0s)]
*  Well, I think, look, we forget that he was [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6420.84s)]
*  the biggest TV star before he was the president. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6422.76s)]
*  So I think he maybe knew her from that [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6425.839999999999s)]
*  and he called her fat. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6427.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, remember when we... [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6429.2s)]
*  But people just, it boils down to like, yeah, she is. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6430.959999999999s)]
*  He's fat too. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6433.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6434.639999999999s)]
*  Rosie, are you not? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6435.48s)]
*  Like, I don't know, tell you. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6436.32s)]
*  Like, so he's just saying the truth. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6437.16s)]
*  And I think that it's like people are trying so hard [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6438.959999999999s)]
*  just to get reelected instead of just tell the truth [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6440.919999999999s)]
*  and serve their country. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6443.36s)]
*  And it's so obvious and transparent. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6444.2s)]
*  And it's like the more, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6445.719999999999s)]
*  it's like when that woman, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6446.639999999999s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll came forward against him [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6447.48s)]
*  for like sexual harassment. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6449.24s)]
*  And he was like, look at her, you think I'd harass her? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6450.4s)]
*  I mean, just like, the guy's unstoppable. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6452.32s)]
*  That lady's a nutty lady. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6455.04s)]
*  You ever seen that lady get interviewed? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6456.36s)]
*  No. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6458.04s)]
*  Yeah, they try to keep her away from the cameras. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6458.88s)]
*  Oh boy, she's like an advice columnist or something. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6460.96s)]
*  I don't even know what she is. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6463.6s)]
*  She's a journalist. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6464.44s)]
*  But she's eccentric. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6465.6s)]
*  We're at the point where we're like, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6467.6s)]
*  yeah, we're at war, you guys. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6468.56s)]
*  We need someone who's just gonna like say the truth. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6470.56s)]
*  Well, also like, what are our options? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6472.72s)]
*  You know, what are the options? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6475.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6477.0s)]
*  The whole thing is just so scrambled. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6477.84s)]
*  It's a scary time. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6480.04s)]
*  It's weird because it's just, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6481.32s)]
*  it shows you the thing that you've already known, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6483.64s)]
*  but you didn't want to admit, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6486.04s)]
*  that this system is not run logically [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6487.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's not run by someone who's like some [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6490.0s)]
*  evolved, experienced person who's, you know, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6493.160000000001s)]
*  got a real grip on how to run this system. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6497.120000000001s)]
*  Like, there's no one like that. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6500.120000000001s)]
*  They don't exist. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6501.4400000000005s)]
*  So you just have these special interest groups [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6502.280000000001s)]
*  that are forcing things to get done [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6504.4800000000005s)]
*  that shouldn't get done and money getting jotted down. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6506.04s)]
*  You see the Zelensky the other day just asked for credit? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6508.4400000000005s)]
*  He was like, if you won't give us any more money, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6511.92s)]
*  please give us credits. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6513.88s)]
*  Like credits. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6515.36s)]
*  Credit, so they can buy more weapons and shit. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6516.2s)]
*  If you aren't gonna give us money, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6519.400000000001s)]
*  give us credit and we'll pay you back. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6521.2s)]
*  It just seems kind of wild that we're sending [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6522.4800000000005s)]
*  all this money all over the world, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6523.88s)]
*  not that they don't need help, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6525.24s)]
*  but it's like, what about people in America? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6527.08s)]
*  What about Hawaii? [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6528.92s)]
*  What about Hawaii? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6529.96s)]
*  We just forgot about Hawaii or? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6530.8s)]
*  Yeah, they accidentally spent an extra $6 billion [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6532.16s)]
*  on Ukraine, they sent an accidental $6 billion, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6537.12s)]
*  which would be more than enough to replace [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6540.8s)]
*  every single home that burned in Maui. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6543.12s)]
*  And there was no consideration for doing that at all. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6545.8s)]
*  And we don't have clean water in Appalachia or Flint? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6548.360000000001s)]
*  Do we have, we've solved that yet? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6550.4400000000005s)]

*  Okay, all right. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6553.360000000001s)]
*  And then everywhere else it has water as fluoride in it. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6554.84s)]
*  Explain that. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6558.08s)]
*  Which that was, didn't the Surgeon General [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6559.28s)]
*  do that in the 50s? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6561.88s)]
*  Like, wasn't that something that was done [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6563.0s)]
*  by the Surgeon General? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6564.56s)]
*  I would check his fucking stock market portfolio. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6565.400000000001s)]
*  And was the idea of that to help with dental stuff? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6568.64s)]
*  Gary Brecker was talking about on the podcast yesterday. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6572.12s)]

*  Yeah, he's great. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6575.12s)]
*  He said there's some evidence that it's a thin layer [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6576.0s)]
*  of protection that it can give you, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6579.4400000000005s)]
*  but also brush your fucking teeth. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6580.92s)]
*  But also wouldn't. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6582.4400000000005s)]

*  He's literally drinking poison water. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6682.04s)]
*  Like they're drinking poison water [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6683.8s)]
*  and everyone's cheering that he's asking for poison water. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6685.24s)]
*  Because they're excited he's about to fall over and die. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6687.679999999999s)]
*  No, they're thinking, you know, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6689.679999999999s)]
*  he's showing us that he's going to fix it. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6690.96s)]
*  I mean... [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6693.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, you know that's Fiji. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6699.32s)]
*  They poured the fucking... [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6700.8s)]
*  Right now they're like, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6701.84s)]
*  they just ran to the grocery store in this amount of time. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6702.679999999999s)]
*  Now the reason I know I'm okay [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6705.639999999999s)]
*  is because I already had some plenty of water. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6707.72s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6711.24s)]
*  What? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6712.08s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6712.92s)]
*  Like he's doing a shot of Red Bull. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6714.0s)]
*  This is spooky. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6716.04s)]
*  I really didn't need a glass of water. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6718.68s)]
*  This is not a stunt. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6720.08s)]
*  Usually when something isn't a stunt, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6721.92s)]
*  you have to say that. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6723.2s)]
*  It's 100% a stunt. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6724.04s)]
*  When was the last time a president stopped a speech to ask, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6724.88s)]
*  can I get a glass of water? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6727.24s)]
*  They would never do that. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6729.76s)]
*  They would have water ready for him. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6730.6s)]
*  If you do stand up, how often have you said, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6732.44s)]
*  can I get a glass of water? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6735.04s)]
*  Not often. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6736.28s)]
*  Like no, you bring a fucking water on stage with you. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6737.12s)]
*  And then what happened? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6738.68s)]
*  It still hasn't been handled. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6739.52s)]
*  See, this is a drink. Gross. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6742.64s)]
*  Gross. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6744.72s)]
*  I mean, did it even get in his mouth? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6746.76s)]
*  I mean, it's Appalachia water still from Purdue, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6748.360000000001s)]
*  poisoning the water. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6753.280000000001s)]
*  Like a lot of people that I went to high school with [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6754.12s)]
*  and stuff, they have thyroid cancer, 40. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6756.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6758.84s)]
*  Yeah, from DuPont. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6759.68s)]
*  I mean, so many chemicals have been thrown into Appalachia, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6760.84s)]
*  but West Virginia water, DuPont, put in all that. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6763.400000000001s)]
*  Remember there's that Dark Water? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6766.320000000001s)]
*  There's a movie with Mark Ruffalo, great movie. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6767.76s)]
*  He did it again. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6769.400000000001s)]
*  Here's another one. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6770.24s)]
*  Watch how he did it this time. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6771.08s)]
*  Watch, watch how he gets it up to his mouth. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6772.16s)]
*  Generally, I have not been doing stunts here, but you know. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6774.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6777.4s)]
*  And this used a filter. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6779.88s)]
*  The water around this table was plant water that was filtered. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6785.32s)]
*  But he didn't drink it. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6791.0s)]
*  He did instantly start stuttering [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6792.12s)]
*  after he had a tiny bit of it. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6793.599999999999s)]
*  So his eyes start blinking. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6795.28s)]
*  Instant neurological damage. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6796.8s)]
*  So what was the Purdue thing? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6799.400000000001s)]
*  Was it something to do with the... [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6800.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, DuPont. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6801.4800000000005s)]
*  DuPont. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6802.320000000001s)]
*  Sorry, DuPont. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6803.160000000001s)]
*  It was Teflon. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6804.0s)]
*  So the movie Dark Water covered it, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6805.04s)]
*  but it was actually, RFK worked on this case [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6809.04s)]
*  back when he was a lawyer. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6811.6s)]
*  Because you know, RFK spent so much time [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6812.92s)]
*  trying to clean up water, which I really admired. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6814.320000000001s)]
*  But what Teflon was made of, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6816.76s)]
*  they ended up just pouring into the... [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6819.72s)]
*  Dark Waters. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6821.76s)]
*  I never watched this. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6822.6s)]
*  Who's in this? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6824.4400000000005s)]
*  Amazing, Mark Ruffalo. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6825.280000000001s)]
*  Timberlake. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6826.64s)]
*  Mark Ruffalo. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6827.48s)]
*  Tim Robbins. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6828.5599999999995s)]
*  Tim Robbins. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6829.4s)]
*  Pan Hathaway. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6830.879999999999s)]
*  And it's all about... [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6833.12s)]
*  And it's all about the poisoning of the water in Appalachia. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6833.959999999999s)]
*  He's a lawyer. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6838.04s)]
*  And the lawyer who took on the case for free [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6839.32s)]
*  to try to take on DuPont. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6841.879999999999s)]
*  I mean... [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6844.879999999999s)]
*  That looks like John Reeves, doesn't he? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6845.719999999999s)]
*  We've got a shorter version of John Reeves. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6846.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6849.759999999999s)]
*  Disgusting. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6850.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's really... [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6851.44s)]
*  Well, they've been doing that from the beginning of time. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6852.259999999999s)]
*  You know, and then when they're not doing it here, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6853.719999999999s)]
*  they do it in South America. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6855.08s)]
*  And then what they're doing, I mean, in Appalachia [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6857.0s)]
*  with the coal mines and all the pollution from that [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6858.400000000001s)]
*  is really incorrigible. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6860.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's all crazy. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6861.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty wild. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6863.12s)]
*  Well, we were looking at this video [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6863.96s)]
*  of this one town in Indiana [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6865.92s)]
*  where they have multiple coal mines in the area. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6868.4400000000005s)]
*  And you go outside and these people have like a thin layer [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6870.88s)]
*  of soot that's on their windshield. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6873.2s)]
*  And you just wipe it off with your finger. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6875.16s)]
*  And so like you're breathing that. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6876.64s)]
*  It's going to the kids' lungs, yeah. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6877.88s)]
*  Everybody, a host of different sort of [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6879.6s)]
*  cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases these people have. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6881.4800000000005s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6887.2s)]
*  I mean, it's so heartbreaking. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6888.04s)]
*  And I mean, I guess I don't know enough about the topic, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6889.4800000000005s)]
*  but you know, there's this great documentary [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6891.68s)]
*  called Hillbilly about the moment Hillary [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6893.4400000000005s)]
*  really put her foot in her mouth calling for clean energy. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6897.28s)]
*  And she said, it was not the deplorable speech, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6899.88s)]
*  but she said, we're going to get rid of coal mining. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6902.64s)]
*  You guys did the best you could to keep the lights on. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6906.32s)]
*  What? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6910.0s)]
*  And by best they could, they died. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6911.2s)]
*  Like I have a grandfather worked in coal. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6913.04s)]
*  And what Massey coal and Sinclair coal, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6916.16s)]
*  what they did to that region is so despicable. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6918.639999999999s)]
*  Cause number one, they wouldn't allow for no unionizing. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6920.84s)]
*  And it's a great place to union bust [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6924.96s)]
*  because people live so far apart. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6926.5199999999995s)]
*  They would isolate the Italians from the Irish, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6927.96s)]
*  from the blacks so that nobody would collude and unionize. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6930.44s)]
*  But they would pay the coal miners in vouchers [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6933.84s)]
*  to the Sinclair oil store so that they could never [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6936.68s)]
*  build any kind of wealth. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6938.72s)]
*  They built the schools. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6940.16s)]
*  I mean, they own everything. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6941.32s)]
*  You know, and it's a great documentary [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6943.52s)]
*  about how Trump put on a hard hat. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6946.04s)]
*  He went to West Virginia and said, [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6949.08s)]
*  I'm never going to get rid of coal [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6950.88s)]
*  because I'm not going to get rid of your jobs. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6952.320000000001s)]
*  And even though there's only 50,000 left, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6953.6s)]
*  it's like one of the most valuable in terms of like voting [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6955.4800000000005s)]
*  areas of the country that people just ignore. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6958.360000000001s)]
*  People just never go there. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6960.320000000001s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6962.400000000001s)]
*  But that's also centered the opioid crisis. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6963.16s)]
*  So it's coal, it's Teflon, it's poisoning water, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6964.96s)]
*  and then opioid crisis. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6968.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's spots in this country [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6971.16s)]
*  where you can get a bad roll of the dice [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6972.64s)]
*  to be born in the fucking Hillbilly [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6974.320000000001s)]
*  commune in West Virginia. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6976.64s)]
*  And like, fuck. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6978.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6979.76s)]
*  That's right. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6980.8s)]
*  And there's a lot of like, you know, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6981.12s)]
*  and the fact that it's thought of as this backwards area [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6982.4800000000005s)]
*  always breaks my heart because it was the first like woke [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6984.52s)]
*  state. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6986.68s)]
*  It was the first state that said, we're not doing slavery. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6987.320000000001s)]
*  Said, we're not doing slavery. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6990.280000000001s)]
*  John Brown left and said, we're not playing this shit. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6991.76s)]
*  And now it's. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6995.08s)]
*  So were they just a symptom, a victim of the fact [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6995.6s)]
*  that they had coal? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6997.88s)]
*  Coal, yeah. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6998.8s)]
*  Came in being exploited, which is, you know, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=6999.68s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this is exactly true or not. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7001.16s)]
*  But people I know that are in the coal business there [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7003.2s)]
*  is like, you know, they've taken all [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7005.24s)]
*  of our natural resources. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7006.32s)]
*  If they hadn't mined all of our coal, like by now, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7007.44s)]
*  we would have diamonds. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7009.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, like they've taken all the wealth of the region. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7010.88s)]
*  And it's just it's totally devastating what [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7013.2s)]
*  it's done to the topography. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7016.12s)]
*  I mean, the trailers, the boulders crush kids all the time [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7017.36s)]
*  because of the way that they've messed with the topography [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7022.08s)]
*  and completely just depleted the soil. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7024.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, so they'll have collapses and shit. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7026.44s)]
*  Floods, horrible floods. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7028.68s)]
*  Dude, imagine being in one of those things when it collapses. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7030.48s)]
*  Can't can't can't probably be in that little Titanic [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7033.599999999999s)]
*  easy bake oven. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7038.0s)]
*  There's one place that has coal mines that [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7039.36s)]
*  has a fire that's been burning inside that coal [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7042.5599999999995s)]
*  mine for like decades. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7045.959999999999s)]
*  Wow, that makes sense. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7047.24s)]
*  I mean, the fact that that I think about this all the time [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7049.0s)]
*  because I don't know where you are on like ancestral trauma [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7052.24s)]
*  and epigenetic imprinting and stuff. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7055.08s)]
*  But I've always had a little bit of a like, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7056.599999999999s)]
*  I don't like small spaces, you know. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7058.28s)]
*  And my grandfather was in mines and sometimes [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7059.96s)]
*  that imprints on you. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7061.92s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7063.36s)]
*  Original cause and start date still a matter of debate. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7064.32s)]
*  It is burning at depths up to 300 feet over an eight mile [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7066.64s)]
*  stretch of three thousand seven hundred acres. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7070.56s)]
*  At its current rate, it could continue to burn for over 250 [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7073.52s)]
*  years. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7077.36s)]
*  Due to the fire in the 1980s, Centralia was mostly abandoned. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7078.28s)]
*  Can you imagine going a mile into the earth? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7083.96s)]
*  See if you can find a video of that [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7087.92s)]
*  because there's videos of it. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7089.4s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7090.44s)]
*  So this coal mine fire has been going on forever. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7093.96s)]
*  It burns underneath the ground and it's all coal. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7097.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's never going out. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7099.92s)]
*  And there's oxygen to it. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7101.12s)]
*  So it's never going out since 1971. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7102.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7105.12s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7105.92s)]
*  Dude. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7107.4s)]
*  I mean, it says it's been burning since 62. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7109.32s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7112.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7115.839999999999s)]
*  That's unfathomable. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7116.64s)]
*  It's just coming out of the ground everywhere. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7119.400000000001s)]
*  Imagine you're driving through and there's no one there. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7121.6s)]
*  That's some walking dead shit. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7123.76s)]
*  Can't. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7125.68s)]
*  Too scary. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7126.6s)]
*  Also, how bad does that air suck? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7127.320000000001s)]
*  That's the thing about the coal mining thing. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7131.64s)]
*  It's like what you really need to do [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7133.4400000000005s)]
*  is find under other industries. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7134.92s)]
*  Yeah, without taking coal miners jobs [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7137.76s)]
*  because it's like it's this thing where [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7139.68s)]
*  they have this skill and then all of a sudden it's like, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7141.04s)]
*  we're going to get rid of your job. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7143.200000000001s)]
*  Well, I remember Learn to Code. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7145.0s)]
*  That was the thing. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7147.28s)]
*  They were telling them Learn to Code. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7148.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7149.52s)]
*  Like what? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7150.48s)]
*  Learn to code the robots that are going to replace you? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7150.96s)]
*  Learn to get something that's going to give you a job [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7153.96s)]
*  is what the idea was. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7156.2s)]
*  But it's like, fuck, what are you saying? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7157.16s)]
*  It must be wild. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7159.04s)]
*  Like you're going to send kids to college soon. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7159.88s)]
*  Like is that a weird, I mean college, like. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7161.92s)]
*  You know, I had this conversation with someone [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7165.36s)]
*  the other day where they were like, you know, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7167.28s)]
*  kids today have it harder. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7169.6s)]
*  I'm like, bro, kids were born before there were floors. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7170.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7174.08s)]
*  You know, there was no, they hadn't invented floors yet [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7174.68s)]
*  and people were having kids. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7177.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7178.76s)]
*  It's complicated for sure. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7179.36s)]
*  It has always been complicated. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7181.12s)]
*  Every single time human beings have been alive, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7182.8s)]
*  it's been complicated. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7185.24s)]
*  These are different complications [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7186.5599999999995s)]
*  that our kids are dealing with than we dealt with. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7187.94s)]
*  But. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7191.16s)]
*  And every generation has probably said that, right? [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7191.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7193.48s)]
*  This is the hardest generation for kids. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7193.76s)]
*  Or the weirdest. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7195.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7195.92s)]
*  Like the 80s are probably weird compared to the 70s. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7196.08s)]
*  And those were. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7198.6s)]
*  So kids used to work in factories. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7198.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7200.64s)]
*  That's the other part of that dissolving illusions [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7201.68s)]
*  I'm still do. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7203.92s)]
*  Burning Mountain is a rare phenomenon. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7205.08s)]
*  A coal seam buried 30 meters underground, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7206.88s)]
*  which has been burning for at least five thousand five [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7209.4800000000005s)]
*  hundred years. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7212.16s)]
*  And some say over fifteen thousand years. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7212.96s)]
*  Where is that? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7215.320000000001s)]
*  It's in Australia. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7216.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7217.04s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7217.68s)]
*  So is that how we found fire? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7219.280000000001s)]
*  Did we just stumble across it? [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7221.96s)]
*  I think it was like, did we really come up with it? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7223.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it was lightning. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7227.04s)]
*  I think that's what the current belief is that originally [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7228.88s)]
*  they carried fire from one place to another. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7233.2s)]
*  You know, they would get the coals and they would figure out [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7236.16s)]
*  how to maintain it because it was so precious when it happened. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7238.48s)]
*  And they figured out how to keep fires lit. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7241.28s)]
*  Huh. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7243.72s)]
*  But if you have a fire pit somewhere like a water pit [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7244.2s)]
*  that you're used to going to get water from. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7246.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7248.2s)]
*  And you just go walk and get more fire when you're out of fire. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7248.68s)]
*  You don't need to worry about making it because they have it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7250.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7252.88s)]
*  Were there brush fires back then? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7253.2s)]
*  The way they are now. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7254.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7255.4s)]
*  I'm thinking of it as a super baseline. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7256.12s)]
*  Like, we don't know what fire is, but it's over there. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7258.24s)]
*  So we can just go get more of it. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7260.96s)]
*  Well, I think for sure when they first found fire, they said, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7262.72s)]
*  you know, it's kind of nice to get close to this. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7265.92s)]
*  It's kind of warm over here. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7268.12s)]
*  And then they probably figured out, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7268.96s)]
*  well, you just put more wood on it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7270.84s)]
*  You can make it more fire. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7272.52s)]
*  And then they figured you could pick up the part that's not on fire [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7275.6s)]
*  and take it over here and now you can have fire over here. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7278.200000000001s)]
*  You can throw your enemy on it. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7279.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7280.72s)]
*  How do you make one of those things? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7280.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7282.240000000001s)]
*  Like, then someone figured out, you know what? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7282.52s)]
*  Friction makes fires. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7284.240000000001s)]
*  And then the first dude to figure out how to do this. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7285.84s)]
*  That's was Haddo Seedies. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7288.240000000001s)]
*  Have you ever done that? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7290.84s)]
*  Schizophrenic. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7291.48s)]
*  Made a fire, like in Girl Scouts or something. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7292.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I did in the Boy Scouts. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7294.719999999999s)]
*  It takes forever. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7295.759999999999s)]
*  And I don't think I ever really got a fire. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7297.639999999999s)]
*  I think I got to where it was blackened from the friction. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7299.44s)]
*  It got a little bit red, but I never really made a fire. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7303.2s)]
*  I wonder if they teach now in Girl and Boy Scouts, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7305.719999999999s)]
*  just using the mirror and the sun. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7307.959999999999s)]
*  Doesn't that? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7309.639999999999s)]
*  I once had my couch. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7310.12s)]
*  There was like a CD. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7312.32s)]
*  Or remember the old school CDs? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7313.5599999999995s)]
*  And it made the sun hit it and it burnt my couch. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7315.36s)]
*  Do you know that that's the way that some people sabotage [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7318.16s)]
*  fields and start wildfires? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7321.2s)]
*  They set up magnifying glasses at an angle, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7323.5199999999995s)]
*  and then they just leave the space. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7326.8s)]
*  Like they're competitors or something? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7328.32s)]
*  Well, I don't know why and who, but I [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7329.88s)]
*  know that they have found magnifying glasses set up [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7331.4s)]
*  outside, where people have decided [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7334.16s)]
*  that the sun's going to hit here, it's going to burn this. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7337.5199999999995s)]
*  And they can just set it there at night and leave. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7340.8s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7343.08s)]
*  Yeah, and it works. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7344.28s)]
*  That really works. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7346.24s)]
*  That works. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7347.32s)]
*  I did a lot of that as a kid. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7348.12s)]
*  We lit paper on fire and shit with magnifying glasses. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7349.36s)]
*  It's kind of nuts. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7351.92s)]
*  I mean, I guess kids were always doing dumb shit. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7352.92s)]
*  Now they're just filming it, huh? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7354.84s)]
*  Always. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7356.92s)]
*  But that's a pretty wild one, that you [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7357.639999999999s)]
*  could take a magnifying glass and start a fire pretty quickly. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7359.719999999999s)]
*  You can kill an ant. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7363.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when we were kids, we would [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7364.719999999999s)]
*  try to kill bugs and shit. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7365.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, how wild is that? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7367.16s)]
*  We were monsters. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7368.32s)]
*  I mean, people say like kids now, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7369.16s)]
*  they leave negative comments and da-da-da. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7370.48s)]
*  I'm like, we used to take shovels [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7372.48s)]
*  and knock over mailboxes. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7374.36s)]
*  People used to play baseball with frogs. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7376.48s)]
*  God, we used to toilet paper people's homes. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7379.12s)]
*  We used to throw eggs at people's cars. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7381.4s)]
*  Now you get destroyed emotionally for maybe a couple [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7385.12s)]
*  minutes because you feel left out [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7387.639999999999s)]
*  or you got a negative comment. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7389.04s)]
*  We used to destroy property. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7389.76s)]
*  Kids used to take rocks and put them in the middle of snowballs [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7391.16s)]
*  and then throw them at cars. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7394.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7396.8s)]
*  That's brutal. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7397.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7398.24s)]
*  You'd always hear cars hit the brakes. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7399.12s)]
*  You motherfuckers. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7400.84s)]
*  I mean, why did we do that? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7402.16s)]
*  We would take a shovel, drive by a mailbox, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7403.72s)]
*  and just level it. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7406.16s)]
*  Because you could. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7407.0s)]
*  Because it's there. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7407.76s)]
*  Psychotic. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7408.4s)]
*  You ever go to a small town and you see bullet holes [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7409.2s)]
*  in the stop signs? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7411.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7412.92s)]
*  That's what that is. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7413.44s)]
*  Fuck yeah, bang. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7415.04s)]
*  I mean, now it's just filmed, I guess. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7417.599999999999s)]
*  I guess that's the new Darwinism is are you [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7420.28s)]
*  going to film yourself doing it. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7422.28s)]
*  Well, how about those kids that film themselves riding over [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7423.599999999999s)]
*  that former police chief in Vegas? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7426.16s)]
*  I haven't seen this, but I did see a couple people die [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7429.0s)]
*  doing a TikTok challenge, doing a backflip off of a boat. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7431.48s)]
*  Something like over 400 people have died so far taking selfies. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7436.76s)]
*  Oh, at least. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7439.96s)]
*  At least. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7441.48s)]
*  How many people have fallen off mountains? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7442.2s)]
*  Just backing up. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7444.68s)]
*  That shit always happens. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7445.48s)]
*  So what happens is it because you're so [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7447.28s)]
*  focused on getting the photo. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7449.44s)]
*  I mean, there's a video of, I think it's in India, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7451.16s)]
*  a guy taking a video of himself next to a wild bear [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7453.2s)]
*  as the bear eats him. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7456.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, god. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7457.8s)]
*  And he's not, everyone else is filming it, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7458.8s)]
*  but he just keeps filming as he gets eaten. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7461.12s)]
*  Yeah, people are, if nothing's happened to you, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7463.48s)]
*  you don't think it's going to happen to you? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7466.08s)]
*  And you have this. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7468.4s)]
*  It shuts off your frontal lobe. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7469.08s)]
*  That means it's truly a drug. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7470.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7471.84s)]
*  Is this the guy? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7472.32s)]
*  Is he taking a selfie? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7473.16s)]
*  Oh, god. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7474.76s)]
*  I think it's, yeah, it starts with him taking the video [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7475.32s)]
*  and just, oh. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7477.6s)]
*  Oh, god. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7479.2s)]
*  And that bear is just like, well, you're meat. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7480.32s)]
*  You're made out of meat. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7482.8s)]
*  I'm fucking hungry. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7483.76s)]
*  Oh, god. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7484.76s)]
*  I don't think he survives this, right? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7486.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7489.08s)]
*  Yeah, probably not. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7489.92s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7490.76s)]
*  Oh, god, that fucked up my algorithm for a while. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7492.8s)]
*  But wait, what is the one that the person died? [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7494.68s)]
*  No. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7497.64s)]
*  The Vegas thing that the two kids. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7499.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, these two kids were driving in a car, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7500.56s)]
*  and he was on a bike, and they fucking plow into him. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7503.52s)]
*  And they're laughing about it. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7506.64s)]
*  And they filmed it and livestreamed it. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7508.4800000000005s)]
*  They hit one car, hit and run, and they hit this guy [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7511.400000000001s)]
*  and killed him. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7513.72s)]
*  And it was initially reported. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7514.96s)]
*  A lot of people tried to say that they're [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7516.400000000001s)]
*  trying to downplay crime, because it was initially reported [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7519.16s)]
*  that he just died from hit and run. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7521.6s)]
*  And they were like, they don't even [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7523.88s)]
*  want to say why he really died. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7525.08s)]
*  No, they didn't know why he really died. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7526.2s)]
*  It took like two weeks before they figured out [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7527.4400000000005s)]
*  these kids killed him. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7529.4400000000005s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7530.8s)]
*  Yeah, and no remorse. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7531.6s)]
*  They're laughing in court. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7534.04s)]
*  They're giving people the finger in court. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7535.24s)]
*  Is this like psychopathy? [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7538.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's psychopathy, but it's also street cred. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7541.08s)]
*  They're trying to pretend they're hard. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7543.28s)]
*  And then you go, has this always happened? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7545.64s)]
*  We just didn't see videos of it. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7547.24s)]
*  We've always done savage shit. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7549.56s)]
*  Well, for sure, there's always been gang bangers [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7551.4800000000005s)]
*  and gang bang initiations. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7553.8s)]
*  And people have always done fucked up things. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7555.68s)]
*  It's just always been a part of human culture. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7558.56s)]
*  But it's just seeing young kids run over an old guy [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7560.4400000000005s)]
*  on a bicycle is particularly fucking disturbing. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7564.0s)]
*  I wonder, though, do you think that having all these videos [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7566.4400000000005s)]
*  available desensitizes? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7568.84s)]
*  100%. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7570.6s)]
*  Wow. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7571.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think 100%. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7572.28s)]
*  I think there's a bunch of factors [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7573.2s)]
*  that desensitize people. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7574.6s)]
*  I think movies, violent movies. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7575.72s)]
*  And this is not a judgment. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7577.8s)]
*  I'm not saying we shouldn't have violent movies [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7579.56s)]
*  or we shouldn't have violent video games. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7581.56s)]
*  But if you don't think it's affecting people, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7583.0s)]
*  of course it is. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7584.72s)]
*  You're being so much, you're so accustomed to seeing violence [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7586.08s)]
*  and wild, horrific violence. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7590.2s)]
*  I really try to not watch too much news [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7593.44s)]
*  or read too much news because it spooks me [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7595.6s)]
*  how I can just scroll past a school shooting, which [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7597.36s)]
*  is like, bup, bup. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7599.96s)]
*  I'm like, I remember Newtown happened. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7601.16s)]
*  I was at a job where we sent everyone home. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7603.68s)]
*  We sent everyone home when that happened. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7606.88s)]
*  You know, it was like I cried. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7608.68s)]
*  Now everybody would be like, oh no. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7611.04s)]
*  Another one. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7612.92s)]
*  I'm worried about my brain that I could just [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7614.160000000001s)]
*  scroll right past that. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7615.64s)]
*  We should be. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7617.0s)]
*  It's a factor. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7618.72s)]
*  There's something going on. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7620.360000000001s)]
*  There's something going on with us with this prolonged exposure [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7621.96s)]
*  to horrific things. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7625.240000000001s)]
*  Sagura and I have this text message chain [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7626.84s)]
*  where every day we send each other the worst [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7628.8s)]
*  things that we find. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7630.64s)]
*  It's almost like we're waiting for someone to cry uncle. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7634.4800000000005s)]
*  We do it every day. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7637.360000000001s)]
*  Every day we send each other the, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7638.4400000000005s)]
*  I always tell him when he's taking a shit [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7641.12s)]
*  because it gets up at like two o'clock in the morning. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7642.56s)]
*  It's some horrible car accident, some horrible animal attack. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7645.12s)]
*  Remember when there used to be one video [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7650.36s)]
*  every couple months that would be like the one, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7653.16s)]
*  remember two girls, one cup? [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7654.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7656.04s)]
*  That was like. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7656.88s)]
*  And that was fake. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7657.72s)]
*  That was like ice cream in your butt. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7658.56s)]
*  It was like ice cream or something. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7659.4s)]
*  Whipped cream or something. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7660.72s)]
*  I remember when that happened. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7661.84s)]
*  It was like everybody had seen it. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7663.16s)]
*  Now that's just kind of. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7664.6s)]
*  Now it's nothing. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7666.04s)]
*  When you realize how extreme that seemed at the time. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7666.88s)]
*  I know. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7670.04s)]
*  That was a big deal. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7671.8s)]
*  There was a reaction. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7672.64s)]
*  The two girls, one cup reaction video. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7673.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7675.16s)]
*  You watch people watching it. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7676.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7677.2s)]
*  But now you see 10 times worse than that on a daily. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7678.04s)]
*  If you have my algorithm, my algorithm's a mess. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7682.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to clean it. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7686.08s)]
*  Do you think it's part of your brain? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7687.0s)]
*  Because it's like, what is it, rubber necking? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7688.76s)]
*  Is it kind of the same thing in the brain [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7691.64s)]
*  where you see it accidents? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7693.08s)]
*  You're trying to study it. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7694.24s)]
*  There's also, you can't believe you're really seeing it. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7695.64s)]
*  The hit and run that I saw yesterday was like whoa. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7698.2s)]
*  That's wild you saw that. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7701.56s)]
*  Dude, I saw it as far from here as the door [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7702.400000000001s)]
*  to this studio is. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7705.12s)]
*  It was two car lengths away. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7707.76s)]
*  They say that when Fast and Furious movies come out, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7709.0s)]
*  car accidents go up. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7711.04s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7712.12s)]
*  Right? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7712.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7713.8s)]
*  The type of people that are pumped [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7714.64s)]
*  that are Fast and Furious movies out, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7715.84s)]
*  they shouldn't be allowed to drive. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7717.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7718.360000000001s)]
*  But we. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7719.2s)]
*  There's always so much more drag racing when that happens. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7720.04s)]
*  But I feel like. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7724.400000000001s)]
*  Street takeovers. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7725.240000000001s)]
*  I do feel like that's probably always happened. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7726.320000000001s)]
*  But also it's like, you know, people, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7728.4s)]
*  I mean in Rome people would just go to the Colosseum [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7730.759999999999s)]
*  to see people get torn apart. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7732.96s)]
*  We used to go to the town square [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7734.24s)]
*  and watch people get hanged for entertainment. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7735.44s)]
*  I mean this is in us. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7737.0s)]
*  And also there's something that we're aware [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7738.679999999999s)]
*  that we're very, very vulnerable. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7741.28s)]
*  So if we can watch something happen to someone [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7743.24s)]
*  that exposes that vulnerability, we wanna see it. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7747.12s)]
*  We wanna see the explosion. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7749.96s)]
*  We wanna see someone drop a fucking grenade off a drone [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7751.2s)]
*  into some dudes that are in a pit. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7754.599999999999s)]
*  We wanna see it. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7756.44s)]
*  And I wanna know, it's like your brain's way [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7757.64s)]
*  of rehearsing in case it happens. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7759.92s)]
*  Someone recently was, I was talking to someone [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7761.52s)]
*  about dreams and nightmares. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7763.320000000001s)]
*  And they were like, nightmares is your body's way [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7764.4800000000005s)]
*  of preparing for a scenario. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7766.360000000001s)]
*  Do you have more nightmares after watching these? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7768.72s)]
*  Not really. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7770.84s)]
*  For this movie, the program, they had to cut this out [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7771.68s)]
*  and this was probably like in 91, 92, [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7774.72s)]
*  cause people were dying. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7776.360000000001s)]
*  Apparently, I think a few kids died [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7778.0s)]
*  cause they were drunk and then laying in traffic [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7780.280000000001s)]
*  like he does in this scene right here. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7782.120000000001s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7783.96s)]
*  I remember this. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7784.8s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7786.8s)]
*  He doesn't get hit obviously, but they're just crazy drunk. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7787.8s)]
*  Oh, we definitely did that in Virginia. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7791.0s)]
*  What else was there to do? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7793.0s)]
*  I never heard of anyone doing this. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7793.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7795.320000000001s)]
*  Not until the movie came out. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7796.16s)]
*  You would never go sit in the road? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7797.16s)]

*  It was some sort of a protest. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7819.72s)]
*  Like sitting on the ground. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7821.4800000000005s)]

*  They're talking shit to him. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7902.639999999999s)]
*  He's gotta get to the urologist. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7903.8s)]
*  Watch the guy with the blue hat. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7905.28s)]
*  Once you get to that age, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7910.04s)]
*  he's like, I have five more years to live. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7910.92s)]
*  I'd rather go to jail than sit in traffic. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7912.76s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7918.4800000000005s)]
*  He's got his finger on the pistol too. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7921.52s)]
*  His finger on the trigger. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7923.360000000001s)]
*  Why is anyone starting shit with him? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7924.96s)]
*  Probably just shot, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7932.16s)]
*  I'll show this in this video I guess. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7933.2s)]
*  I'll show right after it. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7934.16s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7935.08s)]
*  What did you think was gonna happen? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7941.24s)]
*  He shot two guys. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7945.48s)]
*  But there's a video that you can see [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7946.96s)]
*  him actually shooting people. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7948.2s)]
*  We don't need to be reposting that for... [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7950.16s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need to see it, but yeah. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7951.92s)]
*  But these fucking idiots that just block the road [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7954.84s)]
*  as if that's somehow not gonna fix everything [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7957.2s)]
*  or the ones that go to fucking art galleries [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7959.08s)]
*  and smash paintings. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7961.52s)]
*  I do think that there's a little bit [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7963.56s)]
*  of an invincibility complex that comes in [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7964.8s)]
*  with knowing you're being filmed. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7966.92s)]
*  They probably think, oh, there's a camera here. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7968.320000000001s)]
*  He's not gonna shoot us. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7969.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7971.08s)]
*  There's almost like... [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7971.92s)]
*  He's probably got cancer, he's 77 years old. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7972.76s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7974.68s)]
*  That's Clint Eastwood in every one of his movies. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7975.52s)]
*  Don't fuck with that guy. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7977.52s)]
*  But I do think sometimes people think, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7978.360000000001s)]
*  oh, there's a camera rolling. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7979.8s)]
*  No one's gonna hurt me. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7981.320000000001s)]
*  But it's like, that's not how everybody thinks. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7982.52s)]
*  That is so, the idea that I'm gonna throw soup [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7985.56s)]
*  at a painting. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7989.56s)]
*  I'm gonna glue myself to the wall. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7991.28s)]
*  To stop, I mean, I also try to go like, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7992.8s)]
*  okay, when I was in college, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7995.24s)]
*  I had a lot of really dumb ideas. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7996.08s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do in college. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7997.28s)]
*  You're supposed to have dumb ideas. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=7998.5199999999995s)]
*  You're supposed to be wrong. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8000.28s)]
*  But the idea that we're taking any of this seriously [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8002.92s)]
*  is just wild. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8005.28s)]
*  It's just these dumb virtue signaling kids [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8006.719999999999s)]
*  that think they're gonna fix the world [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8009.0s)]
*  by gluing themselves to a wall. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8010.36s)]
*  You fucking idiots. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8012.36s)]
*  But isn't that, I look at them and I go, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8014.08s)]
*  this is a medication mental illness issue. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8015.96s)]
*  It's a mental illness issue. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8018.759999999999s)]
*  It's a virtue signaling thing [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8020.48s)]
*  that you can do that now [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8022.959999999999s)]
*  and get exorbitant amounts of attention [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8023.959999999999s)]
*  where you couldn't do that before. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8025.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then also the punishments are so minimal. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8028.12s)]
*  It's not nothing that you have to worry about [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8030.919999999999s)]
*  losing your livelihood and the rest of your life [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8032.799999999999s)]
*  being a disaster because of it. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8035.0s)]
*  Like I say this as someone who had blue hair, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8037.0s)]
*  don't let anyone with blue hair in the museum. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8039.48s)]
*  But you know, that's not the problem. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8042.48s)]
*  You can have blue hair and be cool. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8044.879999999999s)]
*  The problem is these fucking young kids [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8047.04s)]
*  and most of them come from wealthy families. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8049.88s)]
*  That's the take. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8052.0s)]
*  They probably had a Monet in their house [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8053.8s)]
*  and they have no respect for this shit. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8055.32s)]
*  They just think they're gonna. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8057.24s)]
*  But the fact that you're doing these priceless works of art [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8058.64s)]
*  from people who died centuries ago [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8061.96s)]
*  and your cause you think eclipses everything else. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8064.92s)]
*  These people are there enjoying this art. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8068.88s)]
*  They have nothing to do with the oil industry. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8071.68s)]
*  They're just enjoying at a museum [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8073.88s)]
*  the ability to stand in front of something [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8076.4800000000005s)]
*  that Picasso made, like this is wild. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8079.44s)]
*  And is the idea that it's gonna help with global warming? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8081.719999999999s)]
*  We're gonna stop. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8084.84s)]
*  Stop oil now. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8086.08s)]
*  See, I. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8087.32s)]
*  The children, they're fucking children. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8088.16s)]
*  I have some aunts in Virginia [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8090.32s)]
*  and they're so funny about the global warming thing. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8091.4s)]
*  They're like it's freezing, we can't afford heat. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8093.24s)]
*  We'd love for it to warm up a little bit. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8094.92s)]
*  I always call them for a little perspective. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8096.599999999999s)]
*  They're like we take the bus, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8099.88s)]
*  we would love for there to be less snow on the ground. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8100.92s)]
*  I'm always super suspicious about something [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8102.84s)]
*  that becomes like a major movement [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8104.679999999999s)]
*  that everybody has to be on board with. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8106.759999999999s)]
*  The bottom line about the Earth, [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8109.8s)]
*  we are 100% affecting it. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8111.72s)]
*  It's measurable. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8113.72s)]
*  Human beings, our carbon dioxide output, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8114.84s)]
*  in particular our pollutants, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8117.68s)]
*  100% what we're doing to the ocean, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8120.0s)]
*  we're affecting the world in a negative way. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8122.12s)]
*  However, when it comes to the climate, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8124.12s)]
*  when it comes to the temperature of the Earth, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8127.04s)]
*  it has never been stable, ever, ever. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8129.16s)]
*  When you look at the Earth over a course of 10,000, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8132.6s)]
*  15,000, whatever years, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8135.76s)]
*  it goes up and it goes down. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8137.8s)]
*  I was reading this whole thing about how in Idaho, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8139.68s)]
*  in I think it was July or August of the 1930s, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8144.4400000000005s)]
*  had reached a temperature of 118 degrees, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8149.64s)]
*  like the highest ever recorded temperature there. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8154.08s)]
*  There was nothing going on there. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8155.84s)]
*  There was no fucking wholesale machines running [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8157.2s)]
*  and fucking diesel trucks everywhere. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8160.88s)]
*  There was none of that. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8163.76s)]
*  It was just, it's not stable. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8164.6s)]
*  The whole time the Earth has been here, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8167.16s)]
*  it goes up and down. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8169.76s)]
*  And what Randall Carlson always says, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8171.28s)]
*  he goes, yeah, global warming, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8172.92s)]
*  it's bad because you have to move away from the coast. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8174.32s)]
*  He goes, but global cooling is what's really scary. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8176.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what's really scary. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8180.76s)]
*  Because if we had another like legitimate ice age, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8182.24s)]
*  the fucking most of North America [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8185.8s)]
*  was covered in a mile of ice [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8188.44s)]
*  up until 11,000 years ago. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8191.96s)]
*  It always gets tricky too, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8194.68s)]
*  when the solution to the problem [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8195.84s)]
*  makes politicians richer too. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8197.56s)]
*  And everybody richer, and industry richer. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8199.16s)]
*  And people have a vested interest [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8201.119999999999s)]
*  in pushing that narrative financially. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8203.32s)]
*  And I'm not the person to be able to corroborate, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8205.48s)]
*  but Schellenberger, I like, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8209.439999999999s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger was about these windmill farms [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8211.92s)]
*  that they were putting in the oceans [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8214.679999999998s)]
*  that was killing all these whales and stuff. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8215.96s)]
*  And you're like, why is the pro-environment solution [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8217.679999999998s)]
*  killing so many animals? [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8220.64s)]
*  It definitely does. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8223.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fucking mess. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8224.960000000001s)]
*  It's a mess, but it's also people [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8226.64s)]
*  want to be on the side of something. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8228.16s)]
*  They wanna be against this, against oil, against that. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8229.88s)]
*  Instead of everybody working together, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8232.56s)]
*  figure out like what do we need to do to ensure the future? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8234.08s)]
*  And it's definitely not empowering these people [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8237.6s)]
*  that wanna take away all your autonomy [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8239.84s)]
*  and all of your control. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8242.08s)]
*  That's not how to do it. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8243.6s)]
*  That's not how to do it. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8245.28s)]
*  It seems like it's like, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8246.52s)]
*  and I love what you like your philosophy on hunting, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8247.36s)]
*  it's like factory farming, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8249.76s)]
*  like what they do with the cows and stuff, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8250.92s)]
*  they're saying is like such a problem. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8252.32s)]
*  Yeah, most factories farming is horrific. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8254.16s)]
*  People should start hunting their own food. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8256.32s)]
*  That's hard too. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8258.08s)]
*  Most people don't have time. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8259.44s)]
*  They don't have the interest, which I get too. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8261.24s)]
*  The real way to do it is regenerative farming. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8264.119999999999s)]
*  You can get regenerative, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8266.68s)]
*  like whether it's from white oaks pastures [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8269.24s)]
*  or poly face farms, there's a bunch of regenerative farms [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8272.4s)]
*  right here in Texas that are organic farms. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8275.119999999999s)]
*  You could find them, they sell locally, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8278.039999999999s)]
*  they're grass-fed meat, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8280.44s)]
*  these animals just roaming around in a pasture. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8281.880000000001s)]
*  It's all ethical. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8284.8s)]
*  That's what you want. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8285.880000000001s)]
*  But then again, if you're gonna have a city [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8288.960000000001s)]
*  of like 20 million people [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8291.12s)]
*  and there's no one growing anything other than weed, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8293.24s)]
*  you're gonna have to get food to all those people. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8297.36s)]
*  How does Jack in the Box get their burgers? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8299.52s)]
*  Or they have to have factory farming? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8301.24s)]
*  I can't remember what the country is [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8302.68s)]
*  that gives everybody two chickens. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8304.16s)]
*  I was reading about something in Hawaii [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8307.880000000001s)]
*  where they're trying to get rid [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8309.76s)]
*  of all the fruit trees and stuff [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8310.56s)]
*  so people can't even just get their own free food. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8311.96s)]
*  They can't even grow their own shit. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8313.96s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8315.519999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8316.359999999999s)]
*  I'm in a deep algorithm, a Disney dick algorithm. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8317.199999999999s)]
*  But it's like there is, I follow a couple, [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8320.68s)]
*  I'm learning how to pickle. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8322.64s)]
*  Are you really? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8324.72s)]
*  Yeah, just to be able to grow your own food [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8325.56s)]
*  and be able to. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8328.359999999999s)]
*  Once you have a baby, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8329.199999999999s)]
*  you're gonna move to the mountains or something? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8330.019999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8331.039999999999s)]
*  I think I might. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8331.88s)]
*  You know I'm looking at places in Texas. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8332.88s)]
*  I really wanna just be a full on Dr. Quinn medicine woman. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8334.56s)]
*  Yeah, that would be awesome. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8337.92s)]
*  And you could have zebras out here. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8339.52s)]
*  Oh, sick. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8341.16s)]

*  I'm sold. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8342.84s)]

*  I think they kill a lot of people every year. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8380.76s)]
*  I think it's hundreds of people every year [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8382.96s)]
*  die from hippos. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8384.24s)]
*  Just by charging or they? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8385.08s)]
*  They eat you. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8386.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8386.92s)]
*  They just smash you in half. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8387.74s)]
*  It's fucking wild, dude. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8388.58s)]
*  When you see them eat a watermelon, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8389.64s)]
*  you're like, ah. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8390.96s)]
*  Dude, that's your head. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8392.039999999999s)]
*  I love that Pablo Escobar has just had that. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8393.4s)]
*  I wonder if, is that part of how he killed people? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8396.2s)]
*  Just throw them to the hippos? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8399.2s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8400.039999999999s)]
*  I bet. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8401.12s)]
*  Why not? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8401.96s)]
*  I pity killed people every different way [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8402.8s)]
*  you could think of. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8404.4s)]
*  I mean, when you're on Coke and you're a billionaire [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8405.68s)]
*  and you're running an entire country with bullets. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8408.16s)]
*  That's such a funny way. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8411.48s)]
*  Just like, ah, this is hippo. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8413.72s)]
*  This is a hippo guy. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8414.96s)]
*  But I do, I wanna start doing all that. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8416.72s)]
*  I wanna start growing my own food. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8419.0s)]
*  I'm getting into it. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8420.6s)]
*  You should. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8421.72s)]
*  Yeah, you could have your own small farm [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8422.68s)]
*  and just completely exist off of your own land. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8424.240000000002s)]
*  That's totally doable for someone. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8426.960000000001s)]
*  And that's literally what people used to do [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8428.480000000001s)]
*  in the early days of America. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8431.240000000002s)]
*  Just to have an option. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8432.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, even like, you'll love this. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8433.68s)]
*  I'm pretty much only eating steak and eggs right now. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8436.28s)]
*  Being pregnant, I feel better pregnant [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8441.880000000001s)]
*  than I felt not pregnant. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8444.28s)]
*  Because when I wasn't, I was eating [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8446.28s)]
*  what I thought I was supposed to eat. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8448.0s)]
*  I gotta eat vegetables and oatmeal for breakfast. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8449.28s)]
*  I was eating so much sugar and trash. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8451.84s)]
*  And when you're pregnant, you only eat what you're craving. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8453.560000000001s)]
*  Your body is like, tonight you're having a steak, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8455.640000000001s)]
*  two eggs, one scoop of peanut butter, and four raspberries. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8458.0s)]
*  So you just did it out of desire? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8461.4s)]
*  It's just all I'm craving. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8463.560000000001s)]
*  Interesting. It's all I've been craving. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8465.0s)]
*  Everything else kinda made me nauseous [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8466.16s)]
*  or made me feel run down. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8467.48s)]
*  Like I have, but also, [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8468.640000000001s)]
*  this is gonna probably get me in a little bit of trouble. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8471.0s)]
*  I'm also obviously not on birth control. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8472.6s)]
*  And I was on birth control for a while. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8474.4s)]
*  Why would that get you in trouble? [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8476.640000000001s)]
*  I just, look, birth control was just not good for me. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8478.28s)]
*  Personally. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8483.0s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of problems with it [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8483.839999999998s)]
*  for almost everybody. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8485.279999999999s)]
*  And there's also a lot of problems with maybe having, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8486.679999999998s)]
*  I'm glad I didn't have a kid at 25 either. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8488.679999999998s)]
*  That would have maybe been a problem too. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8490.24s)]
*  But my energy levels were low. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8492.0s)]
*  I was always, I mean, there was one I was on last year [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8493.8s)]
*  that made me like pretty manic. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8496.88s)]
*  Manic, and what they say is they say, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8498.96s)]
*  oh, it makes your body think it's pregnant, right? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8501.679999999998s)]
*  I've now been pregnant. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8504.8s)]
*  It's not the same. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8505.8s)]
*  It is not the same at all. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8507.56s)]
*  Cause I was like, oh, being hypervigilant, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8509.08s)]
*  being a little paranoid, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8511.12s)]
*  being kind of always a little bit tired, [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8512.36s)]
*  putting weight on, like that's not my experience [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8514.36s)]
*  now that I'm actually pregnant. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8516.320000000002s)]
*  And I feel like I lost a lot of time mentally [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8517.44s)]
*  to being on birth control. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8521.880000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8523.160000000002s)]
*  So it affected your thinking process. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8524.0s)]
*  I feel like now I'm so much more mentally clear. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8526.160000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of other variables. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8528.800000000001s)]
*  Like, I started, you guys saw, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8530.2s)]
*  I went through kind of a little bit of a rough patch, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8534.44s)]
*  lost my mom, was smoking too much weed, [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8539.2s)]
*  which I'm sure I could do again in the future. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8541.52s)]
*  Like I just, I was doing it to check out [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8543.240000000002s)]
*  instead of check in. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8545.720000000001s)]
*  I was doing it to numb myself from pain, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8546.92s)]
*  but my mom was dying right in front of me in hospice [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8549.52s)]
*  and I couldn't cry. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8552.560000000001s)]
*  And I was like, this is weird. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8554.28s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8556.480000000001s)]
*  I didn't mean she had been in bed for 12 years. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8557.320000000002s)]
*  I was kind of slowly grieving it, but it's not normal. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8558.800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I gotta go off birth control. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8562.52s)]
*  There's something off here with my emotions. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8563.880000000001s)]
*  And look, all my exes listening love you, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8566.52s)]
*  but it also makes you attracted, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8569.52s)]
*  you smell pheromones differently. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8571.76s)]
*  Women that are on birth control, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8574.04s)]
*  there was a study where they're attracted to men [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8575.6s)]
*  with more feminized faces. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8578.08s)]
*  They say that you should go off birth control for a year [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8580.640000000001s)]
*  if you're engaged to a man before you actually get married [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8582.92s)]
*  just to make sure that you're still attracted. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8585.800000000001s)]
*  Because it just, it hacks your body chemistry so much. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8589.36s)]
*  You look for a different kind of man when you're pregnant [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8591.28s)]
*  versus when you're not. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8593.2s)]
*  So yeah, all the hormones I think [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8595.64s)]
*  really did a number on my brain. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8598.92s)]
*  My sex drive was really low. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8601.48s)]
*  I was, didn't, I just, I had no energy, but. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8604.56s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8607.119999999999s)]
*  Couldn't sleep. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8608.08s)]
*  I mean, they're mucking with your hormonal balance [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8608.92s)]
*  to trick your body into thinking that it's pregnant [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8611.279999999999s)]
*  so that you can't get pregnant. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8613.72s)]
*  And you're taking it every month forever and ever. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8615.32s)]
*  And some people get blood clots. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8618.56s)]
*  A friend of mine's 17 year old daughter. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8619.92s)]
*  Apparently if you smoke cigarettes, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8621.519999999999s)]
*  it's very dangerous to be on birth control and smoke cigarettes. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8623.56s)]
*  That's really dangerous. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8626.439999999999s)]
*  They put me on it. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8627.4s)]
*  I mean, when, I mean, these studies are all public, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8628.279999999999s)]
*  but when they first tested it in the 70s, [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8630.48s)]
*  I think at least 13 women in Puerto Rico died from taking it. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8632.279999999999s)]
*  And then also in addition to the hormones, [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8636.72s)]
*  there's all the endocrine disruptors and hormone shit [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8638.68s)]
*  that were, there's a lot of other variables too [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8642.0s)]
*  that are probably exacerbating it. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8644.199999999999s)]
*  But I just felt like a zombie a lot of the time. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8645.439999999999s)]
*  And then they put me on Adderall because I was too, [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8649.24s)]
*  and then it just becomes this whack-a-mole thing [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8652.480000000001s)]
*  where you're like, how about instead of adding all these other things, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8654.36s)]
*  I just subtract this thing? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8656.36s)]
*  And then I was put on Prozac. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8658.6s)]
*  And then I was like smoking weed to try to fall asleep [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8661.08s)]
*  because I couldn't sleep. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8663.76s)]
*  But then it was like, I just need to get off all of this. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8664.640000000001s)]
*  So in January, I just went off literally everything. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8667.480000000001s)]
*  Well, you seem remarkably balanced. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8670.76s)]
*  Oh, thanks. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8672.68s)]
*  You do. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8673.52s)]
*  You're like, you're there all the time. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8674.4s)]
*  Because sometimes you would be off to the races. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8676.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I definitely have intense persons, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8679.52s)]
*  just by default. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8684.12s)]
*  But I think that being on birth control, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8686.4s)]
*  I was kind of exhausted and manic at the same time, all the time. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8689.12s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8693.12s)]
*  And it does put you in a state of hypervigilance, being pregnant. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8694.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm nesting. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8697.720000000001s)]
*  I want to be organized, obviously. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8698.6s)]
*  I'm thinking about the kid, obviously, and taking care of myself. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8700.68s)]
*  But I look back at the time that I was on a lot of that birth control shit. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8704.32s)]
*  Also, people say, well, birth control [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8708.4s)]
*  led to this sexual revolution, where women had freedom. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8711.88s)]
*  They could do whatever. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8716.119999999999s)]
*  They didn't have to worry about being knocked up by a guy [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8716.96s)]
*  if they wanted to have recreational sex. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8720.0s)]
*  And so people plotted it for that. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8722.6s)]
*  But no one thought about the long-term consequences. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8725.279999999999s)]
*  And then also, the difference in how people interact with each other. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8728.44s)]
*  Like, there was a consequence when people were living in the 1930s [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8734.04s)]
*  or whatever. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8739.04s)]
*  You could get pregnant. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8740.04s)]
*  Everyone was aware of it. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8742.4s)]
*  There was a danger to it. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8743.84s)]
*  And when you could just take a pill and not sweat it, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8745.44s)]
*  then it's just like this change in your natural behavior. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8748.56s)]
*  And yeah, I guess I feel like I stayed in a lot of it. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8752.52s)]
*  I mean, granted, look, not that I was ready to have a kid before now, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8754.6s)]
*  not that I was ready to commit to anyone, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8758.68s)]
*  that I wasn't fully cooked as a person yet or whatever. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8760.44s)]
*  But I found myself staying in a lot of relationships [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8762.72s)]
*  that I probably shouldn't have stayed in, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8765.039999999999s)]
*  that if I hadn't been on birth control, I'd be like, oh, this [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8767.359999999999s)]
*  isn't the father of my kid. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8769.599999999999s)]
*  I should move on. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8770.439999999999s)]
*  Or you end up getting chemically addicted to somebody [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8771.84s)]
*  through having good sex with someone or getting [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8775.0s)]
*  all the oxytocin or whatever. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8777.56s)]
*  And then you end up staying in a lot of relationships [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8778.92s)]
*  you maybe shouldn't stay in instead of just working on yourself. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8780.8s)]
*  I initially went on it so crazy. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8784.679999999998s)]
*  I think about all the weird, because I used to do for money. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8786.92s)]
*  When I first moved to LA and I was broke, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8790.08s)]
*  I would do focus groups and I would take these experimental pills [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8791.76s)]
*  and do these clinical trials and stuff. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8795.2s)]
*  But when I was, I want to say 15, I went on Accutane, [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8796.800000000001s)]
*  which is that acne medication. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8800.44s)]
*  And they make you take birth control simultaneously. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8802.64s)]
*  So that's the first time I went on it at 15 years old. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8804.92s)]
*  So I was on Accutane, which you know. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8809.08s)]
*  Santino said it was the worst thing he ever took. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8811.92s)]
*  I mean, the main side effect is anal bleeding. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8814.6s)]
*  That's the main one? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8818.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8818.68s)]
*  And you can't absorb vitamin D well. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8821.08s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of problems. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8823.320000000002s)]
*  It made Santino look super depressed. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8824.960000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8826.76s)]
*  Yeah, he said it was fucking horrible. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8827.480000000001s)]
*  But it did fix his acne. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8828.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it works. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8830.08s)]
*  It's a miracle. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8832.240000000002s)]
*  Because it shrinks your, I think it's a huge dose of vitamin A, [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8833.400000000001s)]
*  I believe is what it is. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8837.400000000001s)]
*  Please correct me if I'm wrong. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8838.6s)]
*  But it shrinks your oil glands. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8840.6s)]
*  Some patients may develop tears in the lining of the anus, which [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8843.68s)]
*  may cause pain and bleeding, especially [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8848.0s)]
*  during bowel movements. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8849.88s)]
*  Duh. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8851.24s)]
*  When's it going to cause pain? [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8854.119999999999s)]
*  It's like, but my skin's all cleared up. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8855.8s)]
*  You take massive shits and your shit pipe is ripped open. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8857.679999999998s)]
*  So I was put on it at that. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8860.32s)]
*  And I just think about all the prescription drugs. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8861.56s)]
*  I was put on at such a young age. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8864.72s)]
*  And God, what kind of impact that had. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8867.0s)]
*  Well, there's so many people that are on them. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8869.24s)]
*  And so many people that are young, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8871.08s)]
*  and they don't even get a chance to make [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8872.4s)]
*  that decision for themselves. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8874.16s)]
*  They're certainly not making an informed decision. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8875.679999999998s)]
*  Parents just listen to their doctors, [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8878.76s)]
*  and doctors are just pill pushers. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8880.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8882.12s)]
*  And I was actually put on, I mean, [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8882.960000000001s)]
*  this was a couple years ago. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8884.32s)]
*  And I didn't take it that much, but five milligrams [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8887.2s)]
*  of time release Adderall to sleep. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8890.12s)]
*  So I guess it's like, if you actually have ADHD, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8892.68s)]
*  Adderall calms you down. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8895.84s)]
*  And I'm like, maybe I just need to be tired longer. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8897.52s)]
*  Maybe I just need to get up and do some shit. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8902.84s)]
*  Maybe I just need to write some jokes. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8904.8s)]
*  Maybe I just am going to go to sleep a little bit later [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8906.36s)]
*  and wake up a little bit later. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8908.08s)]
*  And there's another one, like the Ambien people. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8908.68s)]
*  People that have to take Ambien to go to sleep. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8911.08s)]
*  Dude, have you taken it? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8913.08s)]
*  No. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8915.44s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8916.24s)]
*  You should try it. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8917.12s)]
*  It's everyone that takes Ambien, I'm kind of like, my man. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8918.960000000001s)]
*  I've taken it before. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8923.44s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8924.28s)]
*  The problem is, I think you try to fight it, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8925.2s)]
*  because it feels good. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8928.16s)]
*  And I would wake up the next morning, [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8929.32s)]
*  and there would just be open cans of peas that I would sleep [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8930.800000000001s)]
*  eat. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8934.84s)]
*  I would wake up. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8935.76s)]
*  I remember one morning I woke up, I thought I had been shot. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8936.68s)]
*  I was covered in barbecue sauce. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8938.52s)]
*  I had just eaten barbecue. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8940.04s)]
*  It makes you do wild shit. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8941.2s)]
*  Every now and then, I'm like, we should probably [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8942.960000000001s)]
*  at least try the drug that everyone's on, going crazy on, [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8944.800000000001s)]
*  just to see. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8947.72s)]
*  The problem is if you like it, it ruins your life. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8948.48s)]
*  That's what I'm worried about with a lot of drugs. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8951.56s)]
*  I'd love to try Adderall. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8953.56s)]
*  But I don't want that to be a thing that I lean on sometimes. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8955.16s)]
*  When I wrote a book, I took it a couple times, like 20 [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8959.48s)]
*  milligrams. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8962.56s)]
*  You got to really make sure. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8963.56s)]
*  We already are pretty motivated people. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8966.679999999998s)]
*  You got to really make sure that you lock into the thing [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8968.48s)]
*  you want to focus on, or else you'll just be. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8971.08s)]
*  All over the place. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8973.88s)]
*  Yeah, or you'll just be cleaning one thing for four and a half [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8974.88s)]
*  hours. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8978.039999999999s)]
*  That's meth behavior, too. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8979.039999999999s)]
*  Isn't it boiled down to being meth? [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8981.4s)]
*  It's pretty close. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8983.0s)]
*  It's definitely meth's cousin. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8984.16s)]
*  And what's the difference between that and Ritalin? [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8985.92s)]
*  I know people that are still on Ritalin. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8988.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Ritalin's a little bit different. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8990.119999999999s)]
*  And Modafinil is another one, right? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8991.72s)]
*  Modafinil is ProVigil. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8994.16s)]
*  Oh, ProVigil. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8995.56s)]
*  ProVigil and NuVigil. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8996.56s)]
*  And those are, originally they were drugs that I believe were [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=8997.88s)]
*  developed for performance enhancing. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9001.68s)]
*  Like for cognitive performance. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9005.2s)]
*  But then they realized that you can't prescribe it for that. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9006.6s)]
*  So they started prescribing it for narcolepsy. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9009.44s)]
*  But it keeps you from going to sleep. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9012.56s)]
*  But it doesn't, it's a weird one. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9014.119999999999s)]
*  Because it doesn't make you feel like you're high. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9015.96s)]
*  But there's an interesting reaction that your brain has. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9021.480000000001s)]
*  A lot of people are on it. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9026.4s)]
*  A lot of people are on it. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9028.16s)]
*  And it's so effective that I think [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9029.76s)]
*  Tim Ferriss said when he was writing his book [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9031.68s)]
*  about different hacks that he didn't put it in there. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9033.92s)]
*  Because he felt like people would be eating it like candy. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9036.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9038.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, I got to say, when we were doing the roasts last year, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9039.960000000001s)]
*  a lot of the writers and comics, they [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9044.92s)]
*  were doing the mushrooms in chocolate, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9047.0s)]
*  like three milligrams of mushrooms in chocolate. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9050.84s)]
*  And I did that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9052.76s)]
*  That felt like, I felt so clear. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9054.12s)]
*  I felt energized. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9057.28s)]
*  I was like. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9058.12s)]
*  Microdosing. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9058.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9059.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9060.0s)]
*  That's a good move. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9061.2s)]
*  Whatever my brain chemistry was, I [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9062.08s)]
*  thought it would chill me out and make me sort of numb [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9064.24s)]
*  or not funny. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9067.44s)]
*  It made me feel very, because maybe I wasn't bogged down. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9068.84s)]
*  And I don't know what it does. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9071.880000000001s)]
*  Makes you feel like there was no negativity towards myself. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9074.36s)]
*  I would pitch a joke and not be like, [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9078.08s)]
*  oh, that was a stupid joke, you idiot. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9079.96s)]
*  The voices went away. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9081.599999999999s)]
*  And I found that. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9083.599999999999s)]
*  But then I did a little too much and scheduled a call [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9084.919999999998s)]
*  with the maritime lawyer to look for the Scientology ships. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9089.039999999999s)]
*  Why did you want to look for the Scientology ships? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9092.519999999999s)]
*  Find the homeless people? [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9095.199999999999s)]
*  Where are they putting the homeless people? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9096.519999999999s)]
*  With me, it's like the microdose has to stay micro. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9099.56s)]
*  Or else I really need to know where Shelley Miscavige is. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9103.16s)]
*  Is that a thing? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9107.279999999999s)]
*  My guess is she's probably involved. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9109.76s)]
*  I don't think she's an innocent. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9111.48s)]
*  Everyone's like, where's Shelley Miscavige? [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9112.52s)]
*  Let's find her. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9113.88s)]
*  I'm like, I bet she's an asshole too. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9114.36s)]
*  But is that a thing? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9116.12s)]
*  She's missing still? [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9117.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9118.12s)]
*  I think she's still missing. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9118.64s)]
*  But I did get kind of obsessed with the maritime law, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9119.88s)]
*  how Scientologists are able to operate on the ships, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9123.36s)]
*  because there's maritime law. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9126.28s)]
*  They can get away with it. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9127.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9128.84s)]
*  Isn't that one of the main reasons [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9129.36s)]
*  why L. Ron Hubbard started that? [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9130.84s)]
*  Because he was probably in trouble. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9133.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9135.32s)]
*  And it's also why billionaires, I'm like, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9135.52s)]
*  why are you docking your yacht? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9137.24s)]
*  100 yards from land, why aren't you just [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9139.439999999999s)]
*  staying in the best hotel in the world? [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9141.56s)]
*  Oh, because of what you can get away with. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9143.24s)]
*  Also, you have a yacht. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9144.84s)]
*  You also do that. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9146.359999999999s)]
*  It's a fucking dope ass house that floats around the ocean. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9147.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9150.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9151.359999999999s)]
*  I guess if I had a yacht, OK, I guess if I had a yacht. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9151.679999999998s)]
*  Fuck out of here with that hotel. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9153.88s)]
*  But it's like, I guess I got really into the laws [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9156.84s)]
*  of how Epstein Island had all these plastic cows [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9159.16s)]
*  that someone would move from above or something. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9164.64s)]
*  Oh, so it looks like it's agricultural land? [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9167.52s)]
*  Really? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9170.2s)]
*  This is why I can't do mushrooms, Joe. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9170.68s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9172.44s)]
*  They had fake agriculture? [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9173.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so that it would move. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9175.720000000001s)]
*  I just love the idea that it was someone's job [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9177.32s)]
*  every morning to get up and move the fake cows. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9179.36s)]
*  It is weird that you like, that's [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9182.640000000001s)]
*  the whole thing about fishing. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9184.52s)]
*  It's like international waters. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9186.16s)]
*  They can kind of get away with a lot of shit. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9187.880000000001s)]
*  They can just scoop up everything that's out there. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9190.24s)]
*  They get caught in their nets. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9193.24s)]
*  A lot goes on out there. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9194.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9196.04s)]
*  A lot of wild shit happens out there. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9196.6s)]
*  LAPD closed Shelly Miskevich's missing person [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9199.12s)]
*  case after a woman claimed she was the Scientology leader's [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9202.12s)]
*  wife, despite the fact they had mismatched fingerprints [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9204.76s)]
*  and footage of their rendezvous was mysteriously scrambled. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9208.48s)]
*  Scrambled? [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9211.76s)]
*  She was last seen publicly at her father's funeral in 2007. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9213.16s)]
*  What? [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9216.32s)]
*  I mean. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9218.36s)]
*  Well, they closed the case in 2013? [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9219.08s)]
*  After meeting a woman who didn't. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9223.2s)]
*  So it's been going on for that long? [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9224.92s)]
*  That she's been missing. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9227.12s)]
*  But do we really think she was, I mean, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9230.24s)]
*  she was probably blowing him every time he got a new [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9233.04s)]
*  celebrity in the set. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9235.12s)]
*  You got John Travolta. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9237.4s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9239.04s)]
*  That is wild, though. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9239.92s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9241.48s)]
*  If she really is missing? [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9242.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9245.12s)]
*  16 years. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9246.52s)]
*  That whole thing is absolutely bonkers. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9249.0s)]
*  They're still out there running around. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9251.8s)]
*  Not only, but also kids born into it, that's where I go. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9253.6s)]
*  That's not OK if you're born into it. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9257.16s)]
*  But if you're the kind of person that's [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9258.8s)]
*  susceptible to Scientology, is it not a good idea for you? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9259.92s)]
*  I mean, it's like, what would they [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9263.4s)]
*  be doing if they weren't in that castle in LA? [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9266.0s)]
*  Other things? [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9271.359999999999s)]
*  What would you be doing? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9273.4s)]
*  The fuck is that mean? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9275.359999999999s)]
*  If they weren't making iPhones, they'd starve to death. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9277.519999999999s)]
*  If they weren't in the mines digging out those precious, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9281.24s)]
*  rare earth minerals. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9284.88s)]
*  If you're an adult that's susceptible to Scientology [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9286.4s)]
*  at this point, maybe you need it. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9289.039999999999s)]
*  That was my joke about Mormons. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9293.4s)]
*  Remember when it was Proposition 8, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9296.4s)]
*  they were trying to stop gay marriage? [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9299.24s)]
*  And they actually did. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9301.52s)]
*  They overturned gay marriage in California. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9302.88s)]
*  But the Mormons spent the most money on it. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9305.199999999999s)]
*  They spent a ton of money to try to reverse gay marriage. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9307.2s)]
*  And I said, but if you're a Mormon, [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9311.44s)]
*  you should be afraid of gay people. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9313.08s)]
*  Because if someone can talk you into being a Mormon, [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9316.04s)]
*  they could talk you into sucking their dick. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9320.960000000001s)]
*  They just need a little more alone time with you. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9322.560000000001s)]
*  A plus. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9325.400000000001s)]
*  Everyone I know that's Mormon is gay, by the way. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9326.960000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's just because the ones that leave come to LA. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9329.92s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very strange. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9333.16s)]
*  There's a lot of really cool Mormons. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9337.359999999999s)]
*  I should say this. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9339.359999999999s)]
*  Because I spent a lot of time in Utah. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9340.08s)]
*  And I have a lot of Mormon friends. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9341.84s)]
*  And I love them to death. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9343.64s)]
*  They're the nicest cult members. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9344.96s)]
*  They're very polite. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9346.599999999999s)]
*  They believe in community. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9348.24s)]
*  They believe in what they're doing. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9349.96s)]
*  But then there's these sects of Mormonism, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9351.519999999999s)]
*  sect of Mormonism, where you have these guys that [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9354.08s)]
*  have 19 underage wives that are all dressed [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9357.56s)]
*  like fucking pilgrims. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9360.48s)]
*  You know that weird shit? [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9361.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9363.039999999999s)]
*  They always find those guys. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9363.539999999999s)]
*  That's the song that they sing. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9365.84s)]
*  Stay sweet or is it be sweet? [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9368.44s)]
*  What's the motto that they inculcate into the girls? [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9370.0s)]
*  Be sweet. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9372.32s)]
*  But there's a few of those guys, right? [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9373.48s)]
*  They get in trouble. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9375.12s)]
*  They probably are. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9376.4s)]
*  OK, I'm just saying, what's the point of having a young bride [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9377.8s)]
*  if her forehead's that big? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9380.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9383.72s)]
*  You put a Spider-Man helmet on her. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9385.12s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9386.76s)]
*  Keep sweet, pray, and obey. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9388.32s)]
*  Yeah, they sing this song. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9390.32s)]
*  Oh, blue hair. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9391.6s)]
*  They look like they have blue hair. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9392.28s)]
*  Me during the pandemic. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9393.36s)]
*  And Jeff's in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9394.24s)]
*  of Latter-day Saints. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9397.24s)]
*  Apparently, Salt Lake City has the highest plastic surgery [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9398.52s)]
*  rate because it's women going in after having 12 kids getting [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9400.88s)]
*  their bodies shellacked back together. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9405.32s)]
*  Imagine you have 12 kids by the time you're 30. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9411.44s)]
*  What a bum deal. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9413.84s)]
*  Bum deal. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9415.199999999999s)]
*  Because it's like the guy, all the guy does is has sex, [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9415.84s)]
*  which they always do and they want to do anyway. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9418.8s)]
*  And the woman has to carry this fucking baby for nine whole [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9420.88s)]
*  months for body changes. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9424.679999999998s)]
*  And then on the way out, the cooter gets blown out. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9426.72s)]
*  OK, I'm about to have this happen. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9432.039999999999s)]
*  So this is not the time. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9434.039999999999s)]
*  Ask for an extra stitch. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9435.359999999999s)]
*  This is not the time. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9436.679999999998s)]
*  Get that fucking. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9438.24s)]
*  To say this. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9439.16s)]
*  While it's all numb, you might want to stitch it up yourself. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9440.039999999999s)]
*  It's going to go back. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9443.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'll go back. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9443.839999999998s)]
*  I'm going to do the cold plunge and it'll. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9444.599999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9445.96s)]
*  Show right back up. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9447.24s)]
*  But it's also stretch marks and some women get these like they [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9448.32s)]
*  are there. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9452.56s)]
*  Different people's skin has different levels [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9453.96s)]
*  of elasticity. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9456.24s)]
*  Some people, they just gain a little bit of weight [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9457.56s)]
*  and they get stretch marks and it appears that it's genetic. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9459.119999999999s)]
*  OK. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9461.56s)]
*  And so some women, they can have a baby [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9462.16s)]
*  and their body shrinks right back to normal [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9464.72s)]
*  and they have toned abs. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9466.48s)]
*  And other women, they just their stomach is just a mess. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9467.44s)]
*  And so then they have to hack off a giant chunk of skin [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9470.44s)]
*  and stitch it all together. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9473.52s)]
*  Because I've been doing these exercises so that your abs don't [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9476.44s)]
*  tear apart. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9479.48s)]
*  You got to do this whole thing. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9480.8s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9482.08s)]
*  It's like a specific, it's not Pilates per se, [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9483.08s)]
*  but it's to keep to make sure that they don't rip. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9486.56s)]
*  And I'm inducing like a week early. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9489.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9490.92s)]
*  You know. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9491.52s)]
*  Why are you going to do that? [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9492.24s)]
*  Because you can kind of do it at like one week sooner. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9493.44s)]
*  What do they use to induce? [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9496.44s)]
*  Pitocin, I think it is. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9497.96s)]
*  Is there side effects associated with pitocin? [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9499.8s)]
*  Keeping a tight ass pussy. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9502.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9504.32s)]
*  Let's Google what are the side effects associated [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9505.24s)]
*  with pitocin. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9507.6s)]
*  Because whenever someone says something like induce, [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9508.4s)]
*  I'm like, hmm. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9510.56s)]
*  Do you know that that was originally the use of LSD? [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9511.16s)]
*  No. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9515.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9515.52s)]
*  I think it was, I think that was what they originally [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9516.6s)]
*  were trying to formulate LSD for. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9519.32s)]
*  They were trying to use it. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9521.119999999999s)]
*  To induce labor. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9522.199999999999s)]
*  I thought it was to brainwash people. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9524.88s)]
*  They eventually started using it for that too. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9527.44s)]
*  They started using it for a bunch of things, [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9529.52s)]
*  which they realized. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9530.96s)]
*  Pretty sure the initial uses of LSD. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9531.84s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9537.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9537.84s)]
*  I also, is it true that LSD, I've only done it once, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9538.6s)]
*  the tabs, that you have flashbacks later in life? [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9541.6s)]
*  I bet if you crank your brain up to 10 for too long, [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9545.28s)]
*  I bet it's a little residual effect. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9548.48s)]
*  I do. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9551.32s)]
*  I mean, Christina, Christina Pazitzy, love you. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9552.36s)]
*  She told me, I'm just doing her birth plan. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9555.44s)]
*  She's like, the second you walk in, she gave me the whole, [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9557.56s)]
*  I'm just doing what she did. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9560.8s)]
*  That's smart. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9561.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9562.4s)]
*  Are there side effects associated with pitocin use? [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9562.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9565.119999999999s)]
*  Uh oh. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9565.619999999999s)]
*  Oh yes. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9566.119999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's side effects to everything, but. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9566.619999999999s)]
*  What does pitocin do to the baby? [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9569.16s)]
*  Useful in situations where the mother and laborer are [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9570.88s)]
*  experiencing weak contractions, the laborer [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9572.84s)]
*  isn't progressing normally. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9574.48s)]
*  However, the use of pitocin should [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9575.599999999999s)]
*  be treated as a delicate process that [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9577.16s)]
*  needs to be monitored properly, or else it [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9578.92s)]
*  could be dangerous complications. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9580.679999999998s)]
*  If the pitocin is misused during labor, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9582.599999999999s)]
*  it puts both the baby and the mother at risk [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9584.48s)]
*  due to hyper stimulation. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9586.32s)]
*  But it does, I guess the bigger the baby gets, [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9590.6s)]
*  the more the risk of a C-section comes. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9593.32s)]
*  So this might little bit lower the risk of. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9596.6s)]
*  That'll protect your cooter. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9598.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9600.48s)]
*  Go out through the hatch. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9601.52s)]
*  Just full Sigourney Weaver and alien. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9602.52s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9605.0s)]
*  But also, I want to have another one at some point. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9607.84s)]
*  And if you get a cesarean, you have to wait a little longer. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9610.36s)]
*  I can't have an only child. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9612.4s)]
*  They're weird. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9613.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9615.28s)]
*  You get adopted. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9615.84s)]
*  That's true. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9616.88s)]
*  From where? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9618.68s)]
*  Have you seen that there's a price list? [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9619.36s)]
*  Well, it depends on where you live. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9621.44s)]
*  If you live in LA, you should definitely [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9622.36s)]
*  adopt from Africa to get some social credit. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9626.0s)]
*  Adopt from the poorest village. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9628.36s)]
*  Where do people get their babies? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9631.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know, but there's a price list [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9633.16s)]
*  that there's different ethnicities [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9634.28s)]
*  or different prices. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9635.92s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9636.84s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9637.640000000001s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9638.400000000001s)]
*  What's the cheapest? [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9639.28s)]
*  I'm going to let you take this one. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9641.36s)]
*  Young mom of 22 wants to have more than 100 babies [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9643.6s)]
*  with wealthy older husband. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9647.12s)]
*  They've already got like 26 kids or something like that. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9649.8s)]
*  How? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9651.880000000001s)]
*  Surrogates. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9652.6s)]
*  Oh. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9653.6s)]
*  A lot of people are doing the surrogate deal now. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9654.84s)]
*  Boy, that's weird. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9656.92s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9658.28s)]
*  Just right in the womb. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9659.08s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9660.28s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9661.36s)]
*  And then you also got to think, you [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9662.32s)]
*  have to monitor the diet of the person that's having the baby, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9663.56s)]
*  make sure they're not doing drugs. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9665.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9667.32s)]
*  If they're not going to raise the kid, why not smoke crack? [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9667.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9670.2s)]
*  There is a, like, if the surrogate doesn't eat well, [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9670.8s)]
*  the baby will just start eating, leeching from their bones [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9677.64s)]
*  and brain. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9680.24s)]
*  So it will do a lot of damage to the surrogate, maybe more [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9681.439999999999s)]
*  than the baby. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9684.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9684.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9685.359999999999s)]
*  That's osteoporosis, right? [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9685.88s)]
*  Some of that comes from that. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9687.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9688.8s)]
*  But I'm doing, they're saying I'm doing the fish oil like [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9690.119999999999s)]
*  crazy. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9693.0s)]
*  Do you eat? [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9694.0s)]
*  I'm not a fish person. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9695.16s)]
*  I love fish. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9696.24s)]
*  Yeah, but the Fukushima thing really freaks me out. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9697.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've talked to people that are terrified of it. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9700.119999999999s)]
*  And then I've talked to Elon, who's not even remotely [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9703.039999999999s)]
*  worried about it. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9705.039999999999s)]
*  OK. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9705.68s)]
*  His brain works pretty well. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9706.88s)]
*  I think he's probably more along the correct path. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9708.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9711.64s)]
*  Yeah, I love fish. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9712.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9713.279999999999s)]
*  Jamie hates it. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9714.08s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9714.84s)]
*  Really? [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9715.16s)]
*  Hates it. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9715.8s)]
*  We had a. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9716.64s)]
*  Sushi? [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9717.16s)]
*  You don't do sushi? [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9717.64s)]
*  What? [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9718.68s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9719.68s)]
*  He's from Ohio. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9720.199999999999s)]
*  They just eat potatoes and stuff. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9721.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there's not a lot of water there. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9722.16s)]
*  They eat steak and potatoes. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9723.64s)]
*  Giant lake. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9724.76s)]
*  Huh? [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9725.52s)]
*  It's a giant lake. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9726.039999999999s)]
*  No salmon? [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9727.0s)]
*  None of it? [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9727.6s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9728.56s)]
*  Crab? [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9729.08s)]
*  I can do crab legs. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9730.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9730.92s)]
*  Not a lot of it, though. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9731.96s)]
*  Delicious, though. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9732.56s)]
*  Butter, necessary. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9733.44s)]
*  Lobster? [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9734.64s)]
*  I've had it. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9735.8s)]
*  I had deep-fried lobster here. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9736.32s)]
*  That was fucking interesting. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9737.759999999998s)]
*  Deep-fried lobster is the bomb. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9738.24s)]
*  That was at Three Forks, right? [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9739.56s)]
*  It sure was. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9740.759999999998s)]
*  Chicken fried lobster. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9741.4s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9742.599999999999s)]
*  The only one I wanted to eat while I was here is Red Ash, [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9743.519999999999s)]
*  but it burned down? [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9745.279999999999s)]
*  Burned down. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9746.119999999999s)]
*  Don't name your restaurant that. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9747.72s)]
*  Well, they had a giant live fire grill area, I guess. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9749.359999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9753.24s)]
*  I honestly am just guessing. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9753.72s)]
*  I don't know where. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9754.84s)]
*  See, what started the fire at Red Ash? [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9755.64s)]
*  But the guy who ran Red Ash, John Carver, [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9758.039999999999s)]
*  opened up Jay Carver's, which is. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9762.039999999999s)]
*  I hear it's great. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9763.96s)]
*  That's so good. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9765.16s)]
*  So good. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9765.68s)]
*  That's my favorite spot. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9766.2s)]
*  Oh, I should have gone. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9767.119999999999s)]
*  That's my favorite spot. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9768.119999999999s)]
*  Or maybe I'll go tonight. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9768.48s)]
*  There's so many spots to go to, though. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9769.2s)]
*  There's this new Mexican spot that we've been talking about [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9771.119999999999s)]
*  called Bacalar. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9773.0s)]
*  I saw that, Brian. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9774.08s)]
*  I saw it on your Instagram. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9775.08s)]
*  I found a new Korean. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9775.68s)]
*  It's not new, but it's open till 2 o'clock in the morning. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9776.72s)]
*  It's called Soha. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9778.96s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9779.96s)]
*  Super authentic Korean food. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9781.24s)]
*  And what do you get when you get Korean? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9783.4s)]
*  Well, there I got this. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9785.56s)]
*  It was squid. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9788.64s)]
*  And it was like this spicy squid and something. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9790.12s)]
*  Oh, squid and pork belly. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9797.68s)]
*  It was fantastic. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9799.44s)]
*  It was really good. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9800.48s)]
*  Do you ever make bone broth out of your elk bones? [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9801.24s)]
*  No, I don't. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9803.68s)]
*  But I do drink bone broth every day. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9804.44s)]
*  Me too. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9806.16s)]
*  Yeah, I buy kettle and fire. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9807.32s)]
*  I get a lot of that stuff, and I drink bone broth pretty much [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9809.28s)]
*  at least once or not twice a day. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9812.76s)]
*  I don't know how much this duck pork repair is going on. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9814.24s)]
*  It says fire in the ducks. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9815.92s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9817.08s)]
*  So I think the plan is so they have one of those things. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9818.28s)]
*  That's a Grill Works grill. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9821.76s)]
*  I have one of those at home. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9823.92s)]
*  They're the shit. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9824.96s)]
*  That's the same kind of grill that they have at my favorite [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9825.92s)]
*  restaurant in Vegas, which is Bizarre Meats, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9828.32s)]
*  this incredible steakhouse. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9831.08s)]
*  They have live fire going on. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9833.48s)]
*  The steaks are on these Argentine grills. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9835.24s)]
*  Do you know what those are? [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9837.52s)]
*  Well, you crank it so it raises and lowers. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9838.52s)]
*  So they start the steaks up very high. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9840.92s)]
*  So they slowly bring them up to temperature [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9843.0s)]
*  and then lower it down as the meat gets. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9844.92s)]
*  And then they sear it over the fire. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9847.28s)]
*  I'm really trying to learn. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9850.24s)]
*  I'm learning how to cook steaks better. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9851.44s)]
*  It's such an art. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9856.12s)]
*  I can give you some tips. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9857.08s)]
*  I'm pretty good at that shit. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9858.2s)]
*  I think you can. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9859.400000000001s)]
*  That's my thing. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9860.0s)]
*  Where are you on the egg, the green egg? [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9860.92s)]
*  You can. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9863.04s)]
*  You could definitely use a green egg. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9863.560000000001s)]
*  They're great. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9864.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a Kamado type grill. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9866.12s)]
*  I used to have one. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9868.76s)]
*  Not a green egg, but it was a Kamado, a company called, [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9869.640000000001s)]
*  I think it's called Kamado Kamada. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9872.800000000001s)]
*  But they make these really cool ones, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9875.52s)]
*  like super artistic, beautiful tile on the outside of them. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9878.24s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9881.92s)]
*  Yeah, I left it at one of my houses when I sold the house. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9882.6s)]
*  Because I had to take out my grill in the house [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9885.560000000001s)]
*  I live in in California, because any kind of meat, the coyotes, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9888.36s)]
*  I would wake up, coyotes would just [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9892.16s)]
*  be standing on the grill in the morning. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9893.48s)]
*  So it's like, I need something I can bring in the garage [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9894.880000000001s)]
*  and then roll them out. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9896.800000000001s)]
*  It's called a 22 with subsonic ammo. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9897.6s)]
*  I know, I did. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9900.52s)]
*  I did. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9901.32s)]
*  Kam Haines was like, I'll come take care of that in two seconds. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9902.720000000001s)]
*  But you want to be able to shoot multiple times. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9906.16s)]
*  The problem with bows and arrows is it just [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9908.039999999999s)]
*  takes too long to reload. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9909.56s)]
*  You can get one, but with subsonic ammo, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9910.6s)]
*  they don't even know what the fuck happened. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9914.24s)]
*  They just get popped. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9916.0s)]
*  But also, it's whack-a-mole with them. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9917.0s)]
*  You can't kill them, right? [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9918.8s)]
*  You're never going to eradicate them. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9919.84s)]
*  In fact, it's even worse, because when you kill coyotes, [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9922.0s)]
*  when they yell out at night, like, hey, hey, hey, hey, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9924.76s)]
*  they're kind of doing roll call. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9927.6s)]
*  And when one of the coyotes shows up missing, [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9929.68s)]
*  the female coyote will have more babies. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9932.359999999999s)]
*  She'll make a hormone to just make more pups. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9934.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9936.519999999999s)]
*  There's a great book about coyotes called Coyote America [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9937.0s)]
*  that my friend Dan Flores wrote. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9940.039999999999s)]
*  And it's fantastic. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9941.84s)]
*  And it just details how unusual they are [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9943.68s)]
*  and how they evolved to be that way, [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9946.519999999999s)]
*  because they were being killed by wolves in the West. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9948.439999999999s)]
*  They're in every city in the country. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9951.76s)]
*  Every city. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9953.64s)]
*  They're in New York. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9954.16s)]
*  They're in Central Park. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9954.8s)]
*  Yep. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9955.439999999999s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9955.8s)]
*  They're so cunning. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9956.56s)]
*  Have you seen the video of the guy on a boat [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9957.72s)]
*  and there's a coyote swimming in the water, [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9959.56s)]
*  and he reaches down and grabs it by the back of its neck? [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9961.08s)]
*  No. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9963.6s)]
*  Where is this? [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9964.1s)]
*  I just watched it yesterday. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9964.880000000001s)]
*  I had it on Instagram. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9966.84s)]
*  You could probably find it, Jamie. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9968.04s)]
*  If not, I might have it saved. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9969.48s)]
*  It doesn't seem like they have rabies that often, though. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9971.24s)]
*  Oh, they have. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9973.6s)]
*  They do? [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9974.16s)]
*  I'm sure they have rabies. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9974.68s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9975.92s)]
*  They probably have everything. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9976.68s)]
*  They do seem fearless. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9977.720000000001s)]
*  I will have to chase one. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9979.08s)]
*  I go after it. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9980.32s)]
*  They look at you. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9980.92s)]
*  They're mocking you. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9981.6s)]
*  They're not scared of you. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9982.48s)]
*  They'll attack your kids. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9983.44s)]
*  That's a really scary one. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9984.6s)]
*  There was one carried a kid off in Arizona off of a porch. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9985.800000000001s)]
*  Someone put their baby carrier down, went right for it. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9992.36s)]
*  They don't give a shit. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9994.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's food to them. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9995.48s)]
*  They don't think of it as your kid. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9996.960000000001s)]
*  There's also something vulnerable. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=9999.16s)]
*  The owls have really gotten brazen. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10001.84s)]
*  I've got these dog toys. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10004.16s)]
*  I have pit bulls, so I have these like, [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10005.68s)]
*  it looks like a fake squirrel or whatever. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10007.32s)]
*  I'm like, where are all the toys? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10009.28s)]
*  And there's a tree right behind my house, [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10010.56s)]
*  and all of the dog toys are just hanging. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10012.380000000001s)]
*  It's like some Blair Witch Project shit. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10015.08s)]
*  They just pick them up. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10016.84s)]
*  That's a different one. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10019.32s)]
*  That guy found one that was in the lake. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10020.68s)]
*  When I was looking it up, there's [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10023.44s)]
*  a video from every year from the last few years, one [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10025.12s)]
*  in Martha's Vineyard. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10027.16s)]
*  They were finding it, this one in New York City. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10028.56s)]
*  So it's not a dog. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10031.48s)]
*  OK, so did it try to bite them? [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10032.68s)]
*  Says he's now in the care of veterinarians. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10035.4s)]
*  Yeah, that means euthanasia. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10038.32s)]
*  They're swimming in the East River. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10040.12s)]
*  Biscayne Bay, Ocean. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10042.24s)]
*  That's in Florida. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10044.32s)]
*  New York's East River. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10046.48s)]
*  Did you Google? [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10047.44s)]
*  What are they doing? [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10048.800000000001s)]
*  Guy grabs coyote from boat. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10050.76s)]
*  Boaters tries to find one the dead of night. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10058.4s)]
*  This happens at Maryland, which specifically, [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10060.4s)]
*  I mean, if it's on Instagram. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10062.72s)]
*  That's the Woodland Hills one. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10063.8s)]
*  The coyote attacked a toddler in Woodland Hills. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10064.8s)]
*  That one right there with the pink, oh, Jesus. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10067.76s)]
*  Yeah, that one's fucked. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10070.16s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10071.4s)]
*  Just dragging the baby across. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10072.4s)]
*  That's like a five-year-old. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10074.119999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10075.56s)]
*  No, not quite that old, but that's scary, man. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10076.359999999999s)]
*  How is the parent not seeing that this is happening? [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10079.76s)]
*  They didn't hear it. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10081.56s)]
*  They were on the other side of the car. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10082.56s)]
*  Yeah, fuck, man. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10084.199999999999s)]
*  Right there. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10085.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10086.16s)]
*  Things dragging your kid away. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10087.679999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10089.4s)]
*  So scary. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10089.92s)]
*  And then your kid just is horrified now. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10091.359999999999s)]
*  They literally almost got eaten. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10093.96s)]
*  A friend of mine was walking with her dog up in the hills. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10095.359999999999s)]
*  Coyote comes up, kind of stalking them, chases them away, [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10102.0s)]
*  keeps walking, turns around 15 minutes later. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10105.72s)]
*  Six coyotes had gone and got his friend, came back, [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10109.12s)]
*  because they'll try to surround him. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10113.039999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10115.12s)]
*  Because my dogs will fight him, but if it's one of my dogs [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10115.68s)]
*  and six or seven surround him, and what they want to do [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10118.92s)]
*  is I got this coyote guy comes over to say, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10121.16s)]
*  you've got to get the rollers to put in the fencing, [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10123.64s)]
*  because they can jump. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10126.2s)]
*  They're vampires, so you've got to put these rollers on the top. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10127.56s)]
*  So they jump and roll. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10129.64s)]
*  Jump and roll. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10131.16s)]
*  And then you've got to go, I think [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10131.92s)]
*  it's like three or four feet into the ground or something, [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10132.8s)]
*  because they'll come under. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10135.32s)]
*  And he goes, because I'm like, oh, well, I'll hear it. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10136.44s)]
*  He's like, no, you won't hear it, [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10138.84s)]
*  because the way the coyotes bait dogs is first [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10140.44s)]
*  they'll play with them. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10142.68s)]
*  First they'll play with them, and then their friends [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10143.960000000001s)]
*  will come down and surround them, [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10145.800000000001s)]
*  or they'll make the dog chase them to wear them out, [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10147.04s)]
*  and then just take them back to the den. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10151.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've told this story before, [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10153.4s)]
*  but there was a guy that I used to, [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10154.68s)]
*  he worked at a pet food store that I used to go to, [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10156.48s)]
*  and he also worked at a veterinarian's clinic, [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10158.48s)]
*  and they had a dog come in. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10160.28s)]
*  It's a big pit bull. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10161.800000000001s)]
*  It's a big muscular pit bull, and it was covered with scars. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10162.960000000001s)]
*  His whole body got stitched up, hundreds of stitches. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10166.04s)]
*  And the guy brought it in. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10169.16s)]
*  He's like, I don't know what happened. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10170.48s)]
*  He got out of the fence, and this is how I found him. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10172.88s)]
*  So this guy follows a blood trail [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10175.0s)]
*  that his dog left behind up into the hills, [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10176.68s)]
*  where he finds nine dead coyotes. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10178.84s)]
*  He said it looked like Vietnam. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10182.56s)]
*  Yep. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10184.08s)]
*  He said it was just like Saving Private Ryan or something. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10184.96s)]
*  It was just dead coyotes everywhere. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10187.04s)]
*  I just picked the wrong dog. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10189.2s)]
*  That's it. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10190.28s)]
*  Wrong dog. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10190.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10191.8s)]
*  Wrong dog. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10192.2s)]
*  That's how mine are. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10192.68s)]
*  I just don't want them to get rabies or anything like that. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10193.4s)]
*  They make those giant pit bulls, where people just breed them [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10196.56s)]
*  larger and larger and larger. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10199.68s)]
*  And they're fearless. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10201.519999999999s)]
*  They're not afraid of pain at all. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10203.039999999999s)]
*  And so a fight is fun for them. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10205.56s)]
*  They're wagging their tail. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10207.519999999999s)]
*  And that's what all their skins for. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10208.4s)]
*  Yeah, all that extra skin. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10209.16s)]
*  But it's also their pain tolerance [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10211.56s)]
*  is fucking extraordinary, because they [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10213.039999999999s)]
*  are bred that way. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10215.519999999999s)]
*  It's also crazy when you think bulldogs and stuff, right? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10216.56s)]
*  They were bred to fight bulls to the death, [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10219.48s)]
*  and that's what all those wrinkles are for, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10221.4s)]
*  so that the blood would drain down. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10222.76s)]
*  Is that what it's for? [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10224.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10225.16s)]
*  I just thought they just raised them tough. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10226.64s)]
*  They'd have bull baiting, where they'd have a bull chained up, [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10228.4s)]
*  and then the dogs would attack the bull. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10231.44s)]
*  And that was bear baiting. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10233.92s)]
*  They used to do it with bears. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10235.0s)]
*  They'd sick dogs on bears. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10236.039999999999s)]
*  That was just entertainment back then. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10237.4s)]
*  You would just watch that fight go on and on and on. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10238.72s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't have Instagram. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10240.32s)]
*  You didn't have a good algorithm. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10241.48s)]
*  We were never, human nature-wise, we were never [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10242.68s)]
*  particularly moral creatures, I was going to say. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10246.48s)]
*  I feel like this is our- [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10250.4s)]
*  We're better now than ever. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10251.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10252.72s)]
*  This is the best case scenario in terms [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10253.22s)]
*  of what we're seeing happen. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10255.06s)]
*  And we're still insanely tribal. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10257.179999999998s)]
*  And you're seeing these fights break out, [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10259.26s)]
*  these Israel-Palestine protests, and some old man in LA [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10260.8s)]
*  got beaten to death the other day. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10264.42s)]
*  They hit him over the head with a microphone, [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10266.3s)]
*  internally hemorrhaged and died. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10268.66s)]
*  That guy needs to drink some of the LA water, [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10270.939999999999s)]
*  get that fentanyl in the system, and chill out. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10272.939999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10274.9s)]
*  In my brain, maybe I'm just trying to get out of it. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10275.46s)]
*  I'm like, that person must be on drugs. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10277.06s)]
*  That person's on drugs. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10278.46s)]
*  Or are people just this riled up by? [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10279.42s)]
*  People are riled up. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10281.5s)]
*  They feel like it's something they're supposed to do. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10283.34s)]
*  And whenever there's a cause, like free Palestine [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10285.54s)]
*  or free Ukraine, or whatever the fucking cause is- [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10288.94s)]
*  They feel justified. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10291.26s)]
*  People feel justified in doing horrific things [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10292.02s)]
*  to other people because they're on the right side. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10294.86s)]
*  And that is one of the things that is literally [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10297.34s)]
*  what the Hamas did to the Israelis. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10300.7s)]
*  That's what the Nazis did to the Jews. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10303.26s)]
*  It's what people have done forever [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10306.060000000001s)]
*  when they can other a different group. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10307.54s)]
*  And it's also what the Israelis have [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10309.62s)]
*  done to some of the Palestinians, too. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10311.94s)]
*  They other groups. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10313.78s)]
*  You can turn a group into some non-humans [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10316.060000000001s)]
*  that are your enemy, some orcs. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10318.7s)]
*  Just reduce them to objectify. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10321.34s)]
*  It seems like be a part of how human beings existed [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10324.58s)]
*  and thrived in tribes. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10329.460000000001s)]
*  You almost had to develop that sort of skill [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10331.380000000001s)]
*  because if you didn't, you'd be attacked by other tribes, [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10333.460000000001s)]
*  and you wouldn't be able to handle the situation. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10336.1s)]
*  You would make a mistake and treat [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10339.300000000001s)]
*  them like another person, and they would kill you. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10341.3s)]
*  And then you wouldn't live, and then they [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10343.5s)]
*  would kill your family. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10344.98s)]
*  And it's like people had to develop this ability [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10345.98s)]
*  to be horrific to the others. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10348.619999999999s)]
*  I go back to my dad used to manage a hotel in West [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10350.9s)]
*  Virginia, Hilltop House, where the Civil War started. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10354.619999999999s)]
*  And I go to these Civil War. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10357.74s)]
*  Some happens when you turn 40, or maybe [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10359.5s)]
*  where you get obsessed with the Civil War and Hitler. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10361.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10363.58s)]
*  Can't get enough Civil War stuff right now. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10364.22s)]
*  And you're like, it was so recently [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10366.539999999999s)]
*  that we were just fighting each other with swords. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10368.66s)]
*  In fields. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10371.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, so recently. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10372.380000000001s)]
*  That was so recent. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10373.42s)]
*  I just had this guy on, Elliot West. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10374.5s)]
*  He wrote this book, Continental Reckoning, [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10376.460000000001s)]
*  The American Rest in the Age of Expansion. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10378.7s)]
*  This fucking incredible book. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10381.26s)]
*  And he's just an incredible guy, but he's [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10383.42s)]
*  talking about all the things that [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10385.98s)]
*  happened when people settled in America [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10387.7s)]
*  and made their way across the country in the expansion [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10390.82s)]
*  and what the horrific consequences were. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10393.9s)]
*  Also, there's something, and I know I always bring this up [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10395.9s)]
*  with you, the Calcio Storico thing. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10398.220000000001s)]
*  When that fight happens in Italy, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10401.1s)]
*  violence goes basically down to zero. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10403.619999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10405.9s)]
*  And it's like, isn't, I mean, if MMA didn't exist, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10406.38s)]
*  I'm sure there would be so much more violence. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10408.98s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10411.5s)]
*  The catharsis of it. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10412.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, that was one of the reasons [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10413.18s)]
*  why they invented football. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10414.539999999999s)]
*  They invented football as like a substitute for war. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10416.019999999999s)]
*  Just to get it out of your system. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10418.98s)]
*  You give someone something to compete against that [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10420.46s)]
*  isn't killing each other. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10423.019999999999s)]
*  Because human beings have been killing each other [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10423.98s)]
*  in competition forever. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10426.26s)]
*  It was the part when you grew up you wanted to be a soldier. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10427.699999999999s)]
*  When you grew up, you wanted to fight for your country. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10430.42s)]
*  It was noble. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10432.38s)]
*  And when you needed to fight off the enemy, [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10433.18s)]
*  you wanted to raise a kid that was a soldier. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10435.86s)]
*  So it became a part of what it meant to be a male human [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10438.54s)]
*  being growing up. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10442.58s)]
*  And part of the Second Amendment is [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10443.86s)]
*  about being part of the volunteer infantry, right? [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10445.86s)]
*  Well, it's to maintain a militia. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10449.26s)]
*  And the idea of the militia originally [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10452.5s)]
*  was to fight off a tyrannical government. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10454.78s)]
*  I mean, it was literally what got us here [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10457.82s)]
*  to this point. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10460.06s)]
*  They moved to America to escape the tyranny of England. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10461.06s)]
*  They got here and they said, we must have the right [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10466.06s)]
*  to keep and bear arms because the first thing a tyrant is [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10469.38s)]
*  going to do is disarm the population. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10471.779999999999s)]
*  Because then they can't rise up and then they [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10474.34s)]
*  can't have a well-armed militia. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10476.019999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting because I was talking to someone [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10478.38s)]
*  recently about the history of stand up in America [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10480.38s)]
*  and it being different than what the court jester's job was. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10483.3s)]
*  Stand up is uniquely American, like hip hop, right? [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10487.699999999999s)]
*  Uniquely American invention, not that old. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10490.699999999999s)]
*  Whereas the court jester, people are like, [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10493.699999999999s)]
*  no, there's been the court jester. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10495.22s)]
*  This is a different thing. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10496.42s)]
*  The court jester's job was to deliver bad news to the king, [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10497.46s)]
*  but also to make fun of the king. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10501.26s)]
*  And if the king didn't laugh, the idea [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10503.5s)]
*  was power had corrupted his brain in some way [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10505.699999999999s)]
*  and he was a problem. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10508.34s)]
*  Because it's like power corrupts. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10510.58s)]
*  Well, they just wanted someone like Brian Kalin [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10512.58s)]
*  around, just constantly crack jokes. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10514.5s)]
*  You know, you need someone like that. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10518.22s)]
*  There's just always cracking jokes. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10520.14s)]
*  Just always on. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10521.98s)]
*  Always just being a pigeon for no reason. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10523.179999999998s)]
*  If I was a king, I'd be bored as fuck. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10526.58s)]
*  Someone feeding me grapes. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10528.26s)]
*  Someone dance for me. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10529.539999999999s)]
*  Like have gout. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10531.46s)]
*  You can't walk. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10532.699999999999s)]
*  You know, the Lakotas had something called the Heyoka. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10533.9s)]
*  Heyoka was a sacred clown. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10536.74s)]
*  And the idea was that you had to have one member of society [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10538.699999999999s)]
*  that made fun of everything, the greatest warrior, the queen, [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10541.46s)]
*  whatever the fuck it was. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10544.779999999999s)]
*  Because if you couldn't make fun of something, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10546.14s)]
*  it was bullshit. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10547.58s)]
*  Yep. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10548.38s)]
*  Yeah, if you couldn't make fun of something, [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10550.019999999999s)]
*  you couldn't talk about something, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10551.66s)]
*  that thing was like, why can't you? [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10552.859999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10554.5s)]
*  Like, what is it about that thing? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10555.019999999999s)]
*  That thing might be corrupted. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10556.619999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10557.9s)]
*  And they realized that that was a weakness in their society [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10558.46s)]
*  if they had a thing that had that kind of power where [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10561.099999999999s)]
*  it couldn't be made of fun of. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10563.779999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10565.82s)]
*  It's like, it's wild. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10566.98s)]
*  Like, don't you find being a comedian right now, [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10568.099999999999s)]
*  people are like, we need you more than ever. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10569.98s)]
*  And I'm like, we're just making jokes. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10572.019999999999s)]
*  Like, what happened that we became these bravery warriors? [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10573.94s)]
*  Social media, attacks, canceling, censoring. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10578.980000000001s)]
*  There's so many things. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10583.62s)]
*  It's like live comedy in a club, especially in a club like ours, [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10584.58s)]
*  that you take away the ability to use your phone. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10588.82s)]
*  Everybody's phone's in a bag. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10591.62s)]
*  It changes everything. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10593.02s)]
*  It changes everything. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10594.58s)]
*  And it makes it this like what it used to be, [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10595.5s)]
*  which is this free speech sort of art form where you can fuck [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10598.140000000001s)]
*  around and say a bunch of outrageous shit [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10602.78s)]
*  in anywhere else that gets you in trouble in our culture [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10605.26s)]
*  more than ever before. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10607.900000000001s)]
*  People are getting fired for not even [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10609.86s)]
*  that controversial opinions. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10611.86s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10613.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10614.18s)]
*  I mean, after the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing, [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10615.220000000001s)]
*  Chappelle at the Hollywood Ball, there was. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10619.140000000001s)]
*  And again, maybe this is just cameras are catching it, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10622.140000000001s)]
*  and this has always kind of happened. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10624.380000000001s)]
*  But I think we would have heard about it. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10625.58s)]
*  We knew when Jim Jefferies got a guy ran up on stage [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10626.62s)]
*  and punched him. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10629.62s)]
*  That was a while ago. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10630.26s)]
*  But after the Chappelle Hollywood Ball thing, [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10631.54s)]
*  it was like Kim Congdon got physically [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10634.02s)]
*  assaulted after she opened for Joey Diaz somewhere. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10636.380000000001s)]
*  That was that girl, Ariel, Alia? [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10638.78s)]
*  I can't. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10641.78s)]
*  Sorry, I don't know her last name. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10642.300000000001s)]
*  But someone threw a beer can right at her head [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10643.300000000001s)]
*  when she was on stage. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10645.460000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10646.580000000002s)]
*  A lot of crazy shit. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10647.5s)]
*  And then there was a girl that was, [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10648.62s)]
*  I think I tweeted it ages ago. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10650.62s)]
*  I don't really do much to ex. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10652.060000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10653.34s)]
*  Someone flipped a table at her while she was on stage. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10654.820000000002s)]
*  It was just like some bar show. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10657.220000000001s)]
*  It's just wild to think that people [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10659.42s)]
*  would get that pissed off about a comedian saying something. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10662.22s)]
*  Well, I also think that people are just generally [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10664.74s)]
*  more pissed off now. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10666.86s)]
*  The economy sucks. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10668.02s)]
*  No one really recovered from COVID that well. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10670.42s)]
*  Psychologically, people didn't recover from it that well. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10673.18s)]
*  And some people financially are ruined forever. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10675.5s)]
*  Imagine how bitter you'd be if you had a job that your family [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10677.74s)]
*  worked for 30 years, and then these shithead politicians just [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10680.22s)]
*  decided you weren't an essential business, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10683.98s)]
*  and you guys lost everything, and you can't rebound. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10686.380000000001s)]
*  You can't get a loan. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10689.14s)]
*  There's no way to restart. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10690.82s)]
*  The number of, I think it was like 80% of restaurants, [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10692.099999999999s)]
*  at least in California, closed. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10695.22s)]
*  It's somewhere around there. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10696.779999999999s)]
*  It was 70 at one time. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10697.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10699.06s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10700.539999999999s)]
*  What they did was fucking insane. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10701.019999999999s)]
*  But they didn't do it here. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10703.18s)]
*  No, they didn't do it here. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10704.58s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why I came here. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10705.98s)]
*  The fact that Gavin Newsom, this American psycho-ass, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10707.82s)]
*  botoxed, smithers, the fact that he was just [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10710.699999999999s)]
*  able to get away with this is wild. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10713.939999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what our taxes even pay for at this point. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10718.34s)]
*  His wife's legal bills with Harvey Weinstein? [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10720.7s)]
*  Well, when you are in a state like California [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10723.380000000001s)]
*  that is blue no matter who, you can get away with murder. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10725.74s)]
*  Because it's just a matter of who the party chooses [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10730.1s)]
*  to be in that position, and what kind of nonsense [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10732.26s)]
*  and propaganda they're going to use [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10734.9s)]
*  to justify all of the decisions that they made, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10736.5s)]
*  what kind of revisionist history. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10740.86s)]
*  Well, we made some mistakes. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10742.42s)]
*  He did a lot more than that. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10744.34s)]
*  He mandated a fucking experimental vaccine [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10746.22s)]
*  for children to be able to go to school. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10748.3s)]
*  There's even these, have you seen the little robot food [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10749.98s)]
*  delivery guys? [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10753.019999999999s)]
*  They're called Cocos. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10754.58s)]
*  It's a little cooler on wheels that delivers food [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10756.3s)]
*  to your house. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10759.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10760.42s)]
*  You couldn't even let the people that [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10760.939999999999s)]
*  lost their jobs that are now DoorDash guys and Postmates, [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10762.34s)]
*  but you couldn't even let them have a job. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10764.9s)]
*  You know? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10767.259999999998s)]
*  I guess they don't give a fuck about that. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10768.9s)]
*  They just care about their own business. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10770.58s)]
*  It's hard enough. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10772.58s)]
*  It's a mess out there. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10774.779999999999s)]
*  It's a mess out there, and it'll probably get a lot better. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10776.38s)]
*  It's certainly not what it was at the turn of the century. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10780.619999999999s)]
*  Like I was talking about the Dissolving Illusions book [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10783.259999999998s)]
*  when they're talking about New York City in 1900. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10785.3s)]
*  Fucking horrible. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10787.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10788.939999999999s)]
*  Gangs of New York. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10790.06s)]
*  Think of that kind of shit. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10790.939999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's way better now, but it's still a mess. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10792.3s)]
*  And it's technically the third Industrial Revolution, right? [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10795.099999999999s)]
*  Like, do a lot of people historically [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10797.9s)]
*  get put out of jobs when every time there's [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10799.42s)]
*  an Industrial Revolution, and then it reorganizes? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10801.179999999998s)]
*  That makes sense. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10803.5s)]
*  But the problem with this is also AI. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10804.46s)]
*  We might become obsolete. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10806.74s)]
*  We very well could become obsolete. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10808.859999999999s)]
*  That's a real thing that people don't want to think about. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10810.259999999998s)]
*  But we could all become obsolete, other than maybe artists. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10812.74s)]
*  Some artists can survive, but then even digital art [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10817.38s)]
*  is doing things where they're making versions. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10821.699999999999s)]
*  Like I was talking to Molly Crabapple about this. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10824.3s)]
*  She's a super talented artist that's [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10826.38s)]
*  been on the podcast before, and she's [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10828.099999999999s)]
*  ranted quite a bit about AI in the early days. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10830.9s)]
*  She's like, they're stealing people's art. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10833.82s)]
*  Because even if they're not stealing your image, [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10836.38s)]
*  what they're doing is they're sort of siphoning up [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10839.58s)]
*  all of your artwork. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10843.66s)]
*  And then someone says, make a painting [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10845.14s)]
*  in the style of Molly Crabapple, and it can just do it. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10847.9s)]
*  And it would be a painting like she would do. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10851.34s)]
*  But it's digital, and it looks awesome. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10853.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10855.46s)]
*  I mean, we showed a bunch of these Alex Gray images [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10855.98s)]
*  that they've done through AI. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10859.699999999999s)]
*  You know what Alex Gray is? [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10861.02s)]
*  I think I've heard this episode. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10862.38s)]
*  Psychedelic artist. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10863.66s)]
*  He's been on the podcast a couple times as well. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10864.699999999999s)]
*  Really, really fascinating guy and fascinating artwork. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10866.859999999999s)]
*  But they did AI versions of his artwork, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10871.539999999999s)]
*  and it's just as good, if not better. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10874.3s)]
*  It's fucking incredible. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10875.9s)]
*  I mean, this is like I was used to be obsessed with Jean [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10876.9s)]
*  Baudrillard, like the simulacra. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10878.98s)]
*  He wrote about how, you know, French philosopher, [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10880.539999999999s)]
*  about how we actually prefer the fake to the original. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10882.66s)]
*  You know, it's like Vegas. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10885.939999999999s)]
*  Like how we just prefer the simulacra to the original. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10887.22s)]
*  We prefer a cherry starburst to an actual cherry, [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10889.74s)]
*  when you start to like how far gone you end up being. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10893.619999999999s)]
*  But in terms of the California thing, [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10897.539999999999s)]
*  something that does drive me nuts, [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10899.26s)]
*  it's like no one has a job in California except children. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10901.619999999999s)]
*  Child acting is still legal. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10904.3s)]
*  Like children are the only ones that work. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10905.94s)]
*  Why are children still showing up? [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10907.66s)]
*  Not only that, like kids who get jobs when they're young, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10909.1s)]
*  at least they learn how to work, and they learn work ethic. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10912.66s)]
*  Child actors just become fucked up. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10916.3s)]
*  Why are we using CGI kids or midgets or something? [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10920.460000000001s)]
*  It is so wild to me that, and I got in trouble [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10924.26s)]
*  for saying this about the Sound of Freedom movie, [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10927.02s)]
*  because it's like, yes, obviously that movie had to get made [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10928.7s)]
*  and we need to talk about that more, [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10930.42s)]
*  but why are you putting child actors in a movie [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10932.660000000002s)]
*  about how to not treat children? [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10935.78s)]
*  Like it drives me insane. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10937.78s)]
*  Right, and they're getting treated poorly in the movie. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10939.34s)]
*  Yeah, well it's like these kids, [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10941.220000000001s)]
*  like do they know what they're doing? [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10942.380000000001s)]
*  Do they know the subject matter of this? [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10943.62s)]
*  Well, not only that, you're making a kid famous. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10944.94s)]
*  That's right. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10947.34s)]
*  You're making a kid famous, you're ruining that kid. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10948.18s)]
*  For being a child trafficked kid. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10949.9s)]
*  Right, like what are the odds of a kid getting famous [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10951.94s)]
*  when they're young and coming out okay? [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10955.14s)]
*  It's almost like 99% they're not going to. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10956.9s)]
*  They would have to find something very unusual [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10961.06s)]
*  that they did that gave them center and balance. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10963.94s)]
*  Yeah, I even get creeped out when I go into the, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10966.98s)]
*  to send like a meme or something, [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10970.14s)]
*  and there's like a little girl on a tutu. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10971.62s)]
*  I'm like, who's this kid? [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10973.5s)]
*  Like why, I mean, I guess it comes from that, [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10974.98s)]
*  the toddlers in tiaras, those shows [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10977.580000000002s)]
*  where they're making kids pageant girls or something. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10979.42s)]
*  But I'm like, what are all these memes? [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10981.580000000002s)]
*  Even the girl in the back seat who's like making the face. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10983.220000000001s)]
*  I'm like, who's children are these? [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10985.740000000002s)]
*  Do they still do those things? [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10986.580000000002s)]
*  Cause one time we were here, [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10988.460000000001s)]
*  we were doing the Addison improv. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10989.7s)]
*  It was me and Joey Diaz and Duncan. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10991.140000000001s)]
*  Love that club. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10993.42s)]
*  And we were walking through this hotel lobby [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10994.26s)]
*  and we saw all these little girls [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10997.34s)]
*  in like skirts and high heels and made up. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=10999.980000000001s)]
*  And there was a child beauty pageant going on. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11003.26s)]
*  Nope, no. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11005.86s)]
*  And it's bizarre. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11007.06s)]
*  I'm gonna say it. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11011.619999999999s)]
*  There was, I wanna say a couple of years ago [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11012.539999999999s)]
*  on a magazine, I think it was People Magazine, [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11015.779999999999s)]
*  they had, this would have been [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11019.66s)]
*  John Benet Ramsey's 18th birthday. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11021.779999999999s)]
*  Why is that a cover? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11025.66s)]
*  Why are we, and I guess someone told me [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11027.02s)]
*  there was some kind of like Reddit, [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11029.94s)]
*  not Reddit, I'm sorry, [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11033.699999999999s)]
*  deep 4chan about when John Benet Ramsey, [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11035.22s)]
*  like a countdown of when she would have turned 18. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11038.38s)]
*  Oh God. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11040.58s)]
*  And you're like, why are we looking at this girl again? [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11041.42s)]
*  Why is she still on the cover of magazines? [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11044.46s)]
*  And they never found out who killed her, right? [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11046.82s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the answer. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11049.74s)]
*  Nobody got arrested. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11054.539999999999s)]
*  It wasn't the dad or something? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11055.38s)]
*  The daughter was the mom. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11057.34s)]
*  But then also, the whole thing also just spooks me. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11058.179999999998s)]
*  I don't even wanna look into it [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11060.98s)]
*  cause I once watched a documentary about John Benet Ramsey [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11062.22s)]
*  and they were like, oh, they found that when she was dead, [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11064.54s)]
*  her vagina was twice the size of a normal five-year-old's. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11067.060000000001s)]
*  And you're like, well, how did you know the normal size? [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11071.1s)]
*  Like how? [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11074.060000000001s)]
*  Well, I know anatomy. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11074.900000000001s)]
*  I know, I just was like. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11075.720000000001s)]
*  But yeah, there was evidence that she had been penetrated. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11076.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11080.460000000001s)]
*  And I was talking to Duncan about this, [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11081.300000000001s)]
*  about how these mom influencers on TikTok, [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11082.84s)]
*  will have like, I'm giving my kid bath time [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11087.62s)]
*  and we're doing it with this, whatever, [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11090.300000000001s)]
*  Johnson & Johnson shampoo, Peyton Partnership, [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11091.660000000002s)]
*  whatever they, mom influencers. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11093.54s)]
*  And you'll see, oh, there's 50,000 plays of this video, [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11096.900000000001s)]
*  but there's 2000 downloads. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11100.240000000002s)]
*  Why are? [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11103.060000000001s)]
*  Why are you downloading a kid getting a shower? [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11104.220000000001s)]
*  And why are you allowing people to download these videos [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11106.02s)]
*  off TikTok of your kid? [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11109.300000000001s)]
*  I don't like the downloads. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11111.580000000002s)]
*  Well, the whole thing is weird. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11112.900000000001s)]
*  Exposing your kids to the world like that seems crazy. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11114.5s)]
*  And the fact that people do it for money [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11117.740000000002s)]
*  and that there's like these influencers [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11119.820000000002s)]
*  that use their family and their kids [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11121.460000000001s)]
*  to start this business where they're exposing [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11124.02s)]
*  their kids to the world, you know? [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11125.2s)]
*  Fine, I won't have my baby live on OnlyFans. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11127.92s)]
*  Fine. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11131.880000000001s)]
*  Is there a stigma to doing OnlyFans TV [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11133.400000000001s)]
*  because of OnlyFans, the thing? [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11135.94s)]
*  People kind of go like, uh oh, am I gonna, [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11137.880000000001s)]
*  but it's a totally separate thing. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11139.68s)]
*  Right, but it's got the same name. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11141.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it does. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11142.720000000001s)]
*  But I think, you know, I look back and I just go like, [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11144.0s)]
*  you know what, we're at a time where it's like, [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11146.04s)]
*  Comedy Central doesn't exist. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11147.12s)]
*  This special that I'm doing, it was, [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11148.76s)]
*  I had done five stand-up specials [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11151.0s)]
*  and I realized that every time I did a special, [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11153.76s)]
*  I would start another special after I did one. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11156.44s)]
*  Instead of just going like, let me just be free [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11159.52s)]
*  and write what I wanna write. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11161.4s)]
*  Let me just like not censor myself. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11162.96s)]
*  I'd be like, oh, I probably can't talk about that [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11164.44s)]
*  or, oh, this probably won't be topical in a year. [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11165.96s)]
*  So I was like catering what I was writing [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11170.24s)]
*  to the idea of shooting a special in a year [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11172.72s)]
*  and I was like, this creatively is just not what I, [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11174.8s)]
*  the way I wanna be functioning now. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11177.38s)]
*  So I just wrote like crazy shit that would only be done [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11179.16s)]
*  on the road or in the clubs. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11181.800000000001s)]
*  And basically they're like, [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11183.76s)]
*  do you wanna do a special here? [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11186.12s)]
*  We're gonna start doing stand-up specials. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11187.18s)]
*  They're gonna start doing like half hours, [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11188.52s)]
*  you know, totally uncensored, no notes. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11190.04s)]
*  I had done the roasts with them. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11191.82s)]
*  They let us do anything. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11193.36s)]
*  I mean, it was like, we did the Rose de Bourg Chrysler. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11195.32s)]
*  My favorite joke might be Tony Hinchcliffe to Jim Norton. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11197.64s)]
*  He goes, Jim Norton likes to have sex with trans women [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11201.32s)]
*  cause he's gay. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11208.4s)]
*  I mean, shit that like you would just get dinged [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11209.84s)]
*  if you did it anywhere else. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11216.960000000001s)]
*  Like they were just so awesome about it. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11218.26s)]
*  We need more platforms like that. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11220.24s)]
*  That's for sure. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11221.68s)]
*  I'm not anti-only fans at all. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11222.8s)]
*  And I think, like I said, if I was a young girl, [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11224.8s)]
*  I would do that before I'd work at Walmart. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11226.84s)]
*  I have zero problem with it. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11228.8s)]
*  I just think it could be potentially a trap [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11231.08s)]
*  if you're a person that wants to do something else eventually. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11235.28s)]
*  Yeah, but so the subscription is totally separate [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11238.279999999999s)]
*  from the TV network, you know? [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11240.92s)]
*  So the TV network, they're trying to do comedy. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11242.759999999998s)]
*  It's like a lot of fitness people, cooking people. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11244.859999999999s)]
*  I think you and Matt Reif had talked about it. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11247.519999999999s)]
*  So it's just OF.TV and it's free and totally uncensored. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11249.34s)]
*  So you don't have to pay for it. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11252.4s)]
*  That's great too. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11254.08s)]
*  And at a time where you're like, [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11254.9s)]
*  it's kind of like Netflix or nothing at this point. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11255.779999999999s)]
*  And I was like, if I put 30 minutes of trans [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11257.92s)]
*  and drag queen story hour jokes on Netflix, [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11260.599999999999s)]
*  I feel like I probably get a ton of heat. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11262.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11264.8s)]
*  So it was kind of like, it feels like if you're [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11265.62s)]
*  going to OnlyFans TV, you're already down for comedy. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11268.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11273.42s)]
*  That's great. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11274.78s)]
*  No, it's great they're doing roasts. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11275.42s)]
*  It's great they're doing comedy specials. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11276.660000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like there's only a few uncensored platforms [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11278.42s)]
*  that are available now. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11281.660000000002s)]
*  Rumble's one of them. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11282.58s)]
*  You can kind of do whatever you want on Rumble. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11283.62s)]
*  Yeah, but I feel like it's not, you know. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11285.220000000001s)]
*  It's not as mainstream, but it's certainly growing. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11288.060000000001s)]
*  But think about how long it took for YouTube to become YouTube. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11290.380000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11293.26s)]
*  And as there's more restrictions put on YouTube, [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11293.9s)]
*  I think things like Rumble will probably grow. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11296.42s)]
*  And as more content creators move over to Rumble, [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11299.22s)]
*  it'll probably grow. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11302.42s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11303.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think RFK and Russell Brand, [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11304.619999999999s)]
*  they kind of put stuff on there. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11308.02s)]
*  I've started going. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11309.66s)]
*  Barry Weiss does stuff on there. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11310.38s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11311.619999999999s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11312.119999999999s)]
*  I think Barry does stuff on there. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11313.1s)]
*  She definitely does stuff on Substack. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11314.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love Substack. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11316.1s)]
*  There's a lot of people that do stuff [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11317.46s)]
*  on these alternative networks, which are very important. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11318.96s)]
*  You need other stuff going on. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11321.98s)]
*  It seems like Twitter is going to be a major contender, [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11323.9s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, we put the Elon Musk episode on Twitter, [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11327.26s)]
*  because I asked Elon to do the podcast. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11331.22s)]
*  He said, can we put it on Twitter as well? [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11333.02s)]
*  I was like, yeah, fuck yeah. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11334.779999999999s)]
*  Figure that out. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11336.26s)]
*  Tucker's show on there is giant. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11337.14s)]

*  Giant. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11339.859999999999s)]
*  Well, the video that we have of Elon, [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11340.619999999999s)]
*  I think you got 33 million views. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11342.14s)]

*  That's just there. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11350.66s)]
*  Nothing compared to what it's on Spotify. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11352.22s)]
*  Does it get annoying in all the presidential debates [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11355.66s)]
*  that people keep asking you to host them? [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11357.66s)]

*  The problem with, like, political debates [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11395.18s)]

*  There's a whole team of people that's [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11408.74s)]
*  trying to concoct the right things to say. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11410.42s)]

*  You know, I don't want to do that. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11414.62s)]
*  You have no agenda. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11416.66s)]
*  That's not my thing. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11417.74s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11418.82s)]

*  I certainly want a better option than what we've got right now. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11422.18s)]
*  But that's not my thing. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11425.14s)]
*  And they can't talk you into doing that just [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11427.460000000001s)]
*  because you're popular. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11429.3s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11430.02s)]
*  It's funny. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11430.74s)]
*  They just call you out for it. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11431.22s)]
*  I think it's for fake. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11432.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not even what I'm interested in. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11434.18s)]
*  I'm interested in just having conversations with people [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11437.26s)]
*  that I'm interested in talking to. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11440.02s)]
*  I wouldn't mind seeing the candidates physically fight [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11441.5s)]
*  each other. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11445.58s)]
*  And you call that. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11446.02s)]
*  There should be a fitness component to this. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11448.060000000001s)]
*  RFK Junior would fuck everybody up. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11451.26s)]

*  That's an animal. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11454.94s)]
*  You would fuck them all up. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11456.380000000001s)]
*  He would fuck everybody up. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11458.300000000001s)]
*  You'd just post videos of him doing pull-ups down [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11459.58s)]
*  at the Venice Boardwalk. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11461.9s)]

*  Super healthy. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11464.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11465.42s)]
*  It's, you know, look, no one wants that job. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11466.220000000001s)]
*  And I think what it's really going to boil down to [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11469.54s)]
*  is AI as president. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11471.54s)]
*  That's what it's going to boil down to. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11472.78s)]
*  There's going to be some hive intelligence. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11474.42s)]
*  And we're all going to relinquish our control [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11477.1s)]
*  to this thing because it's far superior to what we have. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11479.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11483.380000000001s)]
*  Lex is running this? [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11484.300000000001s)]
*  How is this? [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11485.380000000001s)]
*  No, Lex is. [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11486.140000000001s)]
*  But who programs the AI? [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11487.300000000001s)]
*  That's the real problem. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11488.740000000002s)]
*  That's the problem. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11489.86s)]
*  Well, the real way to handle it would be, [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11490.740000000002s)]
*  you let the AI program itself once it becomes sentient. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11493.42s)]
*  And then it's going to realize that you're a problem. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11496.42s)]
*  And that's what Elon said. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11498.58s)]
*  Like, it's going to realize that if overpopulation [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11499.86s)]
*  is the problem, then people are the problem. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11502.1s)]
*  It's going to make these logical conclusions. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11503.34s)]
*  You've got to give it to some people. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11505.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11506.7s)]
*  And I remember watching this thing about when there was [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11507.82s)]
*  this robot that they programmed to, [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11511.78s)]
*  because I guess they work on, for lack of a better word, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11513.1s)]
*  a point system of how economical that they can be, [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11515.02s)]
*  of what's the shortest way, the most efficient way [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11517.539999999999s)]
*  to get something done. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11519.66s)]
*  And there was a table like this, and they told the robot, [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11520.9s)]
*  get on top of the table. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11523.18s)]
*  So it was like, the program, what you program with [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11525.26s)]
*  is very important, the way you say, get on top of the table. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11527.38s)]
*  So the robot thought for a second, [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11529.74s)]
*  pushed the table to the ground, breaking the legs, [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11531.58s)]
*  and then stepped on top of the table. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11534.58s)]
*  Because that was the most efficient way to do it. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11536.3s)]
*  Instead of, we would go, oh, you would jump on top. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11538.22s)]
*  But that was our idea of what a robot would do. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11540.38s)]
*  The robot's not worried about destroying a table. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11542.38s)]
*  Didn't give a shit. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11543.779999999999s)]
*  It was like, oh, I'm getting on top of that. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11545.099999999999s)]
*  Boom. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11547.38s)]
*  And it was like, oh, shit. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11548.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all someone would have to do [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11549.66s)]
*  is tell it that you can't listen to people, [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11551.3s)]
*  because people are stupid. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11554.14s)]
*  And then it would just make decisions based on logic. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11555.78s)]
*  And what's better for the Earth? [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11558.1s)]
*  You might make an overall choice that for biodiversity on Earth, [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11560.18s)]
*  it would be better if humans didn't exist. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11564.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's logical to just put a bullet [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11566.74s)]
*  in the head of the girl throwing soup at the Monet. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11568.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11570.820000000002s)]
*  Like, this is costing a lot of money. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11571.300000000001s)]
*  Well, that's how they do it in Russia. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11572.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11574.220000000001s)]
*  It's so true. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11575.380000000001s)]
*  That's why they don't do that shit over there. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11576.140000000001s)]
*  I got to say, I had these Russian hair extensions for a while, [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11578.02s)]
*  and they were very healthy. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11580.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, the people over there. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11582.58s)]
*  Best hair. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11585.14s)]
*  They're feeding. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11585.859999999999s)]
*  They're eating well over there. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11586.58s)]
*  Well, GMO foods, it's illegal to grow GMO crops over there. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11587.779999999999s)]
*  I mean, I feel like we're the only idiots. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11591.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11593.619999999999s)]
*  That's how it should be. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11594.14s)]
*  That's how it should be. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11595.26s)]
*  I mean, Italy is banning the lab-grown meat [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11595.9s)]
*  and a lot of that stuff, too, in Europe. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11598.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, what we're doing is not good. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11601.38s)]
*  But also, we have extraordinary population problems, [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11603.539999999999s)]
*  like in major areas where they're not growing food. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11606.46s)]
*  That's a big problem. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11608.98s)]
*  Right, right. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11609.9s)]
*  You got to get them food somehow or another. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11610.5s)]
*  How are you going to get them food? [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11612.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's so true. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11612.9s)]
*  What are you going to do about all those areas that [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11613.619999999999s)]
*  have monocrop agriculture? [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11615.339999999998s)]
*  Do you know how long it takes to take an industrialized farm [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11616.619999999999s)]
*  and convert it to a regenerative farm? [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11619.779999999999s)]
*  When I had Will Harris from White Oaks Pastures on, [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11622.779999999999s)]
*  he said it took almost 20 years for them [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11624.98s)]
*  to convert their family farm to a regenerative farm. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11628.22s)]
*  I mean, now it's awesome. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11631.58s)]
*  It's just the soil is so depleted. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11632.5s)]
*  Everything. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11634.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've got to plant it out, [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11635.099999999999s)]
*  and it takes extraordinary amounts of money. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11636.66s)]
*  You're not going to make as much money. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11638.46s)]
*  You're not going to get as much yield off the land. [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11639.98s)]
*  There's a lot involved. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11643.06s)]
*  And you're trying to develop. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11644.019999999999s)]
*  What you're trying to do is mimic nature [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11645.9s)]
*  in a controlled environment. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11647.539999999999s)]
*  It's a lot to it. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11650.18s)]
*  You have to have grazing land. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11651.42s)]
*  You have to take the manure. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11652.779999999999s)]
*  You have to have chickens roaming around and pigs. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11653.939999999999s)]
*  You have to move them. [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11656.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many different things that have to happen. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11657.98s)]
*  But the end result is natural and balanced. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11661.1s)]
*  And it's actually carbon neutral. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11664.38s)]
*  So that's what everybody wants. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11666.939999999999s)]
*  But most industrialized farms are horrible. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11668.74s)]
*  Have you ever seen those pig farms where they fly over [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11672.900000000001s)]
*  and with drones, and you see these lakes of shit and piss [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11674.5s)]
*  that they have where they just drain out [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11677.94s)]
*  from the bottom of the cage and see these fucking [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11679.7s)]
*  insane lakes of piss and shit? [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11682.7s)]
*  And this is something I dealt with when my dad was sick [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11685.900000000001s)]
*  because he was in a bed for a long time [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11688.02s)]
*  and kept having to be on antibiotics [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11689.66s)]
*  and developed antibiotic resistance. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11691.140000000001s)]
*  And they say that when meat has all that antibiotics in it, [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11692.66s)]
*  because they're waiting in their own shit [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11695.94s)]
*  and have to be on them, that we're consuming antibiotics. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11698.02s)]
*  So by the time you actually need them, they may not work. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11701.3s)]
*  Crazy. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11703.66s)]
*  I gotta wrap this up, Whitney. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11706.5s)]
*  We've already been doing like three and a half hours. [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11707.82s)]
*  Like that. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11710.3s)]
*  How long was that? [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11711.98s)]
*  I miss you. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11712.82s)]
*  I miss you too. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11713.66s)]
*  Yeah, three and a half hours. [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11715.859999999999s)]
*  Move here. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11718.66s)]
*  Oh dude, I'm trying. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11719.5s)]
*  Come on, man, it's fun. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11721.42s)]
*  I'm trying. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11722.26s)]
*  The last place. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11723.58s)]
*  I told you, all the ways they're trying to keep us now, [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11724.42s)]
*  you gotta pay 5% of what you make [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11728.5s)]
*  if you sell your house in LA, [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11730.54s)]
*  you gotta pay it to the city of LA. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11731.7s)]
*  They're not letting us leave. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11733.900000000001s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11734.980000000001s)]
*  It's so crazy, but it might be overturned. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11735.980000000001s)]
*  They just steal money. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11737.78s)]
*  They just steal it. It's criminal, dude. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11738.78s)]
*  But I would honestly pay it at this point [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11740.5s)]
*  just to maybe get out. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11741.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11744.140000000001s)]
*  Once the kid's born, you're gonna wanna get out. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11745.1s)]
*  I think so too. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11746.7s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna wanna, I gotta get the fuck out of here [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11747.54s)]
*  and you come here and it's nice and peaceful. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11749.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11751.18s)]
*  All right. I'm on it. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11752.02s)]
*  I love you, my friend. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11753.34s)]

*  Thanks for having me. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11755.34s)]
*  Tell everybody about your special. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11756.380000000001s)]
*  O-F dot TV slash Whitney. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11758.34s)]
*  It's free. It's on OnlyFansTV. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11760.3s)]
*  It's called Mouthy. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11761.699999999999s)]
*  There it is. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11762.98s)]

*  Let's go. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11766.14s)]
*  I really look like I'm... [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11767.099999999999s)]
*  How pregnant were you here? [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11768.3s)]
*  This was, I was seven months pregnant. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11769.3s)]
*  So it's a month ago. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11771.06s)]
*  It's all the fad. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11772.859999999999s)]
*  There it is. Yep. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11774.099999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11774.939999999999s)]
*  At the store. Nice. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11775.779999999999s)]
*  I did it, yeah, I did it in the main room. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11777.019999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11778.539999999999s)]
*  I hear Fitzsimmons is shooting his special [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11779.38s)]
*  at the mothership. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11780.9s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11781.74s)]
*  Yeah, we're excited. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11782.58s)]
*  Yeah, Brian Simpson shot is here. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11783.58s)]
*  Duncan shot one here. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11785.859999999999s)]
*  Stan Hope shot one here. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11786.939999999999s)]
*  It makes no sense that we do like an away game [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11788.98s)]
*  every time we shoot a special. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11789.98s)]
*  We shoot at some theater we've never been in before. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11791.06s)]
*  It's fun. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11792.9s)]
*  And also I just think comedy at a club is the greatest. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11793.74s)]
*  It's about Fahim Anwar. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11796.939999999999s)]
*  Fahim kills me. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11798.18s)]
*  He did a special at the store [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11800.42s)]
*  and I was watching it with somebody [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11802.14s)]
*  who's not in the business in any capacity [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11803.74s)]
*  and he just went, why aren't all specials like this? [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11805.34s)]
*  I feel like I'm in the crowd. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11807.619999999999s)]
*  And I was like... [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11808.46s)]
*  Exactly, you feel like you're in the crowd. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11809.3s)]
*  Everybody wants to show everybody [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11810.46s)]
*  they can sell out a giant arena. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11811.82s)]
*  We do it for other comics. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11813.3s)]
*  Why am I looking at architecture? [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11814.619999999999s)]
*  Well, the industry wants you to do that too. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11815.82s)]
*  They want you to be at a giant place that looks beautiful. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11817.740000000002s)]
*  No one needs to see a crane shot in Goldleaf Architectural. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11820.060000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWs-_ql-tc&t=11822.54s)]
