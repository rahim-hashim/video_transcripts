*  The unreliable twin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=33.0s)]
*  Danny's the arrogant twin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=34.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=35.0s)]

*  Michael's like, we're going to be at the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=56.0s)]
*  And all of your guests are really smart. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=58.0s)]
*  I feel like people will be dumb about listening to us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=61.0s)]
*  There's a lot of dumb ones too. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=62.0s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=63.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=64.0s)]
*  That'll be the playlist we're in. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=65.0s)]
*  So tell me about you guys, the background. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=67.0s)]
*  First of all, how did it come that you made that movie? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, we've always wanted to make films ever since we were like little kids. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=73.0s)]
*  Is that your first, like, real film? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=77.0s)]
*  That was our first proper production. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=79.0s)]
*  That fucking movie was awesome. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=80.0s)]
*  It was so weird that you posted about it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=82.0s)]
*  How did you hear about it? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=83.0s)]
*  I was just flipping through, I think I was just flipping through, like, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=84.0s)]
*  the current movies on Apple, on Apple TV. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=93.0s)]
*  My daughter loves horror movies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=94.0s)]
*  And so we like to watch horror movies together. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=95.0s)]
*  And I was like, let's try this one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=98.0s)]
*  And we watched a preview and she was like, oh, it's good. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=100.0s)]
*  And then I watched it, like, that is a really good original movie. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=102.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=106.0s)]
*  It's fucking scary as shit. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=107.0s)]
*  Oh, man, it's crazy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=108.0s)]
*  And it wasn't like any other movie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=109.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, oh, this is like 28 days later or this is like The Exorcist. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=111.0s)]
*  No, it's like very original. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=118.0s)]
*  It's something we've been like building towards making a movie for forever. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=119.0s)]
*  Like, and we've been writing scripts forever as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=123.0s)]
*  We had a YouTube channel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=126.0s)]
*  So we started off like making stuff as little kids. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=127.0s)]
*  We've been obsessed since we were seven years old with like making stuff. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=130.0s)]
*  Even before filming, we just draw movie covers and shit like that and pretend [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=134.0s)]
*  we're we like play act through a movie and look at the time and like act for 90 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=138.0s)]
*  minutes and then draw the cover for that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=144.0s)]
*  Like we were loser kids. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was creative. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=149.0s)]
*  I remember even in primary school, they had to bring my mom in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=150.0s)]
*  They're like, we're really concerned about Danny because I would draw the most [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=153.0s)]
*  violent fucked up movie covers or just just like some of them split in half, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=155.0s)]
*  trying to figure out different ways that I could kill these stick figures or, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=159.0s)]
*  you know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=163.0s)]
*  Like it was like and then like we had a group of friends around the same age, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=164.0s)]
*  like 12, 15 kids at same age in the neighborhood. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=170.0s)]
*  And we do two things together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=171.0s)]
*  We beat the shit out of each other, like backyard wrestling. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=172.0s)]
*  And then we do make movies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=174.0s)]
*  And that's like if our friends want to hang out with us, they had to do it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=176.0s)]
*  Like I feel bad for them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=179.0s)]
*  And then like they come together and we just fuck each other up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=180.0s)]
*  And then we'd like film movies and stuff. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=183.0s)]
*  So you've always been interested in some kind of filming and something. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=185.0s)]
*  And so you started off with a YouTube channel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=192.0s)]
*  Well, initially we were just making stuff with friends. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=193.0s)]
*  And then a TV show was called To Muffy, 96 episodes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=196.0s)]
*  And where was that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=200.0s)]
*  That was just. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=201.0s)]
*  It always says it's a TV show. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=202.0s)]
*  It was never on TV. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=204.0s)]
*  It was on our TV. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=205.0s)]
*  It was on our TV. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=206.0s)]
*  We would play it for our friend's older sister, Nellie. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=207.0s)]
*  And we would just premiere it for her. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=210.0s)]
*  And as we got older, all of our friends were growing out of it and were like, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=212.0s)]
*  why are you still doing this? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=215.0s)]
*  It's really immature. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=216.0s)]
*  Everyone was growing up getting jobs, getting girlfriends. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=217.0s)]
*  And we were still trying to make movies. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=221.0s)]
*  We'd organize like a big weekend with everyone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=222.0s)]
*  But everyone was 18. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=223.0s)]
*  Like in Australia, you can go out when you're 18. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=224.0s)]
*  And we're like, look, guys, we've organized this weekend filming, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=227.0s)]
*  like trying to organize with these people. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=229.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, no, I'm fucking going out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=231.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=232.0s)]
*  Doing this shit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=233.0s)]
*  And then like, yeah, we had to. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=234.0s)]
*  We were doing a media course like after high school. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=237.0s)]
*  Didn't know what like, oh, let's just pursue this thing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=240.0s)]
*  Even though film industry is film isn't a thing in Australia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=243.0s)]
*  So we're just filming stuff. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=246.0s)]
*  It's a thing, but it's not. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=247.0s)]
*  No one looks at it like there's no entertainment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=249.0s)]
*  It's not like LA. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=251.0s)]
*  It's not like LA. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=252.0s)]
*  It's not like LA. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=253.0s)]
*  First time I went to LA and everyone's talking about scripture. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=254.0s)]
*  Like, holy fuck, it's like a real, it feels like a different world almost. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=256.0s)]
*  Or an impossible job. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=261.0s)]
*  Because at school, if you're like, I want to be a filmmaker, teachers are like, what? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=262.0s)]
*  You need to be an electrician. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=265.0s)]
*  I remember that was one of our teachers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=266.0s)]
*  You should be an electrician or you've got to pick a trade. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=267.0s)]
*  Because it just seems, it seems impossible. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=269.0s)]
*  You know, as a kid, it seems impossible to. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=273.0s)]
*  But it was like pre-YouTube sort of stuff. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=274.0s)]
*  And then like we were doing, like I was doing like just like work experience jobs on movies [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=276.0s)]
*  just to get experience. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=281.0s)]
*  Like, cause no one will turn away, no one will ever turn away like a free pair of hands. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=282.0s)]
*  And I'd always be like, oh, come on set for free. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=286.0s)]
*  Just let me, I just want to like, I want to see everything, how things work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=289.0s)]
*  So I worked with all different departments and a lot of people that we worked with, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=292.0s)]
*  we used on our movie because I remember like the ones that were like there for a reason, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=295.0s)]
*  like they're like excited to be there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=300.0s)]
*  Versus the ones that were like, you know, like depressed and like don't really want to be there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=302.0s)]
*  It's just like a paycheck thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=306.0s)]
*  So like I remembered like certain people, caterers, grips, all from different departments. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=308.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to use these people when we do our movies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=312.0s)]
*  Cultivate the good ones. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=317.0s)]
*  Cause like on a film set, like when it's like, like the crew morale is so big. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=318.0s)]
*  Like if you have like everyone clashing and work against each other. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=323.0s)]
*  That being said, I think we did piss off crew a whole bunch of times. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=326.0s)]
*  Maybe because it was supposed to be an eight week shoot. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=329.0s)]
*  It turned to a five. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=331.0s)]
*  But anyway, you're, you're just skipping ahead, man. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=332.0s)]
*  Oi, I'm just saying. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=334.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=335.0s)]
*  So we went to, we had to finish this series that we did and no one wants to do it anymore. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=336.0s)]
*  Everyone had grown out of it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=342.0s)]
*  So we started just finding different ways to express ourselves. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=343.0s)]
*  We could never get a normal job. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=346.0s)]
*  So my only paid job I ever did was medical trials, checking into hospitals and testing out drugs that went on the market yet. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=348.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=354.0s)]
*  You did that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah. I did that for two years. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=356.0s)]
*  What did they test out on you? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=357.0s)]
*  I stopped listening. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=358.0s)]
*  You know, I was like, whatever. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=359.0s)]
*  You just let them try it? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=362.0s)]
*  They told me that like, oh, this could happen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=363.0s)]
*  This could happen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=364.0s)]
*  And I was like, just give me whatever. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=365.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Just give me some money. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=366.0s)]
*  Danny would have crazy like side effects. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=367.0s)]
*  It was like yellow once. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah. So yellow now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=373.0s)]
*  He was like, he was like, once he was like, we have ADHD. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=374.0s)]
*  We have always shaking. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=377.0s)]
*  But Danny was like, once he was like this, I went to visit him. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=378.0s)]
*  He was doing like shaking and I was like, you're right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=381.0s)]
*  I was like, yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=383.0s)]
*  Side effect of the drug. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=384.0s)]
*  Anyway, it was like a muscle tremors all up through my arm. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=385.0s)]
*  So I just couldn't physically. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=389.0s)]
*  What was that drug? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=390.0s)]
*  I literally, dude, I did not listen to that would tell me that would send all these big pamphlets and we have to sign a bunch of shit, but I would never listen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=391.0s)]
*  I would never know what I was there for. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=398.0s)]
*  I would never do this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=399.0s)]
*  Did you have any concern about doing that? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=400.0s)]
*  No, I was more excited to get some cash. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=402.0s)]
*  How old were you at the time? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=403.0s)]
*  18. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=404.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=405.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=406.0s)]
*  You shouldn't let 18 year olds make that decision. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=407.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=408.0s)]
*  18 to 20 is when I did it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=409.0s)]
*  Well, it was a way for you to like, make money and meet like people, because there's a lot of interesting people that would go through there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=411.0s)]
*  But I just hate injections. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=417.0s)]
*  I also didn't try and get over my fear for injection because once they take like administer the drug, they have to like get your blood every 15 minutes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=418.0s)]
*  So like they put the cannulas in their arm in your arm and they just keep taking out blood, taking out blood and just testing whether or not things would go wrong. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=425.0s)]
*  What was the worst side effect you got? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=431.0s)]
*  He grew a third eye. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=434.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=435.0s)]
*  I remember it was they were administering it with like a cannula. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=436.0s)]
*  It was it was a drip. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=440.0s)]
*  They were dripping the injection of the drug in and it was really fucking hurting. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=441.0s)]
*  And usually it doesn't hurt. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=445.0s)]
*  Usually I just like take it or they would minister it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=446.0s)]
*  I don't really feel anything, but it was painful. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=449.0s)]
*  It was hurting. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=451.0s)]
*  It was hurting. I was like, oh, God. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=452.0s)]
*  She's like, you're right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=454.0s)]
*  You can keep. Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=455.0s)]
*  That's like, oh, fuck. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=456.0s)]
*  That really drills. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=457.0s)]
*  It was like felt like someone was punching my arm. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=458.0s)]
*  They missed the vein. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=459.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=460.0s)]
*  It was like whatever happened was my whole arm went paralyzed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=461.0s)]
*  And I was like, dude, I'm like, I can't I can't I can't move. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=466.0s)]
*  I can't feel my hand. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=470.0s)]
*  I can't move my hand. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=471.0s)]
*  She's like, all right, well, just squeeze my fingers. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=472.0s)]
*  Put a finger there to try and squeeze it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=473.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I literally can't do it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=474.0s)]
*  So she said that I quickly take the drug out and they took the drug out. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=476.0s)]
*  And I was just sort of sitting over paralyzed arm and probably sat there for like an hour. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=479.0s)]
*  And once the drug had worn off, I got my feeling. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=483.0s)]
*  And you don't remember what that drug was? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=485.0s)]
*  Fuck, I'm so sorry. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=487.0s)]
*  I really I could dig it up. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=488.0s)]
*  My email is probably. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=489.0s)]
*  But yeah, how many different drugs they try in you? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=490.0s)]
*  I did have a two, two, three years. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=493.0s)]
*  So over 10 drugs, I'd say different things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=495.0s)]
*  I tried. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=497.0s)]
*  It was like you go on there for like like some like four. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=498.0s)]
*  See, I was doing the work experience and said, but I was going to buy it was free. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=501.0s)]
*  So Danny would do the stuff that got the money. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=505.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that was the longest time I was in hospital for. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=507.0s)]
*  I could range from three days in hospital to two months. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=510.0s)]
*  So, yeah, one time I was in there for two months for what? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=513.0s)]
*  For the drugs. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=516.0s)]
*  So you just stayed in the hospital for two months while they administered drugs? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=518.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=522.0s)]
*  And then they pretty much just wait to see what the side effects are going to be. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=523.0s)]
*  If they think you have to sleep in the hospital and stay there. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah, you just stay there overnight. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=528.0s)]
*  How much do they pay you for something like that? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=529.0s)]
*  One hundred and fifty bucks a day, one hundred twenty bucks a day. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=531.0s)]
*  Australian. So what is that? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=533.0s)]
*  One hundred US or something like that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=535.0s)]
*  Less than that. Yeah. Ninety dollars USD a day. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=537.0s)]
*  For months. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah. Once, two months. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=540.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=542.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=544.0s)]
*  No, it is crazy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=545.0s)]
*  Like there was that famous case. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=546.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was in where it was, but the the patients, because they do it like, you know, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=547.0s)]
*  where they'll test one person and half an hour later test another than another. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=552.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=555.0s)]
*  And then people started dying off and like, then you was like going down the line because like someone died half an hour later. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=556.0s)]
*  That was like a freak. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=563.0s)]
*  And that was the last guy and they go and they go, look, look. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're about to fucking die. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=566.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, no, there's a side effect. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=568.0s)]
*  You're probably next. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=570.0s)]
*  How many people died? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=571.0s)]
*  What? I don't know what story specifically this guy's talking about, but the trials that I was checking to no one died. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=572.0s)]
*  The worst one I heard of was they tested on mice before they tested on the humans. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=577.0s)]
*  And they had to bring everyone back into the trial and say, hey, guys, and I heard this from a friend that recommended the trials to me. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=581.0s)]
*  He's like, guys, we don't want anyone to worry. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=587.0s)]
*  But some of the mice have gone blind. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=589.0s)]
*  And yeah, so everyone was sort of waiting to see if someone was going to fuck up their site. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=592.0s)]
*  But it was after you'd already gotten the drug. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it was a friend. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=598.0s)]
*  This is a friend's experience. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. They'd had the drug and they brought everyone back in like a week later and they said some of the mice have gone blind. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=600.0s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=604.0s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, what was the best part is when they. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=606.0s)]
*  The best part was when. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=611.0s)]
*  The blindness was the best part. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=612.0s)]
*  The best part is when the drug goes wrong and then you get to leave early because you don't have to stay for the two months. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=614.0s)]
*  Like, this drug is too dangerous. We're not going to test it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=620.0s)]
*  And then you get paid for the full amount. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=622.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. That makes no sense. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=624.0s)]
*  The drug goes wrong. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=626.0s)]
*  Yeah. So like that one, when they administered it and my whole arm went paralyzed, they realized they couldn't administer that drug to everyone else. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=627.0s)]
*  So the trial got called off. But you got paid for the full month. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=633.0s)]
*  No long term side effects? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=636.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=638.0s)]
*  I don't know. I've never really questioned it until you're looking at me like I'm crazy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=639.0s)]
*  Come on, man. What's what's it's just the drug. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=644.0s)]
*  If you pay attention to drug trials and how many drugs get approved and then pulled because they find justice after approval. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=646.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're way before approval. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=653.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Your guinea pig. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=655.0s)]
*  I was. Yeah, I was guinea pig. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=656.0s)]
*  He was a guinea pig after the guinea pigs. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=657.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It was. It was. Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=659.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of a safety net to be like, oh, it's tried on hamsters before. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=661.0s)]
*  Yeah. But yeah, it was it was pretty dodgy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=667.0s)]
*  But it was the only way that I could make money. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=670.0s)]
*  No, you could get a normal job. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=672.0s)]
*  No, I'm telling you, Joe. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=674.0s)]
*  I cannot get a normal job. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=676.0s)]
*  Our minds would never let us do that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=678.0s)]
*  Like I could never. I don't know. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=679.0s)]
*  Like focus. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Focus. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=684.0s)]
*  Like you always just seeing life through like as a movie scene or something like that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=685.0s)]
*  The one job I had, I had two jobs. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=688.0s)]
*  One was recycling like bottles. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=691.0s)]
*  And then the other one was I was it was in between the years, the media course. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=694.0s)]
*  And I was like, I got like a job illegally, like rolling dirt. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=698.0s)]
*  You know, like before they built a house, they like rolled dirt with like, yeah, like flatten earth. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=703.0s)]
*  And I was in that machine on this hill, flattening earth. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=708.0s)]
*  And then I was like, in my I was like to make time go by, I was like in my own imagination world, like in a movie scene, like, you know, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=711.0s)]
*  and I was just like playing a movie in my head and I was going closer and closer to the edge. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=719.0s)]
*  And they started ringing like they'll talk to me on the radio, dude, stop. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=722.0s)]
*  You're going too far past the you know, you're going to go off the edge. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=726.0s)]
*  And I rolled the fucking machine. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=729.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=731.0s)]
*  And then I felt like it was like exciting as I got something happen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=733.0s)]
*  I feel like that's more dangerous than my drug trials. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=736.0s)]
*  No, because if you if you pay attention, like if you pay attention to your drug trial, you still got to go blind. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=738.0s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=745.0s)]
*  I'm wondering. It was you know, it was like an attention. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=746.0s)]
*  It's like that's where you say for. Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=750.0s)]
*  But I actually want to check back into a trial now and just to try and get some writing done because you can't. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=752.0s)]
*  You want to do it again. I do want to do it again. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=758.0s)]
*  Yeah. You just meet interesting people in there. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=760.0s)]
*  Like who are these people that are in there? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=762.0s)]
*  They're dumb people that are getting injected with experimental drugs. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=764.0s)]
*  Don't do that. Don't do that again. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=767.0s)]
*  I think it's like you can't go anywhere. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=769.0s)]
*  There's no distractions. You're just in a hospital bed with your laptop. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=771.0s)]
*  You have to get some writing done. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=774.0s)]
*  Can't you just check yourself into a hotel? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=775.0s)]
*  It doesn't work because you could just walk out. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=777.0s)]
*  You can't leave this trial. You'll get fucking shot. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=779.0s)]
*  No, you won't really. But yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=782.0s)]
*  Look man, if Joe Rogan tells you not to do it, don't do it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=784.0s)]
*  Write it down. Don't do it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=786.0s)]
*  Don't do it. It's advice. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=788.0s)]
*  Are you guys both left handed? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=790.0s)]
*  No, I'm right handed. We're mirror image. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=791.0s)]
*  We're mirror image. Yeah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=793.0s)]
*  No wait, I'm left handed. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm right handed. Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=796.0s)]
*  But yeah, the left handed is your. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=798.0s)]
*  We're split like a because we're mirror image. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=800.0s)]
*  I guess I'm more physical and. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like the nerd twin. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=806.0s)]
*  Danny's more like the brains. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=807.0s)]
*  Like I'll get hit by cars for videos and Danny will record it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=809.0s)]
*  And tell him to go faster. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=812.0s)]
*  And every time we did a car hit, we'd have to like we step it up a little bit. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=814.0s)]
*  There was one nasty one we did and I was like, because I was like, oh, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=818.0s)]
*  I know that if it does like half-arsed, then you go do it again. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=822.0s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, let's just do it like a good. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=826.0s)]
*  Usually I have some performers for car hits because you usually you you are [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=828.0s)]
*  before you hit someone in a car, you like break a little bit to like dip the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=831.0s)]
*  bonnet down. And this guy wasn't a stunt driver. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=835.0s)]
*  And I was like, I just do it. And then and then he hit me and I was like, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=838.0s)]
*  well, it's an interesting thing for car hits where it's like because you lose [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=842.0s)]
*  where you are for like a flash second, you know, getting a concussion. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=845.0s)]
*  Yeah. I got to say, wait, do you have the video of it? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was extreme. He's a pretty brutal car hit. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=852.0s)]
*  It was like a brutal one. How many times have you been hit by cars? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=854.0s)]
*  Oh, well, two dozens, something like that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=857.0s)]
*  What the fuck, dude? But it's like a stunt man. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=860.0s)]
*  Michael's a certified in Australia. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=862.0s)]
*  You have to get certification to get stunt like a stunt license in America. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=865.0s)]
*  You can just say I'm a stunt guy and then I guess if you're bad, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=869.0s)]
*  they just won't call you back or something. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=872.0s)]
*  So was getting hit 24 times a part of that. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=874.0s)]
*  Also, some of the stuff was like martial arts for six months, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=878.0s)]
*  body control stunt reel being on set for 10 days, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=884.0s)]
*  a letter of recommendation from an assistant stunt coordinator and a stunt coordinator. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=888.0s)]
*  You have to get set on fire. You have to do high falls. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=893.0s)]
*  You have to get your bronze medallion swimming. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=896.0s)]
*  So it's like a big every there's like five categories you have to do. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=899.0s)]
*  Maybe it takes a few years, but I was driving like I was production running for a TV show [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=902.0s)]
*  and I met a stunt guy, Judd Wilde, and we just got along. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=907.0s)]
*  I was interested in stunts. We've been doing stunts since we were little kids. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=912.0s)]
*  I showed him some of our old videos like pre YouTube. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=916.0s)]
*  And then he's like, dude, you should get accredited. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=919.0s)]
*  And then he helped me get my accreditation. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=922.0s)]
*  I was doing some editing for him, some stuff. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=925.0s)]
*  And then for our videos, we would get him and we'd create. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=927.0s)]
*  We were introduced to the stunt world through Judd. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=931.0s)]
*  We've worked with over 100 performers now and special effects guys. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=934.0s)]
*  And we would create different like our videos on YouTube. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=939.0s)]
*  We'd always go like with a new like, oh, how do we do like a sinking set [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=942.0s)]
*  where we can fire in the set sinking and filling with water? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=947.0s)]
*  Or how do we do this? This rig, this stunt rig? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=950.0s)]
*  And we'd like innovate and like create different things. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=953.0s)]
*  So we're looking forward to doing an action movie because we have a cool team. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=956.0s)]
*  We're attached right now to the Street Fighter movie. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=959.0s)]
*  Yeah, for the Capcom video game. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=962.0s)]
*  Hold on. Do you have video? You getting hit by a car? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=964.0s)]
*  Yeah. Let me see this. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=966.0s)]
*  Wait, cause the thing that the. It's cool. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=968.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. This is a bad one. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=970.0s)]
*  Wait, no, no, no. Let me see this one. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=972.0s)]
*  Fine. I mean, you can tell me a better one after this, but it's fine. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=974.0s)]
*  Let's see this one. This is not him. The next one will be him. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=976.0s)]
*  Yeah. So this is a stunt performance thing. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=980.0s)]
*  You could get hit faster. It's not faster. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=982.0s)]
*  This whole window is fucking coming through. Oh, Jesus. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=990.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're done. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=993.0s)]

*  It goes flying. If you like car hits, man. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1015.0s)]
*  But there's a. The way that I do car hits is different to stunt guys, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1017.0s)]
*  because stunt guys, like you kind of. Get the damn link. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1020.0s)]
*  You lean back and you kind of let them. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1024.0s)]
*  I should be able to airdrop it to my computer. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1028.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and get the link. Get the fucking link, man. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1030.0s)]
*  All right. I'm going to get the link. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1032.0s)]
*  I don't know what's dumber, the car accidents or the injections. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1035.0s)]
*  OK, but stunt performers, you know, in films. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1038.0s)]
*  You guys are fucking out of control. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1045.0s)]
*  But you know, stunt performers in films, you know, get run over by cars all the time. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1047.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good either. Yeah, no. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1051.0s)]
*  You know, like the practical elements of filmmaking, the practical elements. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1053.0s)]
*  Is that what you're going to call it? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1057.0s)]
*  You know, there's a CG fight scene or like a practical fight scene [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1059.0s)]
*  where they actually, you know, go on hard. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1062.0s)]
*  That's a that's a profession. Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1064.0s)]
*  You don't want it to be. You can always tell. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1066.0s)]
*  OK, I've got a link. What do I do? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1068.0s)]
*  You can airdrop it to my MacBook Pro, I think. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1070.0s)]
*  If possibly get it up, I copy the link. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1073.0s)]
*  And then I and then when you go to share, you should be able to airdrop. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1076.0s)]
*  OK, gotcha. Share. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1079.0s)]
*  I keep talking about how dumb we are. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1081.0s)]
*  No, well, I just think that we always respect when you see things done [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1083.0s)]
*  practically in terms of stunts, whenever it turns to CG, there's a disconnect. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1086.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And so some performers that really, really innovate their craft [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1091.0s)]
*  or really put their bodies on the line or build up to a really big stunt artists [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1095.0s)]
*  for our film for stunt for Street Fighter. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1099.0s)]
*  We know we want to do a whole bunch of practical stunts. Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1102.0s)]
*  And we've started designing the fight scenes already and figuring them out in our head. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1105.0s)]
*  So we're so excited to do what we do in the backyard, but with a proper budget [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1108.0s)]
*  and a proper team. So you guys are doing all this fucking around [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1112.0s)]
*  and having a good time and creating all these things. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1116.0s)]
*  How does it get to talk to me? So we always wanted to. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1118.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. We always wanted to get into filmmaking and make films. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1122.0s)]
*  The YouTube stuff was a really good way for us to just build up as filmmakers. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1126.0s)]
*  It was an accident, though, as well. Like YouTube, we just posted [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1131.0s)]
*  because we were doing fake fail videos, like pretending things went wrong when they didn't, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1134.0s)]
*  like sticking a knife into a toaster, things like that, and just putting them on Facebook. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1139.0s)]
*  And they were going really viral. But no one knew where they were coming from. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1142.0s)]
*  So we create our friends said, you should do a YouTube channel just to show where like who's making the stuff. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1147.0s)]
*  And we didn't expect anything from it. Like we were working on short films and things like that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1153.0s)]
*  And then one that in the inside a year, the like the channel got how many million subscribers? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1156.0s)]
*  A million subscribers. And then we're like we're not even putting that much effort into these videos. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1163.0s)]
*  What if we actually focus on it? And we went down the rabbit hole of YouTube forever. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1167.0s)]
*  But the end goal was always film and television. We never set out to be YouTubers. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1171.0s)]
*  But the world's so fun, you know, and it's instant gratification. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1176.0s)]
*  You see growth, comments, likes, you know, and, you know, and cool opportunities to like go to cool countries and do like awesome things. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1179.0s)]
*  You end up just like you're chasing trends and you're just following the algorithm and you're not really expressing yourself towards the end. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1188.0s)]
*  So that's what I was like. I don't know if we were doing that. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1195.0s)]
*  Oh, we were towards the end. Don't even lie. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1197.0s)]
*  It was more like you could. Yeah, like it was like our videos are like crazy like action comedy, but stunts, stunt stuff that we don't like the movies. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1199.0s)]
*  We start like watching is very different to the stuff we were making. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1208.0s)]
*  So if we couldn't, you couldn't do like a deep serious thing on our channel like because people just click off straight away, you know, you have to be like, you have someone to jump through a window like within three seconds. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1211.0s)]
*  Could never express myself personally. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1221.0s)]
*  Like I wanted to have scenes where two characters can sit down and have a conversation. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1223.0s)]
*  But with our YouTube channel, we weren't able to do that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1226.0s)]
*  But hold on as you say, weren't able to. You just didn't want to because you didn't think you'd get as much engagement. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1228.0s)]
*  Well, I think that the audience that we built would be like, what the fuck is this? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1233.0s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1236.0s)]
*  We posted some like longer stuff. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1238.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1240.0s)]
*  But you know what? It's actually true. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1241.0s)]
*  We never did like we never went for it in that way and tried to do it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1243.0s)]
*  But we just saw once we had like a minute intro, like a slow intro, and then you see the attention rate and it's just people that stay past the first minute. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1246.0s)]
*  Watch the whole thing. But you were captured by that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1256.0s)]
*  Like so that the attention span was what motivated you to either do or not do something. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1258.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it affects your reach. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1264.0s)]
*  And you're chasing the algorithm. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1267.0s)]
*  But we would never like YouTube would always tell us things that we'd never listen to them. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1269.0s)]
*  Like if you do this, you'll get more. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1272.0s)]
*  You mean me, you do like someone contacted you and tried to coach you on how to do it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1275.0s)]
*  Well, the first we didn't put ads on our videos at first. YouTube was like at first like, dude, put ads on your stuff. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1279.0s)]
*  We're like, no, we're not doing this for money. We want to just do like we're artists. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1285.0s)]
*  We're just artists. We're artists. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1289.0s)]
*  We're artists. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1291.0s)]
*  As soon as we turn on monetization. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1292.0s)]
*  We're artists who get hit by cars and we practice medicine. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1293.0s)]
*  Can I see? Can I see you get hit by a car? The good one? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1296.0s)]
*  I don't. I didn't see it in here unless I missed it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1299.0s)]
*  It's the very beginning of it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1302.0s)]
*  What link did you send Michael? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1304.0s)]
*  I sent the wrong one. I sent that scene. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1306.0s)]
*  He's the unreliable 20. So stupid. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1308.0s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1310.0s)]
*  What kind of ADD drugs do they give you over in Australia? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1311.0s)]
*  Because you guys are on some shit. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1314.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we haven't on any medication. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1315.0s)]
*  We're not on anything. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1317.0s)]
*  We need to be, you know, very smart. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1318.0s)]
*  No, I don't think you need to be. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1319.0s)]
*  No, no, no, you don't. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1320.0s)]
*  No, what do you have as a superpower? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1322.0s)]
*  But it's it's too sporadic. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1324.0s)]
*  Everything goes. That's OK. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1325.0s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1327.0s)]
*  Because that that creates creativity. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1328.0s)]
*  Right. And also does this on podcasts. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1331.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's OK. That's all right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1333.0s)]
*  When was the last fistfight you were in, Joe? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1335.0s)]
*  Fistfight? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yeah. When was the last brawl you were in? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1338.0s)]
*  I'm not really a brawl person. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1339.0s)]
*  But you have to go to the bar. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1341.0s)]
*  I want to hear about his last fight. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1343.0s)]
*  I have void fights. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1345.0s)]
*  I haven't been in a fight fight since I was in high school [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1346.0s)]
*  other than like an organized fight. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1348.0s)]
*  Oh, right. So in high school was your last fistfight? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1350.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like a fistfight with another kid. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1352.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1354.0s)]
*  What happened? Why did you do it? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1355.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't remember. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1356.0s)]
*  Just some bullshit. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1358.0s)]
*  Did you win? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1360.0s)]
*  The last one I did. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1361.0s)]
*  But the one before you got beaten? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1362.0s)]
*  I definitely lost a bunch of them. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1364.0s)]
*  That's how I got into martial arts. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1365.0s)]
*  Get my ass kicked. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1366.0s)]
*  And why would you get your ass kicked? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1368.0s)]
*  What was the cause? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1370.0s)]
*  I always just get bullied. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1371.0s)]
*  You know, some kids would find you and beat you up [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1372.0s)]
*  or try to beat you up or things along those lines. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1374.0s)]
*  Nothing serious. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1377.0s)]
*  It's like a thing in high school. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1378.0s)]
*  Hey, like you're automatically tested in high school to see. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1380.0s)]
*  This is you right here. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yeah. This is supposed to be like, yeah, OK. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1385.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and play it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1388.0s)]
*  I'd day to jump in front of that car. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1392.0s)]
*  Bro, do it. It's a dead. It's a dead. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1394.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1397.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1400.0s)]
*  No helmet, no padding. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1402.0s)]
*  That. So. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1405.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jackson. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1407.0s)]
*  Yo, I did a kidnap that kid there. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1408.0s)]
*  This is like a parody. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1410.0s)]
*  It's a parody of like. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1412.0s)]
*  Kids at home don't try this. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1415.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was parodying that stuff. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1417.0s)]
*  People get mad at you because people are trying to imitate what you guys are doing, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1418.0s)]
*  getting hit by cars and saying that it's irresponsible. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1421.0s)]
*  No, because our stuff was always like that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1425.0s)]
*  That one was paying out YouTube trends like that, like the Tire Pod Challenge [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1428.0s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1431.0s)]
*  That was like paying that out. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1432.0s)]
*  Our stuff was always like a filmmaker. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1434.0s)]
*  Like it was like it was like it was like stunts and things, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1436.0s)]
*  but it was done through like like a scene, like a movie scene and stuff. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1439.0s)]
*  It wasn't like got it. Jackass. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1441.0s)]
*  Whereas I just go jump in front of it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1443.0s)]
*  You've said like sixty four times. That's OK. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1445.0s)]
*  Oh, like what's your problem? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1447.0s)]
*  Do I have to like lay you out in front of Joe right now? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1449.0s)]
*  Like you can give it a shot. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1451.0s)]
*  Would you start commentating if me and Michael started brawling right now? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1453.0s)]
*  No, I'd probably separate you. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1455.0s)]
*  Oh, that's very nice. It's responsible of you. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1457.0s)]
*  He'd probably jump in. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1458.0s)]
*  I don't want you to break any wires. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1459.0s)]
*  Would you? Would you? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1461.0s)]
*  You know how does the influencer boxing scene? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1462.0s)]
*  You know, should they do something like that in UFC [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1464.0s)]
*  where different people that are more behind the scenes fight each other? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1467.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1470.0s)]
*  You versus Bruce Buffer? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1471.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1472.0s)]
*  Would you watch that? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1473.0s)]
*  No, you want to watch people fight that are actual fighters. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1474.0s)]
*  You don't want to watch people fight. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1476.0s)]
*  Dude, I feel like if you were going to fight Bruce Buffer, that would sell really well. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1478.0s)]
*  Bruce Buffer is my friend. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1480.0s)]
*  I know, but. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1482.0s)]
*  I wouldn't hurt Bruce Buffer. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1483.0s)]
*  That's an example. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1484.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean? People would want to watch that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1485.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's that's like that's like a thing where it's like the YouTube stuff is [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1487.0s)]
*  Yeah, you guys are thinking too much about likes and engagement. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1491.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1494.0s)]
*  No, let's get back to talk to me. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1495.0s)]
*  So we're friends with Israel Adesanya. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1497.0s)]
*  You're friends with him? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1499.0s)]
*  Yeah. I love that dude. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1500.0s)]
*  He's the fucking coolest motherfucker in the world. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1501.0s)]
*  Him and his brother. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1504.0s)]
*  Have you met David, his brother? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1505.0s)]
*  I've met him when he was with Israel, but not like. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1506.0s)]
*  He is the funniest guy ever. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1509.0s)]
*  They're whole families. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1511.0s)]
*  Oh, they're so cool, man. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1512.0s)]
*  Like Izzy saw like we met him through talk to me. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1513.0s)]
*  And then we went to his premiere for his documentary and stuff. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1517.0s)]
*  And then like I used to watch him fight Needs of Fury in Adelaide in South Australia. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1520.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. So I was a fan of him way back when I remember him. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1525.0s)]
*  Like just the first time I saw him fight, he was main event. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1528.0s)]
*  And he was fighting the champ. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1531.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, man, this guy's going to get killed. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1533.0s)]
*  Because to Izzy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1536.0s)]
*  But then Izzy just flying need the dude in the face like first round. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1537.0s)]
*  And the guy didn't get up half an hour. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1540.0s)]
*  Everyone started leaving. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1542.0s)]
*  Fuck, that's crazy. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1543.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was so like savage. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1544.0s)]
*  And the way that he moves is like. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1547.0s)]
*  And there's like a flow and a rhythm like the last fight we went to the last fight. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1549.0s)]
*  It was unfortunate what happened. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1553.0s)]
*  But when he came out like moonwalking, it's like, oh, man, I like he's got such a fucking vibe about it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1556.0s)]
*  He's the best stage presence. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1561.0s)]
*  Coolest guy. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1563.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1564.0s)]
*  So awesome. We want to cast him in something. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1565.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1566.0s)]
*  I feel like he could act. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1568.0s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1569.0s)]
*  Yeah. And do his own stunts. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1570.0s)]
*  So did you guys write? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1572.0s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1573.0s)]
*  Did you have the idea come about? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1574.0s)]
*  There was these neighbors that we watched grow up and one of them was experimenting with drugs for the first time and was having a negative reaction to what he'd taken. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1576.0s)]
*  And he was on the floor convulsing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1584.0s)]
*  And the kids that he was with weren't helping him. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1586.0s)]
*  They were filming him and laughing at him. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1588.0s)]
*  So that was the first like that was the first thing that really stuck into my head that I wanted to put on the page. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1590.0s)]
*  There was a guy named Daley Pearson who produces a show called Bluey in Australia. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1596.0s)]
*  It's like a cartoon kid show. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1601.0s)]
*  He had a short film that was about kids having fun with possession. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1602.0s)]
*  It was a comedy horror short. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1605.0s)]
*  There was no hand or anything. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1608.0s)]
*  There was no hand or anything like that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1610.0s)]
*  It was like that kind of concept of like using it for fun. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1611.0s)]
*  Like possession for fun. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1613.0s)]
*  And everything. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1614.0s)]
*  So I did a rewrite of the short film and then once I did that I just couldn't stop writing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1615.0s)]
*  So within the first 10 days, 12 days I had 80 pages for a script and I've got a co-writer named Bill Hinsman that I send everything through and we just collaborate and bounce drafts back and forth. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1619.0s)]
*  So that happened around 2018, 2019. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1630.0s)]
*  And then we decided that we're going to move out of Australia, move to Hollywood, said goodbye to all our friends and family, did a big dramatic goodbye. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1634.0s)]
*  We're like we're going to go to LA and we're going to sell this fucking script. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1640.0s)]
*  And it's going to take years to sell it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1643.0s)]
*  We went out there and everybody said no. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1645.0s)]
*  Every single every studio said no. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1650.0s)]
*  We couldn't get meetings anywhere. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1652.0s)]
*  There's like a low budget place called Shutter that do low budget horror films. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1654.0s)]
*  We couldn't get a meeting in there. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1659.0s)]
*  So being a YouTuber comes of like a stigma attached to it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1660.0s)]
*  If you want to break outside of it, there's like a stigma for being a YouTuber. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1664.0s)]
*  People knew like we can keep an audience's attention for five minutes but our film is so different. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1668.0s)]
*  Like people will go, yeah, you're a YouTuber not a filmmaker. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1674.0s)]
*  But then like there was one studio that was like eventually. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1678.0s)]
*  But after that we reached out to Causeway Films who Michael did some work experience on this horror film called The Bubble Duke. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1681.0s)]
*  I love that movie. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1686.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1687.0s)]
*  So Michael was. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1688.0s)]
*  I was not. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1689.0s)]
*  You were work experience on The Bubble Duke. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1690.0s)]
*  I was production runner. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1691.0s)]
*  Well Michael was paid to drive around actors. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1692.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1694.0s)]
*  And Danny was. You did lighting. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1695.0s)]
*  I did lighting. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1696.0s)]
*  Do you know work experience was like an intern. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1699.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1700.0s)]
*  So that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1701.0s)]
*  So we reached out to Causeway Films and said we've got this project. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1702.0s)]
*  We sent it through to them. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1704.0s)]
*  They were surprisingly interested and surprisingly took a chance on us. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1705.0s)]
*  They helped us develop the script further. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1709.0s)]
*  So we did another draft. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1711.0s)]
*  And then like probably after three months of them we were ready to go. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1712.0s)]
*  And by then another company in Hollywood reached out and we're going to make it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1715.0s)]
*  But they started giving us creative notes that were pushing it into a bit more of a typical direction. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1719.0s)]
*  They weren't bad notes at all. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1726.0s)]
*  But it was sort of wanting to explore where the hand came from, explore how to beat it, explore who the demons were. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1727.0s)]
*  And it felt too typical. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1733.0s)]
*  Whereas I really want to the kids to be in out of their depth and over their heads and not understand what it is that they're messing with. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1734.0s)]
*  That was some part of the intrigue of the film. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1739.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1741.0s)]
*  Where did they get that? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1742.0s)]
*  And you don't really explain it that well, which is kind of cool. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1743.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, which is what we wanted to do as well. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1745.0s)]
*  It also seemed like typical like what kids would do if they were partying and someone brought something fucking crazy out. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1747.0s)]
*  There would be a lot of confusion. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1755.0s)]
*  Instead of having a clearly defined origin story of it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1757.0s)]
*  Or like the scene where they go to the library and they dig up the old archive footage or. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1760.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1765.0s)]
*  Back in the day of the 18th century. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1768.0s)]
*  We had we know what it is, but even the kids, they have an idea of what they think the rules are. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1769.0s)]
*  But that's not necessarily the rules. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1774.0s)]
*  That's just what they think they are. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1776.0s)]
*  And everybody's body reacts differently to drugs. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1778.0s)]
*  So one person's experience with weed will be different from another person's experience of weed. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1781.0s)]
*  And so we wanted to sort of have that sort of vibe with the hand. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1785.0s)]
*  Yeah, they've got rules based on like when I do it, you know, like that's it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1787.0s)]
*  Like 90 seconds, you're good, man. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1791.0s)]
*  Like, but depending on your mental state or the way that your body reacts to it, it's going to be very different. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1792.0s)]
*  So and it's also that thing of like how people if you see someone drunk like you with a friend and they're drunk, like you find it funny. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1798.0s)]
*  Like someone's drunk. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1805.0s)]
*  But if they're like, say their family's religious, I remember a friend's family was very religious. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1806.0s)]
*  They came and he was like drunk in his underwear vomiting and we thought it was funny. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1810.0s)]
*  And then I looked over and his mom was crying because like she was like, you know, that's not her perception of it as well. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1814.0s)]
*  It's like that's a that's what it sounds like a devil in a song or something like he was like so like fucked up. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1820.0s)]
*  And that was like sticking as well. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1825.0s)]
*  It's like just different interpretations of what's going on. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1827.0s)]
*  So the kids are having fun with it, but there's that kind of undertone of the reality of it's very different to the way that they're perceiving it. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1829.0s)]
*  So when you're creating something like this, like when you're creating the script and the storyline, do you guys disagree with direction? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1835.0s)]
*  Is it how collaborative is it? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1843.0s)]
*  Well, I can't ever write with Michael. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1845.0s)]
*  We'll just butt heads too much and we'll start fighting. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1847.0s)]
*  So my co-writer, Bill Hinsman, him and I will work on stuff together. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1849.0s)]
*  And then when we've got a draft, we'll present it to Michael. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1852.0s)]
*  And then he just starts fucking tearing into it saying it's boring and shit. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1854.0s)]
*  If you like it because when you're like creating like the story and stuff, if there's no like set ending, I'll have ideas and Danny will as well. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1857.0s)]
*  So it'll kind of be in two different directions. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1865.0s)]
*  I get it could get yanked in two different directions. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1868.0s)]
*  But if Danny does like because we write scripts separately, then there's like the outlines. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1870.0s)]
*  Okay, I know what you're going for. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1874.0s)]
*  And then add notes that way as opposed to like trying to veer into a different thing. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then also writing so personal and you're exploring really personal themes. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1880.0s)]
*  And Michael and I just don't get that deep and personal with each other, even though our brothers would find that really awkward. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1884.0s)]
*  We just don't have that sort of relationship. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1889.0s)]
*  We have more of a working relationship as opposed to. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1891.0s)]
*  And we just look at it's like it's our whole lives is filming and stuff. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1893.0s)]
*  So there's but there's like we don't go, oh, let's go hang out or whatever. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1896.0s)]
*  Like, you know, it's we're always traveling together and stuff. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1900.0s)]
*  We don't like, oh, let's do this together. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1902.0s)]
*  It's always film related. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1904.0s)]
*  And so are you like at the end of it before you start filming, do you guys have to get approval on the final script? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1906.0s)]
*  Is it like, yeah, did they have to give you the green light? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1913.0s)]
*  Like, what is the process between you come up the concept, creating a script, them? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1917.0s)]
*  OK, we're back. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1922.0s)]
*  So do we like continue the sentence like it just happened or no? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1924.0s)]
*  Where were we? Do you remember where we were? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1927.0s)]
*  I tracked something down for you. This is one of the drugs I took. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1930.0s)]
*  What is it? I can't. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1932.0s)]
*  Can you pronounce it? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1935.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1939.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll try to look it up. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1943.0s)]
*  Well, it says phase one single randomized open label study to assess the pharmaceutical. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1945.0s)]
*  Well, I don't even know what this word is. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1952.0s)]
*  Pharmokinetics safety and toler and tolerability of ABP seven eight seven deuterated. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1955.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. This dextro meth or fan hydro bromide quinide sulfate. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1965.0s)]
*  Did you get that one? Healthy volunteers. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1974.0s)]
*  Well, this is what I I thought I was never listening, but I was listening. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1977.0s)]
*  I said, what the fuck they were saying. That's the drug. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1980.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's stuff like that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1982.0s)]
*  I wonder. It sounds like something they're definitely going to pull from the market. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1984.0s)]
*  That sounds like one to get sued for. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1989.0s)]
*  How do you even come up with a name like that? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1993.0s)]
*  Like, oh, it's cool unless it's on purpose to trick people. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1996.0s)]
*  No, scientific. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=1999.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, no. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2001.0s)]
*  It's like every how do we get every letter of the alphabet into something that sounds like that? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2002.0s)]
*  Doesn't even sound like it's a word. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2007.0s)]
*  Yeah, a word. But that's one of the drugs I took. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2008.0s)]
*  That was the one where my arm got paralyzed. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2010.0s)]
*  Sure. So that's OK, though. OK. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2012.0s)]
*  Where were we? We were talking about talk to me. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2015.0s)]
*  We're talking about the process from going from. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2017.0s)]
*  OK, how to get the script picked up to actually shooting. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2021.0s)]
*  So we got past that. We got. Yeah, we got a blackout in the studio. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2024.0s)]
*  So we got to the script gets approval. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2028.0s)]
*  You managed to dodge all the obvious tropes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2032.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I remember going to the studios, the people that financed the. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2037.0s)]
*  The people that financed it were still iffy on us directing. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2041.0s)]
*  They said to Sam, our producer, that I can you what have they done exactly? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2043.0s)]
*  Can you send some stuff? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2048.0s)]
*  But they were still a little bit unsure because it's a big gamble. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2049.0s)]
*  It's so much money. So we sent him the car hit video. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2051.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, we just sent them some examples of a more narrative driven video, which I YouTube videos never really were. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2054.0s)]
*  So it was it was hard. I remember we did a short film called Deluge before we started the YouTube channel. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2061.0s)]
*  So was there talk of someone else taking it over? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2065.0s)]
*  That's what they didn't say. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2067.0s)]
*  So that's the thing is, and one of the reasons we didn't go with the Hollywood studios because they would have final cut and be able to make changes and stuff. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2069.0s)]
*  And yeah, every single like shot and like sound effect and everything was so like, I guess, have like a strong sense of how we want to. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2077.0s)]
*  I couldn't imagine having that control taken away from us. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2085.0s)]
*  Right. So doing it. So we went the independent route, lost half the budget and it was supposed to be an eight week shoot. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2088.0s)]
*  We ended up it dropped to seven and a six and a five. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2095.0s)]
*  So in five weeks, we lost an extra million dollars out of the budget because we cast Sophie Wilde because she wasn't a name yet. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2097.0s)]
*  Like as a lead. So they took a million dollars. Yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2104.0s)]
*  Yeah. She was great. She was incredible. She is the best. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2107.0s)]
*  And now she's doing like she's got a lot like a lot of stuff coming up, which is amazing. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2110.0s)]
*  Like it was worth it to us because she was the best like performer. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2114.0s)]
*  Man, it's such an amazing experience having someone that's like so good at their craft and like elevate it to a point higher than you could imagine in your mind. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2119.0s)]
*  We have a strong thing of like how we want it to be. You get amazing artists like that and they just fucking elevate it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2131.0s)]
*  She was so committed. There were days when we asked her not to sleep and come to set not having slept because her character is losing her mind or she's meant to have been up all night. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2136.0s)]
*  So she would do that. There was a scene where she starts like hitting herself and she was so committed. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2143.0s)]
*  She started beating the crap out of herself for real. She was just so caught up to the character in the moment. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2148.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was like, yeah. And because it was such a short shoot like we had to really and it was it was during COVID was like down but coming back up. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2153.0s)]
*  So if you get if you get COVID then you know you can't come to set for a week or so it was like survival on set like there was one week we lost like seven people and that was on Friday. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2164.0s)]
*  Come Monday there's gonna be no one left like yeah we're just like losing so many people. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2176.0s)]
*  Everyone was constantly getting tested. I mean if the production shut down we weren't going to finish it. We weren't going to make it on budget. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2180.0s)]
*  There was like budget set aside for certain emergency situations but it was like really really tight. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2186.0s)]
*  So we had to reinvest all of our fees back into the film. Our producer reinvested all of our fees back into the film to make sure that we could get Sophie. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2191.0s)]
*  And it was just a race for the finish line. It was so there was days we had to shoot eight minutes of the film in one day. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2197.0s)]
*  Usually on a film it's supposed to be like on average 90 seconds something like that. Yeah. A day of filming. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2203.0s)]
*  So how did the film get so popular? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2209.0s)]
*  So we had a... Was it just word of mouth? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2213.0s)]
*  We got picked up from... So we got into Sundance Film Festival which is like a really prestigious film festival. One of the biggest in the world Sundance. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2216.0s)]
*  And we got into that somehow and then there was I think like word started spreading there. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2225.0s)]
*  So we were getting contacted by like all the agencies like all these big you know talent agencies and we're getting like and they were getting people to like reach out to us. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2231.0s)]
*  We're getting like two three hundred emails a day of like people like oh sign with us like this thing. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2241.0s)]
*  So word was spreading before the movie even no one even saw the movie. I think they spoke to the people at Sundance like what's like a buzz title or something and that came up. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2246.0s)]
*  So when we got there we it was like this chaotic like yeah like a strange everything we're trying to get achieve in our life like being in film was like and like scratching the door forever. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2254.0s)]
*  It just blew open and then everything was like the most fucking surreal. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2266.0s)]
*  It was overwhelming. We spent all of Sundance because we had the crew there and the cast. Everyone was just crying the entire time. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2270.0s)]
*  It was so overwhelming and even all those emails all these people reaching out all these heroes of ours or all these companies that you've seen so many products from saying oh do you want to look at this script. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2276.0s)]
*  Do you want to look at this. It was the first time I got so overwhelmed I couldn't even open emails. I couldn't look or I was so... [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2286.0s)]
*  It just feels surreal. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2292.0s)]
*  Everything like Jordan Peele send a message like randomly and then Ari Aster who did hereditary he came to the premiere and like man it was there was all this hype around the movie before anyone saw I was like man I would have rather it be like you know one knows like you just go in not knowing expecting anything. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2293.0s)]
*  There was this really high expectation going into it. We were sitting in the back of the theater just cringing man like oh like it was the most painful experience because it was it was the first time we were going to be exposed to critics. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2312.0s)]
*  Like harsh critics you know Sundance and things like that and we wanted audience members just in the theater but I think it was all just like industry professionals. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2322.0s)]
*  So it was like it was terrifying. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2332.0s)]
*  I was troughing so bad throughout the screening thinking it was playing like shit. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2334.0s)]
*  Yeah people would get up to go to the toilet and they open the back door and then light would go over the crowd. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2338.0s)]
*  Yeah it's just constantly people are moving around like why is the movie boring why is people moving to the toilet. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2344.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2348.0s)]
*  And it was like a midnight screening as well like they play it at midnight in Egyptian theater it was like a big famous theater and like it was midnight so it was late people like a little bit maybe drunk. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2349.0s)]
*  It was like a weird. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2358.0s)]
*  But yeah that whole night I just remember being really emotional and troughing a lot and cringing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2359.0s)]
*  Trotting? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2364.0s)]
*  In film. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2365.0s)]
*  Peaks and troughs. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2367.0s)]
*  Peaks and troughs. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2368.0s)]
*  Peaks and valleys yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2369.0s)]
*  It was like troughing and feeling really down. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2370.0s)]
*  We went up to Ariasla to apologize to him after the movie. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2371.0s)]
*  I literally got up to say I'm so sorry you got dragged here because of all this hype for no reason. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2374.0s)]
*  I went to apologize to him so I walked up to him I'm like bro I'm so sorry that and he's like that was amazing. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2378.0s)]
*  I was like whoa what the fuck. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2383.0s)]
*  And then he's. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2385.0s)]
*  So you thought it wasn't being received well just because people were distracted and moving around or just you guys were hypersensitive. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2386.0s)]
*  Hypersensitive and focusing on small things. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2392.0s)]
*  Yeah anything that was like you know like a crackle in the speaker or someone going to the toilet was like. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2394.0s)]
*  You know overthinking it was such a very heightened emotional moment that every small thing I was like this is playing like shit. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2400.0s)]
*  So when did you realize that it wasn't? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2406.0s)]
*  When did you realize that this is a hit? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2407.0s)]
*  When at that night our producer said A24 want to make an offer on the film. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2409.0s)]
*  I was like what the fuck A24? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2414.0s)]
*  Which is we would joke about it on set. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2416.0s)]
*  Oh this is very A24 this film this is a very A24 shot. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2418.0s)]
*  You know we're A24? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2421.0s)]
*  No what's that? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2423.0s)]

*  They're like the most prestigious like kind of indie studio thing. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2426.0s)]
*  So like they're really selective with their talent and it's kind of like art films. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2431.0s)]
*  Can you give me an example of a film? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2436.0s)]

*  I know we're stupid than proper film directors. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2468.0s)]

*  That's good. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2475.0s)]

*  You know Rotten Tomatoes. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2574.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2576.0s)]
*  In the 90s 94 percent. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2577.0s)]
*  Yeah I think that's one of the things that I saw when I clicked on it. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2582.0s)]
*  Rotten Tomatoes gave it a really high rating. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2583.0s)]
*  Yeah which is like. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2584.0s)]
*  So I was like I'll give it a try and then we watched the preview and I said fuck yeah let's [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2585.0s)]
*  watch this thing. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2588.0s)]
*  Oh hell yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2589.0s)]
*  It seems so interesting. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2590.0s)]
*  And it was so good. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2591.0s)]
*  You guys nailed it. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2592.0s)]
*  It was so original. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2593.0s)]
*  Like that was the most impressive thing about it is because you're taking this this sort [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2594.0s)]
*  of genre with you know possession and demonic possession and you turned it into this very [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2600.0s)]
*  unique thing. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2607.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2608.0s)]
*  It wasn't like anything else I'd ever seen. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2609.0s)]
*  It was really fucking good man. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2610.0s)]
*  And I'd love the fact that you guys were so young and then it was just it was completely [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2612.0s)]
*  out of your mind. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2618.0s)]
*  You know it wasn't like you were trying to make some derivative thing. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2619.0s)]
*  It was really good man. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2622.0s)]
*  Oh thank you. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2624.0s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2625.0s)]
*  That was the risk. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2626.0s)]
*  Like when we walked away from the studio it's like that was guaranteed theatrical release. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2627.0s)]
*  And we're like oh let's do the indie thing. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2631.0s)]
*  Even shooting in Australia was a thing because Australian movies don't make money. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2633.0s)]
*  When we've reinvested our fees our lawyers like don't do that. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2637.0s)]
*  It's like don't do that. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2639.0s)]
*  Australian movies don't make fucking money. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2640.0s)]
*  He said eight percent of Australian films make their budget back. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2641.0s)]
*  But again like the money thing was like whatever like if we wanted to make the best movie in [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2643.0s)]
*  that was the most authentic thing was doing it in Australia. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2647.0s)]
*  But the accents for some reason don't translate. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2650.0s)]
*  Even Australians don't like watching Australian movies sometimes. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2653.0s)]
*  There's a there's a cultural cringe. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2658.0s)]
*  Because we don't sound cinematic. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2659.0s)]
*  We don't sound epic. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2660.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2661.0s)]
*  But that made it more authentic. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2662.0s)]
*  Like it really was kids just hanging out partying doing something insane. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2664.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2668.0s)]
*  I think there's a take on that as well. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2669.0s)]
*  Like what would kids do if this was real. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2670.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what they'd be doing. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2672.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2674.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2675.0s)]
*  Especially now where it's like you know we all have that kind of thirst for attention [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2676.0s)]
*  and engagement and clicks. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2680.0s)]
*  So your people are doing things to get horrible things to get attention even if it's negative. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2682.0s)]
*  When your moral compass isn't developed yet you're like you're seeing oh this is popularity. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2687.0s)]
*  Even if it's negative I'm still getting attention. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2693.0s)]
*  And it happened to adults as well. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2695.0s)]
*  But Joe Rogan was going to fight Bruce Buffer. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2696.0s)]
*  How long did it take. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2703.0s)]
*  Was it a slow build. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2704.0s)]
*  How long did it take before it hit like 90 million. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2705.0s)]
*  Was it like. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2707.0s)]
*  I think it's been in cinemas for a while now. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2708.0s)]
*  It's still in cinemas right now. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2710.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2712.0s)]
*  But I think every week they like drop it by half the amount of theaters that it plays in. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2713.0s)]
*  And the way they promoted it was like I think A24 does more like. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2718.0s)]
*  And this whole world like making stuff where that's our like whole lives. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2722.0s)]
*  But the stuff after all this stuff I have no idea what. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2727.0s)]
*  Like this is such a new process for us like marketing and releasing all that stuff. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2731.0s)]
*  So I think the way that they. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2734.0s)]
*  If you say Bola we've got a publicist. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2736.0s)]
*  It's our publicist. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2738.0s)]
*  Oh man it was the first time we had like you know like our schedules. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2739.0s)]
*  It's good that we have like management now that gives us a schedule because we have no idea what's happening every second. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2742.0s)]
*  But yeah in a publicity you go to a new thing. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2748.0s)]
*  There's like a list of like 30 interviews that you're doing that day. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2751.0s)]
*  And then like you see like there's some control. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2754.0s)]
*  It was a lot of word of mouth screenings. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2756.0s)]
*  And yeah they didn't do like billboards and things like that. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2758.0s)]
*  That wasn't the way that they promote. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2761.0s)]
*  They did like showing the movie to people that they think would talk about it and then like kind of spread that way I guess. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2762.0s)]
*  It was a word of mouth campaign. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2769.0s)]
*  Yeah word of mouth campaign. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2770.0s)]
*  So it just sort of slowly kept going. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2774.0s)]
*  Because we didn't promote it since Sundance because we got into Sundance which we did that whole thing there. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2775.0s)]
*  Then in February we were in Berlin Film Festival which is a bit more promo there. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2778.0s)]
*  And then March we were in South by Southwest here in Texas. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2782.0s)]
*  And so all those screenings just came word of mouth and then they were just yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2784.0s)]
*  And then around July we did that. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2789.0s)]
*  Yeah and then like I guess it did really good in South America like Mexico, Peru like all those places. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2790.0s)]
*  And they went hard on the marketing. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2797.0s)]
*  There's a company called Diamond Films. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2798.0s)]
*  They made like a giant hand they were parading through the streets. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2800.0s)]
*  It was so fucking awesome. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2802.0s)]
*  I was like man I want to go over there. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2803.0s)]
*  Like I want to get a picture. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2805.0s)]
*  Like they had like a whole like a bus stop where it was like four bus stops with like hands in between them like all in a row for the film. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2806.0s)]
*  Big walls. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2813.0s)]
*  Very expensive. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yeah I was like man next time because we're going to do a sequel. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2815.0s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2818.0s)]
*  You're going to do a sequel now? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2820.0s)]
*  Even when you're writing something like that you get so caught up in the world and with the characters you can't help but start writing scenes for a sequel. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2821.0s)]
*  And so I had ideas for it and I told A24 I said if it's successful I would be so down to do a sequel. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2827.0s)]
*  So I just sort of planted the seed and every Q&A that we did and these like word of mouth screenings I was like you know A24 should give us a I was always just sort of hinting saying I would do it if they wanted to do it. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2834.0s)]
*  That's a big thing now with horror movies where they have all these spin offs. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2843.0s)]
*  Like look at the conjuring. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2846.0s)]
*  How many movies do they have off of that? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2848.0s)]
*  There's a whole cinematic franchise. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2849.0s)]
*  There's a whole conjuring universe. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2850.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2852.0s)]
*  It does help us solidify things in pop culture if you look at Friday the 13th you know with Jason or Freddie. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2853.0s)]
*  But there's two. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2859.0s)]
*  It depends like at what point does it become like a money grab I guess is like a thing or it's. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2860.0s)]
*  Well when you don't want to do it anymore. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2865.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2867.0s)]
*  And you're just doing it for the money. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2868.0s)]
*  Or a cool thing I think would be if people want to because they're talking about if you like imagine a movie where we get a cool talent. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2869.0s)]
*  Like director like Africa writer director and then they do like a version of that world like in like in their surroundings like that would be amazing. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2876.0s)]
*  I'd love that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2885.0s)]
*  Different because it can't be wherever. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2886.0s)]
*  Even when we're with the Japanese distributors they released a film really late. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2888.0s)]
*  It's released it hasn't come out yet. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2891.0s)]
*  It hasn't come out in Japan. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2893.0s)]
*  Japanese cinemas December 22nd. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2894.0s)]
*  But when I was with the Japanese distributors I said I was like if you can think of a director that would want to do a spin I would love to see a Japanese. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2896.0s)]
*  Because that's horror. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2904.0s)]
*  The Japanese horror is the fucking best in the world. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2905.0s)]
*  They have such a there's something about it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2908.0s)]
*  It's like a soul in Japanese horror that you don't get anywhere. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2909.0s)]
*  And culturally as big if you look at so if we got Chuckie and Freddie. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2913.0s)]
*  They're not on that level. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2918.0s)]
*  No. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2919.0s)]
*  So the grudge and the ring you know those are just as as big and prevalent as those things and they all just originate. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2920.0s)]
*  I don't know what the garage is. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2927.0s)]
*  Oh the garage grudge. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2928.0s)]
*  The grudge. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2929.0s)]
*  The garage. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2930.0s)]
*  The garage. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2931.0s)]
*  The garage. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2933.0s)]
*  We talked too fast. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2934.0s)]
*  Did you ever see the ring versus the grudge. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2935.0s)]
*  No. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2937.0s)]
*  That was a real film. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2938.0s)]
*  Was it really. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2939.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2940.0s)]
*  It was like Freddie versus Jason. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2941.0s)]
*  Did you make that movie. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2942.0s)]
*  No I would have. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2943.0s)]
*  But yes. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2944.0s)]
*  There was a good thing about shooting in like shooting the movie. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2945.0s)]
*  All that experience from YouTube. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2952.0s)]
*  We're able to kind of bring that to the set because it was so weird. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2954.0s)]
*  We pulled things off before that we'd like new ways to like pull things off that isn't like the normal way. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2958.0s)]
*  So if we were running under the gun or you know had to you know change things up we were able to do it more on the fly. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2963.0s)]
*  Because we were in we've been in that environment for so long. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2970.0s)]
*  Once we did these commercials in Norway. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2973.0s)]
*  It was one of the random things. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2975.0s)]
*  We did these Norwegian commercials with Magnus. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2977.0s)]
*  Magnus. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2979.0s)]
*  Do you know the chess player Magnus Carlsen. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2980.0s)]
*  So he was in one of them. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2982.0s)]
*  And it was like it was promoting like an Internet brand. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2984.0s)]
*  And we were we went there. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2986.0s)]
*  Alty Box. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2987.0s)]
*  Alty Box. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2989.0s)]
*  So we went there and like we wanted to have like this. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2990.0s)]
*  Exploding bookshelf. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2994.0s)]
*  And that was showing us like special effects like and all that little sparks. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=2996.0s)]
*  And like no dude has to be huge. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3000.0s)]
*  The bookshelf has to explode. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3003.0s)]
*  Massive big. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3006.0s)]
*  It's like 50 of those put together. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3007.0s)]
*  And it's like big. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3009.0s)]
*  And every day we'd see him in pre-production like big has to be big has to be big. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3011.0s)]
*  And then we rocked up. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3015.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3017.0s)]
*  We rocked up on set. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3018.0s)]
*  We rocked up on set. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3020.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3021.0s)]
*  And then the guy the this thing here there. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3022.0s)]
*  That. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3025.0s)]
*  So what happened was we rocked up on set. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3026.0s)]
*  And he's like everyone needs to leave the studio. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3029.0s)]
*  Well like we have to leave the set. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3034.0s)]
*  He's like no everyone needs to leave the studio. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3035.0s)]
*  Like wow what's about to happen. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3037.0s)]
*  And he's like I don't know. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3039.0s)]
*  And he lined this bookshelf with fucking. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3041.0s)]
*  With dead cord or something. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3043.0s)]
*  Something dynamite. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3044.0s)]
*  Because yeah we said big. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3045.0s)]
*  So he like did fucking dynamite or something on the wall. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3046.0s)]
*  We went outside because like leave the studio. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3049.0s)]
*  Like oh fuck. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3052.0s)]
*  We went out all went outside and we all huddled around like a like a monitor that could see inside. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3053.0s)]
*  And then he goes three two one. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3058.0s)]
*  Press the button and the screen goes blank. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3060.0s)]
*  And we're like you see. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3063.0s)]
*  And it was cool. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3065.0s)]
*  And we're like we open the studio door and that just steam started fucking filling out. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3066.0s)]
*  If you look at that explosion it blows a hole in the set. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3071.0s)]
*  And there's. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3074.0s)]
*  What's what's the. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3075.0s)]
*  Yeah what's the background. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3076.0s)]
*  This explosion is fucking huge. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3077.0s)]
*  Is that really a person in there. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3080.0s)]
*  So we got a plate shot. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3081.0s)]
*  We played shot. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3082.0s)]
*  So we did him like reacting without. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3083.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3085.0s)]
*  Yeah but did you see that hole in the set. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3086.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3087.0s)]
*  So there was like big chunks of like wood. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3088.0s)]
*  Like just fucking rickety like it threw the everything. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3091.0s)]
*  And I was like we don't have to leave the set for this. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3093.0s)]
*  But then when that happened he really delivered. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3095.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3098.0s)]
*  Because there was nothing left for that bookshelf. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3099.0s)]
*  I mean it's not selling how big this explosion was but it was fucking huge. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3100.0s)]
*  That was a bookshelf and it was gone. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3104.0s)]
*  It just vanished. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3107.0s)]
*  Poor guy. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3108.0s)]
*  But like it was good. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3109.0s)]
*  All that stuff was just experienced to be like. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3114.0s)]
*  Like one day there's a montage sequence in talk to me. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3115.0s)]
*  That where they're all like having fun like using it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3117.0s)]
*  And like we only had two hours to shoot that whole montage sequence. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3120.0s)]
*  And we had 50 setups to get 50 shots we wanted. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3123.0s)]
*  And we wanted to riff and like you know just like do improvisation. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3126.0s)]
*  And the first AD was telling us you can't it's mathematically impossible to get all these shots in this amount of time. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3129.0s)]
*  And they were like let us control the set for these two hours. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3135.0s)]
*  And we just had a boom box and we were just like we had two cameras and we were just like get in there get out get the frigging get out. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3138.0s)]
*  Make up change go boom boom boom. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3144.0s)]
*  We had jibs and the grips like and we just like had this like momentum. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3146.0s)]
*  And we were able to like just like shoot this. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3149.0s)]
*  And I think that energy translates through the screen. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3151.0s)]
*  Instead of just like you know set up actually you're having fun now. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3153.0s)]
*  No the montage is one of my favorite parts. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3156.0s)]
*  It was just very creative. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3158.0s)]
*  Oh yeah it was so fun. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3160.0s)]
*  And having all the actors riff it and be in that there was a certain energy in the room and capturing it was yeah. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3161.0s)]
*  Yeah I think but then the Sam our producer pulled us aside after that scene. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3166.0s)]
*  She's like this is not how you run a professional film set. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3170.0s)]
*  No but she wasn't being a bitch about it. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3173.0s)]
*  It was true. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3175.0s)]
*  It was the truth. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3176.0s)]
*  It was true because the first AD is like what the hell is happening. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3177.0s)]
*  Everyone's like what are checks. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3179.0s)]
*  I was like don't worry about checks don't worry about this. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3180.0s)]
*  Just trying to know. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3182.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3183.0s)]
*  Once we get to the edit who cares if something's not perfect. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3184.0s)]
*  It was like we need to get every single shot that we want for this. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3187.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3191.0s)]
*  Oh boy this is a cursed interview. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3192.0s)]
*  Does it feel like something's trying to stop this from happening. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3196.0s)]
*  Not really because it keeps starting up again. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3199.0s)]
*  Yeah we just need a break. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3201.0s)]
*  He needs to have a little bit of a break every now and then. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3202.0s)]
*  Joe does that with his guests of shit. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3204.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3205.0s)]
*  Oh it's a buck out. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3206.0s)]
*  Where were we? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3207.0s)]
*  We're talking about the montage sequence. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3209.0s)]
*  I believe. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3211.0s)]
*  Can I just say something. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3212.0s)]
*  Have you ever recorded one and you lost all the footage of like a podcast. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3213.0s)]
*  No no. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3217.0s)]
*  Once we filmed a video for Deadpool promoting Deadpool and we went to like a junction like [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3218.0s)]
*  a junket like a press junket and we didn't know. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3224.0s)]
*  We didn't really do interviews and things like that and they said just do whatever you [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3226.0s)]
*  want. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3232.0s)]
*  So Danny went as like a crazy obsessed fan and he had like this long black wig on. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3233.0s)]
*  And we didn't tell anyone that he was that character. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3237.0s)]
*  And then we went and interviewed like the writers and then one of the actors Danny spoke [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3241.0s)]
*  to as well. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3247.0s)]
*  But we didn't tell them that Danny was this character. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3248.0s)]
*  So like it was really like an awkward like filming thing. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3251.0s)]
*  And we ended up we knew that they wouldn't let us use a lot of it. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3254.0s)]
*  But we ended up losing the footage and like our friend dropped the hard drive and then [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3257.0s)]
*  we fucking lost everything. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3261.0s)]
*  Or we thought we did. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3263.0s)]
*  And we had to tell them because they had us in like Beverly Hills and we're like oh man [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3264.0s)]
*  sorry we don't have the video anymore. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3267.0s)]
*  And then they're like what the fuck. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3269.0s)]
*  But eventually a year later we found the footage like a backup of it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3271.0s)]
*  I don't even know how we had a backup of it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3275.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah and it saved all the footage. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3277.0s)]
*  But it was good because we could upload. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3278.0s)]
*  We uploaded it without approvals. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3280.0s)]
*  But it still was not approved. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3281.0s)]
*  So it was really awkward. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3283.0s)]
*  Anyway that was my random story. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3285.0s)]
*  That was about the montage sequence. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3286.0s)]
*  Yeah the montage sequence was good. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3288.0s)]
*  You got told off. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3290.0s)]
*  Sam told us off but in a nice way because she has to keep things on track. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3291.0s)]
*  Oh Sam's the best producer. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3294.0s)]
*  But that was your flexibility from doing YouTube videos. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3295.0s)]
*  You guys get to shoot things on the fly. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3297.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3299.0s)]
*  And they had to pull certain things off. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3300.0s)]
*  Even like our makeup. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3302.0s)]
*  Our special effects department was so fucking good. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3303.0s)]
*  Yeah makeup effects group. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3305.0s)]
*  They're incredible. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3306.0s)]
*  How did you decide how to have them look when they're being possessed? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3307.0s)]
*  I knew that we didn't want it to feel too elevated and for them to feel and look like corpses. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3311.0s)]
*  You know and so our. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3317.0s)]
*  Well the eyes as well. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3319.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3321.0s)]
*  Did you guys use contact lenses? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3322.0s)]
*  Yeah everything was practical. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3324.0s)]
*  Scaleras. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3325.0s)]
*  Big fat scaleras. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3326.0s)]
*  You know like when you're on like people when they're on like pingers and your iris changes. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3328.0s)]
*  Pingers? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3333.0s)]
*  Pingers mate. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3334.0s)]
*  Bloody it's Australian term. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3335.0s)]
*  It's an Australian term for like. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3336.0s)]
*  Ecstasy or. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3337.0s)]
*  Oh pingers. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3338.0s)]
*  Pingers mate. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3339.0s)]
*  Never heard that one. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3340.0s)]
*  Yeah no. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3341.0s)]
*  Come down to Red Square in Adelaide mate. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3342.0s)]
*  Get some pingers. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3344.0s)]
*  Yeah and so yeah we just wanted to. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3347.0s)]
*  We told them we sat the actors down because makeup. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3349.0s)]
*  VFX always looks really odd around the eyes and you can always tell. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3352.0s)]
*  So we had to sit them down and say it's going to be really uncomfortable. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3355.0s)]
*  But we need everyone to be able to put these proper contact lenses in. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3358.0s)]
*  Like we need to be able to do it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3361.0s)]
*  So I said I will do it as well. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3363.0s)]
*  I will wear these contact lenses in if you do. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3365.0s)]
*  I wore them for like 30 minutes. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3366.0s)]
*  I'm fucking taking them out. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3367.0s)]
*  They're the most uncomfortable things in the world. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3368.0s)]
*  I can imagine. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3370.0s)]
*  Yeah but all the actors around of it and yeah the makeup. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3371.0s)]
*  The makeup Bible. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3374.0s)]
*  And there was so many references of real corpses and real dead bodies. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3375.0s)]
*  And just to try and capture it and make it feel really real and authentic and not too. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3378.0s)]
*  Yeah not too heightened. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3381.0s)]
*  Was the makeup effects. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3383.0s)]
*  Also doing everything practically even with the kid that's pulling his eyeball out of his face. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3384.0s)]
*  We built his face on top of his face so he could interact properly and practically. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3388.0s)]
*  Like a prosthetic face on each face. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3394.0s)]
*  How did you have him slamming his head against things. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3396.0s)]
*  So we did it a few different ways. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3398.0s)]
*  We had the way that we initially thought of which it worked. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3400.0s)]
*  But we had some backups just in case. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3403.0s)]
*  We had like a foam cover of the table. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3406.0s)]
*  So he was just hitting his head on foam. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3408.0s)]
*  And then we did one where we had like a head mold made of him and then we were just slamming that into a real table. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3410.0s)]
*  And we had like blood tubes going through his head and that for blood effects. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3416.0s)]
*  That fucking kid man. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3421.0s)]
*  After six hours of makeup. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3422.0s)]
*  Joe Bird. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3424.0s)]
*  Yeah Joe Bird the kid. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3425.0s)]
*  It just didn't complain once. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3426.0s)]
*  And there were scenes where we were like you have to be out of focus sitting on the bed and he has to go through all those hours of makeup. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3427.0s)]
*  And he just did it without complaining. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3432.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3434.0s)]
*  Long prosthetics. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3435.0s)]
*  But there's something about it like when you do things practically it has like a genuine feel. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3436.0s)]
*  It feels a lot more real. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3441.0s)]
*  Even if audiences don't understand it like base level like what they're looking at. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3442.0s)]
*  Something will just not feel right. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3447.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3448.0s)]
*  Even if you can't verbalize what it is. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3449.0s)]
*  The uncanny valley. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3451.0s)]
*  The uncanny valley. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3452.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3453.0s)]
*  Oh come on. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3454.0s)]
*  Sorry mate. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3455.0s)]
*  What's the uncanny valley. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3456.0s)]
*  There's just something off about it. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3457.0s)]
*  When you see CGI footage that's not quite there. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3459.0s)]
*  It's not quite a real person and you kind of know something's off. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3467.0s)]
*  Even if you. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3468.0s)]
*  You know what. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3469.0s)]
*  It's the same with things with like sound and things like that. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3470.0s)]
*  If you and people will not be able to say what it is if you're not like a like a filmmaker. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3472.0s)]
*  But you just feel the uncanny valley. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3477.0s)]
*  You know if you've ever seen a photograph of a model car and you know it's a model car. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3484.0s)]
*  Why is that. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3485.0s)]
*  Yeah it's true. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3486.0s)]
*  Like let's get an example of that. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3487.0s)]
*  Get a photo of a model car like just say model 1974 Trans Am. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3489.0s)]
*  There's something about the model like where you're looking at it and it looks perfect. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3496.0s)]
*  But you go something's wrong. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3502.0s)]
*  Is it the way the lighting of a light. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3504.0s)]
*  I don't know but it's almost impossible to describe. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3506.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3509.0s)]
*  But I can tell like if someone sends me like a photo or if I look at it on Google I can look at a tiny photograph on my phone and go oh that's a model car. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3510.0s)]
*  It's not a real car. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3518.0s)]
*  There's you know those miniatures and films when they build a small version of something big. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3519.0s)]
*  So like a like a house that gets destroyed by Godzilla. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3524.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3529.0s)]
*  But they do a thing called bigotry but they make it a little bit. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3530.0s)]
*  What are these Jamie. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3532.0s)]
*  These are model cars and they just have it superimposed. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3533.0s)]
*  I cannot tell. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3536.0s)]
*  Yeah I can't tell there. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3538.0s)]
*  That's but that's trick for. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3540.0s)]
*  Or there I can tell. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3542.0s)]
*  See what I'm saying. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3543.0s)]
*  It's the light. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3544.0s)]
*  No it's not. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3545.0s)]
*  It's the size of the ground. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3546.0s)]
*  Yeah but that's just because of the ground. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3547.0s)]
*  But if that was on just concrete it would be the same effect. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3549.0s)]
*  Yeah it's the lighting. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3552.0s)]
*  You can see the paint. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3553.0s)]
*  Right that one. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3554.0s)]
*  That's a good example. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3555.0s)]
*  Why can I. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3557.0s)]
*  Why can I. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3558.0s)]
*  Well that's a shitty one. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3559.0s)]
*  That's a shitty model car. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3560.0s)]
*  See if there's some other examples Jamie. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3562.0s)]
*  I mean other examples on Google. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3567.0s)]
*  Oh there's one there to the right right. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3569.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3573.0s)]
*  Oh that's a perfect example. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3574.0s)]
*  Why does that look fake. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3575.0s)]
*  Dude I do think it's because it's clearly on the floor on the ground. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3576.0s)]
*  I think it's got to do with it's the what's surrounding it and the way that the light. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3580.0s)]
*  And also because it doesn't have like the amount of I guess like like little creases in light like shining off it than a than a normal car would like. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3584.0s)]
*  There'd be a lot more light bouncing off it I guess. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3592.0s)]
*  It would represent more surface area. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3595.0s)]
*  Yeah we used to. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3598.0s)]
*  The variation in the light would represent more surface area. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3599.0s)]
*  Yeah when we were kids we used to put toy cars and blow them up and we thought it would look cool. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3602.0s)]
*  That's a shitty version. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3607.0s)]
*  It really didn't. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3608.0s)]
*  How about that one that red one. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3609.0s)]
*  This one. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3610.0s)]
*  Yeah click on that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3611.0s)]
*  Well that's on hardwood you can tell. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3612.0s)]
*  That's just. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3614.0s)]
*  I feel like that was when it's composed in like that other thing is it's harder to tell. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3615.0s)]
*  Well it's better than CG. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3619.0s)]
*  Oh damn. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3623.0s)]
*  That's a tough one. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3624.0s)]
*  That looks fake. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3625.0s)]
*  It looks little. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3627.0s)]
*  Yeah it does look a little small. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3628.0s)]
*  But why. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3630.0s)]
*  Fuck it's a good question. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3631.0s)]
*  I'm stumped. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3633.0s)]
*  But it does. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3634.0s)]
*  Yeah it does. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3635.0s)]
*  It has to be it has to make it has a plastic look. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3636.0s)]
*  That's why they do the biggatures because it needs to be a little bit bigger than this. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3639.0s)]
*  This is too small. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3641.0s)]
*  But is it the light the way the light reflects off of it. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3642.0s)]
*  Does it in your head does it generate this idea of a smaller thing. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3646.0s)]
*  That's my theory is that the level of detail and the light. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3651.0s)]
*  Yeah it's the light because it's like. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3654.0s)]
*  But this is kind of blurry but still I'm looking at it I'm like that looks fake. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3655.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3659.0s)]
*  Click on the ones right there. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3660.0s)]
*  Those right there. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3661.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3662.0s)]
*  Those all look fake. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3663.0s)]
*  Why. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3664.0s)]
*  It's because of the background as well. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3665.0s)]
*  Like we're clearly looking at something that is a model. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3667.0s)]
*  But that could easily be you know just some sort of a matte black floor and a black background. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3669.0s)]
*  And they look like you know what it kind of like you can see the white. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3677.0s)]
*  It feels you don't feel the white or something about it. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3682.0s)]
*  They look light. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3685.0s)]
*  They look like. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3686.0s)]
*  I don't know man. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3687.0s)]
*  I feel like if we put that into a proper background like that of a picture it'd be harder to tell. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3688.0s)]
*  I think so too. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3692.0s)]
*  I think definitely this white car in the left would be the hardest to tell. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3693.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3697.0s)]
*  For some reason that one seems the most real to me. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3698.0s)]
*  Whereas there's something about the rough car the yellow car that just seems fake. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3699.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3704.0s)]
*  It just seems small. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3705.0s)]
*  I think it's the detail like the color is just like it's like pure full yellow. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3706.0s)]
*  There's nothing else like to see it. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3711.0s)]
*  Is that a model car. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3713.0s)]
*  That looks like it's pretty. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3714.0s)]
*  No because it's bigger. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3715.0s)]
*  That's a 1.4. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3716.0s)]
*  See that if you zoom out it's a 1.4 model. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3717.0s)]
*  It's bigger so there's more light reflecting in things. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3719.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3723.0s)]
*  Okay so that's it. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3724.0s)]
*  Instead of like one piece of like you like that yellow one. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3725.0s)]
*  You're saying it so short you could be completely wrong. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3727.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's no but I think he's right. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3729.0s)]
*  I think if it was a matte car like it was matte paint it would be more difficult to. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3731.0s)]
*  That's why that's why those Lord of the Rings miniatures and bigatures. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3736.0s)]
*  They still look good. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3739.0s)]
*  Yeah the bigger ones. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3740.0s)]
*  That's 1.24. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3741.0s)]
*  Oh shit that looks real to me. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3742.0s)]
*  Really. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3746.0s)]
*  The seats look fake. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3747.0s)]
*  The seats look fake but everything else looks real. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3748.0s)]
*  That looks pretty real. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3750.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying though. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3751.0s)]
*  Oh definitely. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3754.0s)]
*  And that's the thing with movies. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3755.0s)]
*  The fuck is that? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3756.0s)]
*  You can never. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3757.0s)]
*  What is that? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3758.0s)]
*  What is that? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3759.0s)]
*  Click it. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3760.0s)]
*  No that's. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3761.0s)]
*  That's how you cut on the wrong wall. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3762.0s)]
*  Which is getting you cut down a clicking rabbit hole. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3763.0s)]
*  Yeah we're going to go to rabbit hole. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3764.0s)]
*  How do we get on the subject? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3765.0s)]
*  We'll talk about VFX and uncanny valley. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3766.0s)]
*  Fake things. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3767.0s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3768.0s)]
*  When we're recording that makeup you have to roll for like five to ten minutes to try [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3770.0s)]
*  and grab something that looks realistic for you know one second. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3782.44s)]
*  You just keep rolling. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3786.52s)]
*  Oh move that. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3787.52s)]
*  Change your eye here. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3788.52s)]
*  Look over here. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3789.52s)]
*  Move your hand up here. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3790.52s)]
*  You're just trying to find those magic frames and lingering on it will take away from the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3791.52s)]
*  effect when you're just trying to stay on it for too long. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3793.64s)]
*  But having those flashes of violence. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3795.6s)]
*  You don't have that. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3797.8s)]
*  Yeah like yeah. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3798.8s)]
*  And not. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3799.8s)]
*  I think it's also not lingering on things to be like oh look what we've done. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3800.8s)]
*  And then like lingering on like an impressive effect or anything like that. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3804.4s)]
*  I appreciate movies more when they show something that's really impressive but they don't just [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3808.0s)]
*  like keep cutting back to it or show it forever. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  There's like only just flashes of it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3814.88s)]
*  That would have fucking taken forever but they only showed it for like a second you [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3816.92s)]
*  know. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3820.96s)]
*  I love that stuff in movies. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3821.96s)]
*  Which probably does suck for the prosthetic department. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3822.96s)]
*  It does. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3825.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like Megafx team. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3826.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3827.9199999999996s)]
*  Because they like the drowned woman. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3828.9199999999996s)]
*  They put all this like effort into it. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3830.08s)]
*  It took a long time to do. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3832.16s)]
*  Bloated face everything. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3833.56s)]
*  And she's on screen for like 15 frames. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3835.08s)]
*  But as an effect of 15 frames. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3838.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3840.6s)]
*  It stays with you longer. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3841.6s)]
*  It lingers. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3842.6s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3843.6s)]
*  And what was cool about doing all the YouTube stuff as well. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3844.6s)]
*  Our makeup artist, Bec Burado, who would help us do all the YouTube stuff for free, were [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3846.56s)]
*  able to get her as a head of department on the film. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3850.48s)]
*  And know that she can pull stuff off. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3853.6s)]
*  Even though she hasn't got the experience of being a head of department on all these [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3855.52s)]
*  other films. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3857.68s)]
*  We could vouch to our producers and say no we've been doing this for years with her. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3858.68s)]
*  And she's super committed and she's super talented. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3863.12s)]
*  There's a video that we did where we recreated Mortal Kombat fatalities. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3865.4s)]
*  And it's the most graphic violent thing ever. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3869.48s)]
*  And she would help pull these effects off. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3871.36s)]
*  That was like the crazy. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3873.12s)]
*  Corey Emery as well is one of the guys that helped us design all these effects. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3874.72s)]
*  Are you allowed to show super violent on here or not really? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3877.52s)]
*  What? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3879.96s)]
*  Are you allowed to show super violent stuff? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3880.96s)]
*  Sure. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3882.28s)]
*  Can you look up? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3883.28s)]
*  Rakaraka Mortal Kombat fatality. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3884.96s)]
*  He's already on it mate. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3886.6800000000003s)]
*  Go a little further in. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  A little further in. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3889.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah here we are. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3891.32s)]
*  Oh yeah there we are. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3892.32s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3893.32s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3894.32s)]
*  Are you seeing that? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3895.32s)]
*  So. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3900.32s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3901.32s)]
*  But like all these small effects here like the thing in his head. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3903.32s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3910.84s)]
*  Can you try to do this school? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3914.84s)]
*  Mum's fast out. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3915.84s)]
*  But it's those really exaggerated effects when you're shooting all that stuff. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3917.84s)]
*  You can try and when you're trying to make something look super realistic. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3920.84s)]
*  Practicing with the exaggerated stuff helps. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3924.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah because then you can do that to the. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3925.48s)]
*  This is like showing ridiculous Mortal Kombat fatalities. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3927.5600000000004s)]
*  In real life. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3930.36s)]
*  They're very sticky. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3932.5600000000004s)]
*  Two day shoot. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3934.2400000000002s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3935.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3936.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah you get the idea. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3937.2400000000002s)]
*  I get the idea. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3940.2400000000002s)]
*  Ultra violence. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3941.2400000000002s)]
*  I think all those super elevated things helps with the smaller stuff. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3943.2s)]
*  Yeah and you know the way to kind of shoot practically and stuff. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3946.2s)]
*  Like we did the. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3949.2s)]
*  It's a lot more grounded in. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3950.2s)]
*  And people say that it was like too far sometimes in Talk To Me. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3952.2s)]
*  But we could have made that scene go for three times longer. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3957.2s)]
*  And like smash into space. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3960.2s)]
*  Who said it was too far? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3961.2s)]
*  People like. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3962.2s)]
*  In a screening people fainted in the cinema. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3963.2s)]
*  For one of the screenings. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3965.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3966.2s)]
*  It was the coolest thing ever. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3967.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3968.2s)]
*  That was perfect. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3969.2s)]
*  Did you guys love horror movies before you made this? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3971.16s)]
*  Were you fans of the genre? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3974.16s)]
*  It's always that thing when you're growing up and you're not allowed to watch something. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3975.16s)]
*  It makes you want to watch it. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3978.16s)]
*  My mom was so specific over certain classifications that we can't watch. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3979.16s)]
*  Yeah you could only watch PG. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3982.16s)]
*  PG. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3983.16s)]
*  They're like medium level violence. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3984.16s)]
*  No low level violence. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3985.16s)]
*  It's different in Australia the ratings. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3986.16s)]
*  But it was like medium level violence. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3987.16s)]
*  Low level violence. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3989.16s)]
*  Like we weren't allowed to watch. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3990.16s)]
*  But there was a certain low level violence. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3991.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3993.16s)]
*  It was a thrill to defying mom and being like I'm going to watch this. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3994.16s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3997.16s)]
*  I'm going to watch this. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=3998.16s)]
*  I'm going to watch this fucking thing. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4000.12s)]
*  But it's different because dad wouldn't give a fuck. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4001.12s)]
*  They split up all very young. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4003.12s)]
*  He'd like watch whatever you want. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4004.12s)]
*  And mom was like you can't watch anything. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4005.12s)]
*  And we had a grandfather who spoke no English. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4008.12s)]
*  And we'd take him to the video store and we'd get him to get us the R rated stuff. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4011.12s)]
*  Like the adult stuff. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4015.12s)]
*  And then he got told off. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4016.12s)]
*  Even dad was like you can't get him R. You can't get him that stuff. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4018.12s)]
*  And then he got told off. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4022.12s)]
*  And then we got him to get cartoons instead. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4024.12s)]
*  Like anime. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4026.12s)]
*  Violent anime. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4027.12s)]
*  Like the blood spraying and stuff. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4029.08s)]
*  And then he got told off. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4030.08s)]
*  Dad's like no that's too much. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4032.08s)]
*  And he's like it's a cartoon. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4034.08s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4035.08s)]
*  It's a cartoon. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4036.08s)]
*  So he wouldn't be able to tell you. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4037.08s)]
*  I used to love Peter. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4038.08s)]
*  Yeah I loved him. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4039.08s)]
*  I got him to give me the Exodus book. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4040.08s)]
*  I led him to all those R rated films. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4041.08s)]
*  He would always buy it for us. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4043.08s)]
*  He would never understand. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4044.08s)]
*  And then you just say yeah dad said it's okay. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4045.08s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4046.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4047.08s)]
*  Always that imagination when you look at things like the Goosebump covers from R.L. Stein [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4048.08s)]
*  or if you go into the VHS. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4052.08s)]
*  When you're looking at all those covers of horror films you're making up on your head. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4053.08s)]
*  When you go to the horror film section like in the video stores back in the day kids. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4058.04s)]
*  You know you go in there and the horror section like what the fuck is happening in that movie. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4063.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4067.04s)]
*  Your imagination runs wild. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4068.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4069.04s)]
*  And then you're. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4070.04s)]
*  We're just trying to capture that magic. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4071.04s)]
*  And I remember there was always this fun to being thrilled or watching something you weren't [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4072.04s)]
*  supposed to see. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4075.56s)]
*  Did you have one when you were a kid that scarred you? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4076.56s)]
*  Yeah what was your traumatic childhood film? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4078.56s)]
*  Oh I don't know. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4080.2s)]
*  I loved horror movies when I was a kid. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4081.2s)]
*  I didn't have like a traumatic terrifying one. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4083.2s)]
*  Well you didn't watch one that fucked you up as a kid? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4086.0s)]
*  No. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4087.92s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4088.92s)]
*  No they don't really fuck me up. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4089.92s)]
*  Man it did. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4090.92s)]
*  Damn. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4091.92s)]
*  We had a lady that used to take us to when we were like 11 to go see the adult movies [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4092.92s)]
*  like the horror movies and she took us to see Texas Chainsaw Mass Car 2003. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4097.04s)]
*  The remake. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4102.32s)]
*  The remake. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4103.32s)]
*  And the theater guy's like the lady's like are you sure because they're too young to [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4104.32s)]
*  go watch. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4108.88s)]
*  She's like yeah they're fine. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4109.88s)]
*  And then we went in there and then I had to leave. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4110.88s)]
*  I felt sick. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4113.04s)]
*  And I felt sick because I was like we're trying to be mature and show that we can't handle [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4114.08s)]
*  these movies. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4117.08s)]
*  Michael runs out. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4118.08s)]
*  And then the theater owner's like told ya. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4119.08s)]
*  And I was like fucking. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4121.56s)]
*  So scared. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4122.56s)]
*  I heard Chainsaws for fucking a while. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4123.56s)]
*  I literally heard it's fucking Chainsaw at home and it wasn't even there. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4126.8s)]
*  Do you guys think back now on all these influences and all these things that happened and how [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4130.64s)]
*  it sort of led up to you making films like this? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4135.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4138.28s)]
*  Because it's all the resistance, all the don't watch this, all the telling you what to do. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4139.28s)]
*  So many different things. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4144.320000000001s)]
*  Because I remember. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4145.320000000001s)]
*  Since mum was so specific on what we could watch with the classifications, I started [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4146.320000000001s)]
*  collecting movie classifications. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4149.72s)]
*  I was like oh. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4151.72s)]
*  I would break down and have a booklet of different film classifications. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4153.56s)]
*  See he's weird. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4157.320000000001s)]
*  He was one or two bad turns away from being like a serial killer. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4158.320000000001s)]
*  I used to collect things that scared me. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4161.0s)]
*  So if there was news articles of stuff of killers and murderers I would cut that out [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4162.52s)]
*  and collect it in a scrapbook. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4166.360000000001s)]
*  And mum and all the teachers are so concerned. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4167.92s)]
*  Like what the fuck is this? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4169.88s)]
*  But I was sort of obsessing on it and trying to figure out what scared about it and collecting [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4171.5599999999995s)]
*  it made it less scary or something. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4175.08s)]
*  But yeah I was weird. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4176.44s)]
*  Yeah and then also like that's the same thing. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4177.44s)]
*  These things that influence you from early childhood that you don't even realise. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4180.68s)]
*  But I think a lot of it has to do with your parents or something. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4184.44s)]
*  Like we're affected in ways we don't even understand from such an early age. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4188.36s)]
*  It only comes out down the line. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4193.16s)]
*  That's where everyone goes like, everyone has the childhood traumas right. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4194.16s)]
*  It feels like you are, everyone has a childhood trauma whether their parents weren't there [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4198.28s)]
*  or they were there or they were too nurturing and then you can't go into the real world. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4203.04s)]
*  There's like little things that change you and you don't even realise that they are. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4207.36s)]
*  What was the turn the garage door shuts? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4211.599999999999s)]
*  Anything that happens to you before you turn 13, 12 and under, that's with you now. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4213.28s)]
*  It's part of you. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4216.96s)]
*  So yeah I don't know there's all those little things and those influences and references. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4218.12s)]
*  Yeah and then like our, and it's just things that you are scared of as well that you write [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4221.36s)]
*  into the film. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4225.5199999999995s)]
*  Like mental health, it runs in the family, like deep depression. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4226.72s)]
*  Our mother's mum took her own life when she was like 6. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4232.12s)]
*  And mum has like real dark deep falls into that as well. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4237.56s)]
*  And then you start thinking is that hereditary? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4244.6s)]
*  That's probably why she wants you watching those movies. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4246.6s)]
*  Yeah maybe yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4250.12s)]
*  There's so many different things but you look at that and you see a reoccurring pattern [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4251.12s)]
*  and you're like is that my fate? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4255.5199999999995s)]
*  And yeah it is in your head, it is part of you, it's part of your genes, it's genetic. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4257.4s)]
*  But then also things like I guess like everything we see is like a film scene or something so [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4262.12s)]
*  it's like always just ideas going, stemming from all different things. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4267.12s)]
*  When I start writing I have to get into a certain head space to write. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4270.16s)]
*  I could never just sit down and be like okay I've got two hours free I'm going to write [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4274.08s)]
*  now. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4277.32s)]
*  I have to get into a certain head space. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4278.32s)]
*  If I'm writing a scene where characters are depressed like I feel like I need to get a [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4279.84s)]
*  little bit depressed. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4283.48s)]
*  When I was writing this new thing that I'm working on it was sort of staying up for two [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4285.5199999999995s)]
*  days straight, not sleeping, watching things that freaked me out and then doing things [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4290.04s)]
*  in real life that would try and scare me. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4293.48s)]
*  Like murder people? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  No not like murder people. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4296.5199999999995s)]
*  Like if I was, I would stay up all night, I remember I would walk around in the neighbourhoods [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  at night, I would go for drives all night, late at night and I have conversations with [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4301.88s)]
*  people that aren't there. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4306.48s)]
*  I'm so caught up in it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4307.48s)]
*  If I've got a character that I'm writing I can sit down and talk to them in the car. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4308.86s)]
*  So I'll be driving and talking to this person that's not there. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4312.28s)]
*  And then I'm like I remember there was someone that lost their life at this cliff. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4314.48s)]
*  It was probably like 2am, this was like a month or so ago. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4317.759999999999s)]
*  I drove out to that cliff at like 3am in the morning and I went up there and I'm talking [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4321.639999999999s)]
*  to someone that's not there but on this cliff edge and getting myself into this weird state [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4326.879999999999s)]
*  where I'm a bit freaked out. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4331.599999999999s)]
*  And I was like okay I'm talking to this character that's here, let's say someone that we know [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4333.28s)]
*  died here and we're trying to connect with this person. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4337.12s)]
*  It's like alright let's do it again with that friend that I'm with, the imaginary one, what [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4338.879999999999s)]
*  if he died and I'm trying to connect with him and run through scenarios in real life [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4342.8s)]
*  and just do things that try to freak me out. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4347.52s)]
*  I think we've found the side effects of those drugs. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4350.12s)]
*  Are you guys now kind of committed to this sort of genre or do you want to make all kinds [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4352.88s)]
*  of films? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4357.68s)]
*  All kinds of stuff. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4358.68s)]
*  We're developing Street Fighter at the moment, the video game into a film. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4359.68s)]
*  And for me I like going to environments like that. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4367.12s)]
*  I travelled to Thailand and I was trying to find Sagat who's in the game, he's based on [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4370.5599999999995s)]
*  a real person and he still does private sessions, Muay Thai. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4375.92s)]
*  So I was like training and I had like little clues of where he was so I was like travelling [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4380.04s)]
*  around and like training Muay Thai and then speaking with people and trying to find the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4384.92s)]
*  real life Sagat. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4388.8s)]
*  And then like that, being in that environment just helps with like writing and ideas like [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4390.12s)]
*  that. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4393.84s)]
*  Like immersing yourself in the world like really helps. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4394.84s)]
*  Talking to people that are like the characters that you're writing. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4399.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah they are. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4402.36s)]
*  I found a family of like 12 kids that grew up all fighters and two of them are like world [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4403.36s)]
*  champions now. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4409.5199999999995s)]
*  They're just like at the backyard of their house and they just fucking fight every day. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4410.5199999999995s)]
*  And like they had to fight to eat and like I remember talking to one Mimi, her name is, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4414.4s)]
*  she's champion now. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4420.4s)]
*  And she's like, because there were so many kids in the family with such low incomes, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4421.4s)]
*  if I wanted something special I needed to fight. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4424.88s)]
*  That's the only way we could afford it. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4428.320000000001s)]
*  So that world is like it's just so much inspiration that you get from stories and people. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4430.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, spend time with people. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4434.72s)]
*  That's why I think action would be funner. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4435.72s)]
*  What is the horror thing and you're too often going into a weird mental headspace. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4436.72s)]
*  It's so unhealthy and you can feel it being unhealthy. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4441.200000000001s)]
*  You know, like on your mental health. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4443.72s)]
*  Where I'm like I can feel my sanity slip away if I want to let go of it when you get into [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4446.52s)]
*  those zones. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4449.8s)]
*  When you guys wrote Talk to Me, did you try to talk to someone who's had experiences with [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4450.8s)]
*  the supernatural? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4454.52s)]
*  So many people like that. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4455.52s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4456.52s)]
*  I remember I had one friend that went through a really extreme trauma and he told me about [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  this kinesiologist that made him levitate off this table. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4464.0s)]
*  He's like, and this is someone that doesn't bullshit. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4469.400000000001s)]
*  It's not someone that just says things to say things. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4471.64s)]
*  I really trust what this friend says. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4473.280000000001s)]
*  And he's like, Danny, I'm telling you I was levitating off the table and I just couldn't [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4475.8s)]
*  stop crying afterwards. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4479.160000000001s)]
*  And he said that there was a demon attached to him and this woman, this kinesiologist [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4481.0s)]
*  pulled it out of him. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4484.56s)]
*  I was like, I really want to speak to this woman. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4486.26s)]
*  I need to go talk to her. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4488.06s)]
*  So I set aside three hours. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4489.58s)]
*  I bought three hours of her and I sat down and had a big conversation. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4492.22s)]
*  She's like, yes, I'm seeing these things that are attached to you. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4495.26s)]
*  I'm pulling them off. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4497.14s)]
*  Oh, it's an octopus monster. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4498.14s)]
*  It's a this, it's a that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4500.14s)]
*  And it felt too crazy. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4501.38s)]
*  And she was doing stuff. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4502.900000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I do not believe this at all. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4503.900000000001s)]
*  But then I look back on this friend who had this really extreme trauma and I feel like [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4504.900000000001s)]
*  he attached it to that. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4509.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4512.06s)]
*  The source of this, the reason why this happened is this being that is attached to me and [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4513.46s)]
*  this person I want to believe is pulling this thing off of me now. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4518.620000000001s)]
*  And it's something that's really cathartic about it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4522.820000000001s)]
*  And it's an emotional thing as opposed to an actual spiritual thing. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4524.54s)]
*  What do you think about the levitating part? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4529.14s)]
*  I think that he was in a really heightened emotional state. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4531.38s)]
*  And so he believed that was happening when actually maybe it wasn't. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4534.620000000001s)]
*  That's my theory. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4538.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4539.18s)]
*  And what is the thing like, that's the thing with supernatural. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4540.18s)]
*  If you open your mind up to it, I feel like even if it's not happening, you will kind [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4542.04s)]
*  of think that it is in your mind. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4547.78s)]
*  If you go into a room, I love saying haunted places. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4550.04s)]
*  If there's a haunted place nearby, I love just going, oh, this room's haunted. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4553.24s)]
*  I'm like, oh, can I sleep in there? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4557.32s)]
*  I want to experience whatever. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4558.32s)]
*  If you go into that room and not know, and you'll just have a normal night. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4560.8s)]
*  But if you go in there like, oh, someone was murdering this room and there's a noise that [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4565.2s)]
*  happens at this time. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4568.4s)]
*  You open yourself up to be like hypersensitive to any kind of reaction for anything. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4570.0199999999995s)]
*  I remember I went to this place called Kapunda in South Australia, which is a town of I think [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4574.74s)]
*  like houses that they bring over from like different places. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4580.82s)]
*  And it was like haunted for some reason. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4585.139999999999s)]
*  And the church was haunted. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4587.219999999999s)]
*  And the back room of the church was the most haunted. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4588.9s)]
*  So we were in this room like 2 a.m. in the morning. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4591.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're like, who wants to go in the back room and talk to the spirit, Fred, his name [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4593.54s)]
*  is. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4597.86s)]
*  I will. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4599.259999999999s)]
*  And then I sat in this dark room and we had like these infrared cameras. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4599.94s)]
*  And I was sitting there and I was like talking to Fred. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4604.86s)]
*  I'm like, hey, Fred, do you want to make a noise for me? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4606.94s)]
*  Do you want to throw me across the room? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4611.139999999999s)]
*  You know, everyone says you're real. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4614.179999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4615.94s)]
*  And then I heard like a click and my heart just fucking sank. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4617.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, am I? I sat there. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4621.58s)]
*  I was like, I'll get the fuck out of this room. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4622.98s)]
*  And I went and just left. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4624.42s)]
*  But if I had that same experience, not knowing that, I would have heard a noise like, oh, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4625.74s)]
*  it's whatever. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4630.38s)]
*  Right. The power of suggestion. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4631.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4632.66s)]
*  So it's playing tricks on you. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4633.66s)]
*  Yeah. I spoke to a psychic once and I said, how do you how much is it mental perception [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4634.86s)]
*  as opposed to reality? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4639.66s)]
*  And she said. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4641.0599999999995s)]
*  When I go into it, because she does like readings of houses and stuff where someone's lost their [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4643.0599999999995s)]
*  life or something like stuff like that, she goes like rid ghosts out of houses. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4647.179999999999s)]
*  And she said, I know it's real when I go to a room, I don't know the history of the house [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4651.62s)]
*  and I'll have a feeling that there's something here, some presence, something about a little [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4657.62s)]
*  boy that I just felt that in my room and he's sad and all this. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4662.3s)]
*  And then later I do research and then find out that little boy died in that room. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4666.58s)]
*  I still do not believe it. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4671.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4673.18s)]
*  That's the thing is, if it is real, the amount of like bullshit is around, it's like that's [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4674.18s)]
*  99 percent. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4678.26s)]
*  Who was the one? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4679.26s)]
*  Psychic that died and then they got their wife to give them a code word and they traveled [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4680.3s)]
*  around to all the most famous mediums in the world and had a code word that him and his [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4683.62s)]

*  They're like, go and talk to these psychics, these mediums and like, OK, is there a oh, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4691.34s)]
*  your wife is here talking to her. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4695.42s)]
*  He's like, OK, what is she saying? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4698.02s)]
*  A code word like, oh, no, no, you know, I can't really connect. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4700.22s)]
*  Oh, we're disconnecting from the spirit. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4706.02s)]

*  thing. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4715.5s)]

*  That was the one where he's like, I put a code word up. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4718.5s)]
*  I think it was Houdini. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4721.5s)]

*  You think people can. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4752.42s)]
*  I think it is very possible that occasionally people can tune in and perceive information [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4754.78s)]
*  that's not readily available. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4763.38s)]
*  I think that it's very possible that places have memory and that there's something about [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4765.5s)]
*  traumatic events and spectacular events that lead leave like almost a stain in a place. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4771.14s)]
*  It is feel strange. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4778.06s)]

*  And I don't know what that is. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4784.9800000000005s)]
*  I would it might be coincidence, but it might not be. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4786.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4790.46s)]
*  It might be an emerging property of the human mind. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4791.46s)]
*  So if you think about many of the emergency, like language, how did it be developed over [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4794.86s)]
*  to even eyesight had to eventually be developed? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4799.7s)]
*  Did you know if single celled organisms didn't have it? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4802.98s)]
*  What's my fucking watch? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4805.42s)]
*  Keep going on. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4806.34s)]

*  These annoying fucking things. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4810.46s)]
*  But I think that it's very unlikely that these people that call themselves psychics have [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4812.099999999999s)]
*  any real ability. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4819.82s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=4839.22s)]

*  And I just couldn't stop shaking in hospital. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5001.78s)]
*  So I was like trembling, trembling. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5003.86s)]
*  They were turning on all the heaters, giving me extra blankets, doing anything they could [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5004.86s)]
*  to get me warm. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5008.139999999999s)]
*  I just would not stop shaking. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5009.62s)]
*  And then my sister came in to visit me. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5011.54s)]
*  She sat next to me and she held my hand. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5013.66s)]
*  And then the shaking just stopped. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5015.94s)]
*  And it was just that moment, like the power of her touch pulled me out of this state of [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5017.82s)]
*  shock that I was in. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5021.7s)]
*  And just, yeah, hands and connection and all that was in the first draft of the script. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5023.42s)]
*  It was so prevalent. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5028.62s)]
*  It was the main theme of the film. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5029.780000000001s)]
*  So it just felt right to be our object of horror. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5031.3s)]
*  And did you try to... [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5033.54s)]
*  Did you have different ideas about where the hand came from? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5034.54s)]
*  Oh, dude, we've got an entire mythology Bible that breaks down everything. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5037.42s)]
*  Where it came from, who it went to, everyone that's ever had it. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5040.9400000000005s)]
*  We've broken down everything. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5043.860000000001s)]
*  Every spirit that connected with each kid, why they were drawn to each of those kids, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5044.900000000001s)]
*  what emotions were they connecting to. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5048.5s)]
*  So we've like blocked all that out. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5050.780000000001s)]
*  So I see a draft delivered and then I have... [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5052.42s)]
*  The script's exactly the same. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5054.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but the pitch Bible, the mythology Bible's different, guys. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5055.9400000000005s)]
*  They're like, they have a draft of the script on. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5060.14s)]
*  I was like, yes, but this mythology Bible. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5061.74s)]
*  It was just so much fun to... [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5063.58s)]
*  That's never gonna be on screen. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5064.58s)]
*  Why are you... [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5065.58s)]
*  Because it's fun to explore and have just little hints at the history of it. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5066.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5068.900000000001s)]
*  So I think for the sequel, we can explore that a little bit more. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5069.900000000001s)]
*  But even with the sequel, we're writing two versions of the sequel right now. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5072.38s)]
*  One that's continuing on with the characters from the first film. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5075.42s)]
*  And then another sequel idea, which is a whole bunch of different characters in a different [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5078.22s)]
*  country. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5081.66s)]
*  I don't want to spoil it, but I love the end of it. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5082.66s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5084.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5085.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5086.7s)]
*  Full circle. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5087.7s)]
*  It's that thing that when you're drafting and redrafting and you're always figuring [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5088.7s)]
*  things out and you can strengthen things and you really follow an idea or a theme and you [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5091.46s)]
*  just find things like that ending. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5095.78s)]
*  Yeah, and you punch them all through the script. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5097.139999999999s)]
*  That's a cool thing. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5098.82s)]
*  Like movies that are layered like that and work on different levels. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5099.82s)]
*  That's the stuff that we liked watching. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5103.82s)]
*  So when you get to that point in the script where you can really thread theme and stuff [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5105.5s)]
*  and subtext throughout the script, it just makes it feel so much more complete. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5109.259999999999s)]
*  Normally when we write our poor co-writer, we'll just write like 50, 60 pages of scenes, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5113.139999999999s)]
*  moments, you know, characters, things like that, interactions. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5118.86s)]
*  And there's no, we're not thinking of, oh, this is the midpoint. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5122.74s)]
*  This is the characters, this point in the story, like a film structure. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5125.9s)]
*  It's just like a world and characters and things like that. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5130.58s)]
*  And then like a basic kind of outline. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5134.339999999999s)]
*  And then our poor co-writer is like, okay, I've got to try and fit this into like film [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5136.26s)]
*  structure now and like this means this and like kind of navigate the mess. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5140.26s)]
*  And always try and attribute different things with, so exploring things that really bother [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5144.9800000000005s)]
*  you or like I remember when my grandfather passed away, it was Christmas Day, and my [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5149.900000000001s)]
*  dad was trying to give him CPR and his vomit was stuck in his beard. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5154.26s)]
*  Like my dad was giving my grandfather CPR and my grandfather's vomit was stuck in his [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5159.46s)]
*  beard. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5162.7s)]
*  I remember that was sticking in my mind, the vomit in his beard. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5163.7s)]
*  Even that's in the scene where the dad pulls out the mom who's overdosed and is trying [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5166.66s)]
*  to give her CPR. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5172.099999999999s)]
*  So it's just like tapping into small things like that. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5173.099999999999s)]
*  Anything that bothers you, just try and express it in a way or put it in there. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5175.099999999999s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5178.7s)]
*  You know, that's part of the writing process. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5179.9s)]
*  The whole process of filming it and then editing it and then seeing a final draft, like what [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5181.94s)]
*  was that like when you watched the thing for the first time all the way through? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5188.3s)]
*  I remember, because we were editing while we were on set, we have to bump out of a location [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5192.7s)]
*  in three days. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5197.22s)]
*  So we shoot all day, we go home and edit all night. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5198.22s)]
*  We go back to set, shoot all day, then we go home and edit all night. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5200.3s)]
*  No sleep. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5202.5s)]
*  A couple of three days in there. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5203.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5204.5s)]
*  Three days sleep. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5205.5s)]
*  You should have had the fucking smelling salts for that. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5206.5s)]
*  Because it's sort of like, it's so engaging and stimulating. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5208.7s)]
*  You have to make sure that you've got every single shot that you could possibly want because [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5211.74s)]
*  we know we don't have the budget to come back here. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5214.7s)]
*  As soon as we wrap this location, we're done. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5216.74s)]
*  That's the only shots we're ever going to get for this film forever. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5218.9s)]
*  So that was like a thing. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5221.58s)]
*  I remember when I edited together some of the sequences, that first possession, I just [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5223.66s)]
*  started crying because I was like, fuck. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5227.74s)]
*  So shit. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5229.7s)]
*  I started crying because I can't believe what came out of this. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5230.7s)]
*  And it's everyone, our cinematographer, Aaron McCloskey, our production designer, Bethany [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5235.42s)]
*  Ryan, our producer, Samantha Jennings, the performances of everyone. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5239.74s)]
*  It's all those crafts and all those masters putting all their energies into this one thing [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5242.94s)]
*  that makes it more heightened or more incredible than you could ever have imagined. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5247.58s)]
*  Even our sound designer, Emma Bording-Young, as soon as you start doing passes and you [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5251.9400000000005s)]
*  see things getting stronger of every single part, I don't know, it's the most rewarding [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5255.62s)]
*  thing. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5259.62s)]
*  The first time though, I feel bad for our editor, when it came time to edit the movie, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5260.62s)]
*  I had an edit of the whole movie, Danny had an edit, and the editor had an edit. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5264.14s)]
*  And then he's like, let's just watch mine and give me broad strokes. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5268.42s)]
*  We started watching in like two minutes. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5270.9800000000005s)]
*  We were like, oh, we've got to do it scene by scene. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5272.9s)]
*  And then like kind of look at all three cuts and kind of do it like that. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5276.74s)]
*  So it was like a big process of like looking at what works best for the overall story. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5279.34s)]
*  I think it's an annoying process because people don't usually work like that. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5284.7s)]
*  It's a unique way to work. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5287.62s)]
*  But because we've been doing so hands on with the YouTube stuff, well, luckily they were [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5288.62s)]
*  accommodating all those heads of departments were down. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5292.34s)]
*  Yeah, like to do that. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5294.34s)]
*  But we were really involved. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5295.34s)]
*  Is it difficult when you're so close to something and then you watch it to see it the way an [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5296.82s)]
*  outside person would see it because you just you're aware of every detail and how it was [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5302.62s)]
*  made and is it difficult to like have an objective perception of what the film is like? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5307.62s)]
*  I say that when we finished it and I'll say this is really good, we'd bring in someone [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5314.3s)]
*  to watch it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5318.82s)]
*  So when we're at the editor, Jeff Lamb's house, his studio is underneath his house. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5319.82s)]
*  So we brought his son in to just watch it with us. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5324.3s)]
*  And you could feel when things are sagging and not working and you need that outside [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5326.62s)]
*  perspective when you're not attached to it. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5330.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5332.42s)]
*  And you can kind of see it in the body language that they're kind of like, it's getting fucking [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5333.42s)]
*  boring now or something like that. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5336.3s)]
*  You can just feel the energy of the room. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5337.58s)]
*  Another thing you can do is separating yourself from it, taking a bit of a break from it and [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5339.5s)]
*  coming back to it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5343.86s)]
*  It's a good thing as well. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5344.86s)]
*  That's good for writing too. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5345.86s)]
*  Also having like a group. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5346.86s)]
*  Films do it a lot. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5350.78s)]
*  We only did it once where we had like a bunch of different people come in from like all [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5351.78s)]
*  different age ranges and like, you know, real old people like uncles, a teacher, younger, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5356.18s)]
*  like teenagers, and they all come and watch the movie and then like ask, did it all make [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5361.38s)]
*  sense? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5365.34s)]
*  Is there stuff that felt like it didn't make sense? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5366.34s)]
*  Didn't click with you? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5368.860000000001s)]
*  Does that part get sagged or got boring? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5369.860000000001s)]
*  And you kind of get different input. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5372.3s)]
*  And if a lot of people are saying the same thing, then you kind of go, you know, oh, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5373.820000000001s)]
*  maybe there's something here. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5378.5s)]
*  Maybe that isn't clicking right now. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5379.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5380.9400000000005s)]
*  But every time we put it together, I was more like it just turned out so much better than [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5382.099999999999s)]
*  you could have imagined. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5386.86s)]
*  So like that, I can't imagine the opposite experience when you're like turning it together [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5387.86s)]
*  and it ends up being really bad. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5390.94s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5391.94s)]
*  Well, there was, yeah, we had a, there was a difficult process with the music was really [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5392.94s)]
*  difficult. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5396.78s)]
*  That was the most stressful. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5397.78s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5398.78s)]
*  The movie. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5399.78s)]
*  This is more your fault than anyone's fault. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5400.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5404.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5405.299999999999s)]
*  Because Michael's very specific. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5406.299999999999s)]
*  Michael's so specific with music that he edits it to a really specific temp score. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5408.3s)]
*  And so I listened to like hundreds of songs and then like put a temp score together and [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5414.7s)]
*  gave it to the composer and said, amazing composer. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5418.7s)]
*  But I was like, this is exactly the vibe of the film. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5421.18s)]
*  And this is music that we can use or we can license it. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5424.9800000000005s)]
*  And then he's like, I'll stick close to the temp. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5427.78s)]
*  And there was no communication after that until a week before or two weeks before the [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5430.46s)]
*  score was supposed to be delivered. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5435.26s)]
*  And then I went and saw him and it was, he'd recorded the whole soundtrack, but it was [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5437.9800000000005s)]
*  very different from our, you know, version. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5443.46s)]
*  And it was just a different movie. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5447.38s)]
*  And then we had to like, oh, fuck, like we have to kind of start again. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5450.26s)]
*  I feel bad because you recorded all organically, like all these things. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5454.38s)]
*  He's really talented, but it was kind of in a direction that was not what the, our idea [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5457.54s)]
*  of what the film was. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5462.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5463.54s)]
*  We had fixed it in time. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5464.94s)]
*  We couldn't in time before it was supposed to be delivered. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5465.94s)]
*  And then we went back to mix the movie. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5468.82s)]
*  And then I was with, you know, I was with music editor after mixing days. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5471.22s)]
*  We'd stay up all night trying to do the music and like kind of figure out a way around the [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5474.78s)]
*  music to make the music work. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5478.62s)]
*  And then when we watched it back, it just was a different movie. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5480.3s)]
*  And I remember Sam saying, it feels like a different movie. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5483.66s)]
*  It doesn't feel like I can get inside the movie now. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5486.34s)]
*  There's something wrong here. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5489.14s)]
*  And it's kind of that thing of like, you don't know understanding why it was, but I knew [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5490.5s)]
*  what I wanted and it just wasn't coming across. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5494.02s)]
*  So then, and that's what I broke down crying because I was like, oh, it's over. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5496.26s)]
*  Like it's over. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5499.740000000001s)]
*  And that we had the tickets for the premiere just gone on sale. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5500.860000000001s)]
*  This is before Sundance. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5504.1s)]
*  We did a premiere in Adelaide. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5505.1s)]
*  The tickets going on sale. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5507.900000000001s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5508.900000000001s)]
*  I'm like, we have no music. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5509.780000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not going to the fucking premiere for the music shit. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5510.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but then luckily, Sam, our producer. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5513.740000000001s)]
*  Fuck. Oh, we love you, Sam. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5516.9800000000005s)]
*  She's like, let's get a new composer and let's let's do this properly. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5518.900000000001s)]
*  We didn't get this far to fuck it up right at the end. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5522.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So we got a new composer that I worked with and we [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5524.18s)]
*  made this thing come together. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5528.700000000001s)]
*  Cornell. Yeah. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5530.62s)]
*  And he fucking saved the film. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5531.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's amazing. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5533.06s)]
*  And like I would give man, I feel bad for him. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5534.22s)]
*  I'd give fucking pages and he just fucking everything. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5535.700000000001s)]
*  He's so amazing. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5538.3s)]
*  He's like OCD with certain with music and sound. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5539.14s)]
*  I don't even understand like like a note of here. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5542.22s)]
*  I know I'm like lower is I got a D or an E key. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5545.5s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. Just lower. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5548.38s)]
*  Do do do that one. That one. That one. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5549.66s)]
*  And then like like it's like a feeling of music as opposed to [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5551.86s)]
*  I don't understand technically what it is. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5556.58s)]
*  But learning to communicate was a new thing, because even when Emma would send [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5559.94s)]
*  in stuff, Mark would be like, no, like his emails seemed rude [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5564.46s)]
*  when he was responding to her. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5568.0599999999995s)]
*  And it was like, Michael, don't send messages like that. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5569.62s)]
*  Like you would do it, too. Oh, yeah, maybe. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5571.86s)]
*  But it's just like learning to communicate in a way where like [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5573.78s)]
*  we have not worked with this person before. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5578.66s)]
*  We don't know how our tone is coming across. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5580.1s)]
*  It's a collaborative effort. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5582.46s)]
*  It's such a yeah. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5583.740000000001s)]
*  And it's such a yeah, it is. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5584.700000000001s)]
*  It's a collaborative effort. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5585.740000000001s)]
*  And that's why movies can kind of I feel not come together completely [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5586.700000000001s)]
*  if there's all these amazing creatives, but they're going in different directions. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5591.58s)]
*  So it's like kind of like having it all go to one direction. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5595.820000000001s)]
*  That's like when everything's working in sync as opposed to against each other. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5598.860000000001s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5603.38s)]
*  And I think that with music going forward, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5604.26s)]
*  I want to get music started getting composed in pre-production [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5606.94s)]
*  and like finding the sound early as opposed to just waiting at the end. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5610.82s)]
*  Why not have a part of pre-production like everything else is? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5614.18s)]
*  Makeup gets time and like the schedule does. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5617.14s)]
*  Why not the music as well? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5619.7s)]
*  Like because that's such an integral part. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5620.94s)]
*  Sound in film is massive and people don't understand. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5622.78s)]
*  Like even it brings so much more than you would realize. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5626.46s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5630.26s)]
*  And it's like finding those heads of departments like Emma and Cornell, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5631.5s)]
*  people that are achieving things that you could never possibly achieve. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5635.26s)]
*  And Jeff, our editor, went like we can't accomplish this by ourselves. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5638.46s)]
*  Someone that we can really look up to and rely on. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5641.9800000000005s)]
*  Is it better than us? Yeah, it does better than us. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5643.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So it's so fun finding those heads of departments and building. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5645.5s)]
*  It's like you guys are so specific with your visions. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5649.02s)]
*  It's so important that you maintain creative control. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5651.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5654.42s)]
*  That's what I say. Yeah. Have room. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5655.3s)]
*  Budgets get bigger and studios get larger. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5656.820000000001s)]
*  And then the consequences or at least the risk is higher for them. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5660.22s)]
*  They're going to want to have more control. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5664.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's the thing is, sometimes these movies. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5665.78s)]
*  They want to have a creative director, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5669.58s)]
*  but they have to protect their investment. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5672.5s)]
*  And the way to protect your investment is to do what's worked in the past. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5674.38s)]
*  So then it turns instead of being like a new thing, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5677.58s)]
*  it kind of turns into what has worked in the past. Right. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5680.179999999999s)]
*  And then like so. But, you know, I feel really grateful. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5683.5s)]
*  Eight twenty four is we don't have to worry about that [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5686.62s)]
*  because eight twenty four moving forward like this. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5690.46s)]
*  So they're like a family like they they don't feel like Hollywood execs [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5692.86s)]
*  or something like that, where they're like just like thinking about money [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5697.099999999999s)]
*  and capitalizing on money. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5700.339999999999s)]
*  They're all about the director and directors vision. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5701.94s)]
*  So they will give creative cut that creative final cut to us. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5704.099999999999s)]
*  And like, say they certainly should now after that. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5708.139999999999s)]
*  You guys know what you're doing. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5712.66s)]
*  It's it's really good. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5714.5s)]
*  But until the next movie comes out and it's shit. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5716.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they should probably. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5718.179999999999s)]
*  That does happen occasionally, like M. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5719.339999999999s)]
*  Night Shyamalan, like he has that amazing movie in Sixth Sense. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5721.74s)]
*  And then the movies after that are just like, oh, I was pretty decent. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5726.219999999999s)]
*  I like Split. I like Unbreakable. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5731.42s)]
*  I didn't see Sprit. Oh, it was OK. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5733.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the Sixth Sense was so good. So incredible. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5735.26s)]
*  It's so hard sometimes when your best one is your first one. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5738.98s)]
*  Well, you know, nothing after that. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5742.0199999999995s)]
*  And then like there was the one with Marky Mark where the plants [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5743.42s)]
*  were killing people like, OK. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5745.62s)]
*  You know what happens sometimes? You get. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5748.58s)]
*  You know, the fuck am I watching? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5751.74s)]
*  The fuck is this? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5753.9s)]
*  Yeah, is that the one? I haven't seen it. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5755.34s)]
*  That's the happening. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5757.38s)]
*  Is that the happening? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5758.3s)]
*  No, that was the other one. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5759.26s)]
*  Which one was the happening? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5761.66s)]
*  The one where they all kill themselves. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5762.7s)]
*  They're trying to kill themselves. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5764.34s)]
*  Don't know. They start walking back. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5767.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's happening. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5768.219999999999s)]
*  That's the happening when they start killing themselves. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5769.139999999999s)]
*  Right. There's like an epidemic. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5771.179999999999s)]
*  Are you sure about that? Am I making shit up? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5772.7s)]
*  Am I drunk? That whatever the fuck that thing was, I don't know. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5774.46s)]
*  I'm making movies up my head. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5776.62s)]
*  Is that happening? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5778.26s)]
*  You know what happens also? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5780.26s)]
*  Like, it's weird. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5781.98s)]
*  You come after the movie comes out, you get the opportunity [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5783.18s)]
*  to do whatever you want next. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5785.94s)]
*  What do you want to do next? Like, we'll do it. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5787.66s)]
*  Like, that's the kind of position we're in now. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5789.26s)]
*  I could see people rushing into things like half-baked ideas [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5792.14s)]
*  or something too early because you're thinking about money [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5795.98s)]
*  and capitalizing on this moment. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5799.3s)]
*  And then the second one being not as you know, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5801.14s)]
*  because the first one's like, that's everything. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5803.54s)]
*  Everything's riding on this movie has to be the best fucking thing ever. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5805.18s)]
*  Then when you do one, like the second one or the third one, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5808.38s)]
*  where you haven't had that time to develop the script, you know, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5810.660000000001s)]
*  and you kind of rush into the half-baked idea. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5814.22s)]
*  Well, as you know, we've been writing for three years, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5816.5s)]
*  and I'm so excited to fucking start filming again. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5819.14s)]
*  That's what we want to do. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5821.22s)]
*  And then we've been doing the doco as well, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5822.54s)]
*  which we showed you a little bit of. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5824.42s)]
*  Yeah, you were telling me about this death wrestling. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5825.42s)]
*  What is it called? Deathmatch Wrestling. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5827.9400000000005s)]
*  Deathmatch Wrestling. So we're doing that with A24 at the moment. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5829.58s)]
*  This is in Japan that they do this? Where is this? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5832.1s)]
*  Oh, and in America as well. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5834.58s)]
*  It's worldwide. It's like a very niche. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5836.14s)]
*  It's pretty, I guess, controversial in a way. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5838.780000000001s)]
*  A lot of people don't like it. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5841.620000000001s)]
*  Well, they were throwing people on the barbed wire. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5842.700000000001s)]
*  Show the video. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5844.38s)]
*  Yeah. The other video. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5845.620000000001s)]
*  I can't show that one because it's the part of the documentary. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5847.18s)]
*  But if you write Sick Nick, what do you write? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5850.9800000000005s)]
*  CCW, ultraviolence at its best. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5853.42s)]
*  That'll be that's a good compilation. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5857.780000000001s)]
*  These guys are covered with scars, like legitimate scars. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5859.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's the most extreme form of wrestling. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5862.660000000001s)]
*  And it's the most dangerous. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5865.78s)]
*  And it's the least paid and the like the least viewed because it's so graphic. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5867.02s)]
*  It has a very niche audience and they brutalise themselves. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5871.14s)]
*  Legitimately. Yeah. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5875.900000000001s)]
*  And like, so when you look at wrestling, wrestling is already like a risky sport. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5877.22s)]
*  These guys are doing like week in, week out for like 100 bucks [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5881.02s)]
*  getting fucking annihilated. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5884.5s)]
*  And like it's a fascinating world. So fascinating. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5886.7s)]
*  I'm so drawn to it and I love it so much. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5891.18s)]
*  Even as a kid, that was always drawn to that really extreme side of wrestling. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5892.82s)]
*  There was Cactus Jack McFauley, who undertook a throw off the top of the cell. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5896.82s)]
*  And he used to wrestle in Japan in death match in a company called IWA. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5900.34s)]
*  And that was my first time seeing a death match tournament [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5905.099999999999s)]
*  where he was wrestling Terry Franco exploding barbed wire, exploding ropes. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5907.9s)]
*  They're bleeding everywhere. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5911.74s)]
*  And it's such commitment. It's such extreme performance art. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5913.099999999999s)]
*  I'm so drawn to it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5916.219999999999s)]
*  Imagine you're watching John Wick and, you know, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5917.5s)]
*  Keanu Reeves is going to get kicked downstairs, but you're there in person [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5922.0599999999995s)]
*  and he's doing the stunt live and you don't know if he's going to be OK or not. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5926.34s)]
*  Like that that kind of energy in the room. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5930.0599999999995s)]
*  And then also people you have this kind of like it's kind of like when you watch [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5933.54s)]
*  like the UFC, like these two guys are the best like clashing. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5937.74s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5940.46s)]
*  That kind of that intensity, right? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5941.46s)]
*  That vibe in like UFC or before at fights. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5943.82s)]
*  It's like that. But they're like taking these crazy risks [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5947.34s)]
*  where they could get paralyzed. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5950.38s)]
*  They could cut like, you know, arteries. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5952.02s)]
*  One guy, Nick Gage, died and got brought back to life in a helicopter. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5955.06s)]
*  Like they had he cut an artery from a light bulb. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5959.66s)]
*  She's and we we we did some events as well, like on the YouTube. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5963.06s)]
*  I did because we used to do all kids back death match wrestling as like teenagers. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5967.3s)]
*  And we did a video for our YouTube. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5973.06s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, I'm just kids. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5975.06s)]
*  And then fans are called to that again. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5977.46s)]
*  We want to see you guys do that now. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5979.14s)]
*  So we organized some free events where we got everyone to come for free [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5980.58s)]
*  to watch us wrestle. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5984.26s)]
*  And they thought it was a gimmick thing. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5985.18s)]
*  And then we went fucking hard. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5986.5s)]
*  And once this this light bulb smashed off, I got slammed into it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5988.42s)]
*  It was 70 light tubes taped together and I got smashed into it. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5992.58s)]
*  And one of them broke off wrong and went up into my ribs. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5995.900000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I was like, and I hadn't felt anything before that [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=5998.5s)]
*  because of the adrenaline, the barbed wire, didn't feel thumbtacks. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6001.780000000001s)]
*  I didn't feel I really felt that. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6004.740000000001s)]
*  So I was like, I was on something here. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6006.06s)]
*  But let's continue the match. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6008.38s)]
*  And then I was like getting bloodier. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6009.5s)]
*  And then I laid on a table and a guy went on the balcony, jumped onto the table. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6011.02s)]
*  Is this from one of them? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6015.38s)]
*  Oh, potentially, this looks like I don't know. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6016.900000000001s)]
*  But yeah, that's if you write CZW. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6020.3s)]
*  I see that actually. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6023.14s)]
*  Play this. Yeah, play that. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6024.82s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, he missed. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6027.9800000000005s)]
*  He missed. Yeah, that's like a that's like a wrestling. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6029.42s)]
*  I'll show Jamie this one. I miss Mr. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6032.74s)]
*  One. But wait, if you got that guy, you got to get fucked up [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6034.54s)]
*  from that. Well, there's there's a thing about it. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6038.1s)]
*  There's like a there's a camaraderie about it as well, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6040.9800000000005s)]
*  because your life's in their hands, their lives in your hands. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6044.02s)]
*  It has to be this ultimate trust. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6046.58s)]
*  If you aren't committed together to like pull these moves off, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6047.9400000000005s)]
*  then you're going to hurt each other bad. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6051.740000000001s)]
*  Well, this is not that that's just a guy missing. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6053.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is so and skip to a bit further in probably like 30 seconds in. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6055.9800000000005s)]

*  Yeah, so dangerous. It's so exciting. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6071.58s)]
*  So it's looked down upon because they're like there's no technique. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6073.299999999999s)]
*  It's just guys smashing each other. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6077.339999999999s)]
*  Like that's why people don't like it. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6078.86s)]
*  But to me, it is technique. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6080.86s)]
*  I feel like there is. Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6083.099999999999s)]
*  And especially now, like it's not just because they're like, if you. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6084.299999999999s)]
*  Good Lord. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6090.62s)]

*  It depends on it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6098.58s)]
*  It can be bad. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6099.219999999999s)]

*  There's a high def, they're defying death. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6134.62s)]
*  But they also there's like a respect from the fans as well. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6136.46s)]
*  Like you're putting your body on the line like that extreme for our entertainment. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6138.860000000001s)]
*  When it's like it's like 300 people in the venue. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6142.26s)]
*  And these guys are like risking everything to entertain. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6144.78s)]
*  That's something that's like there's a respect that comes of that. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6148.9800000000005s)]

*  I think it's like go Ronald WWE beat down. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6156.58s)]
*  This is this is which one this one is a fucking weed whacker. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6159.259999999999s)]

*  Let me just show you this thing that happened to me when we were doing ours. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6172.5s)]
*  I was dressed as Ronald McDonald, one of our characters on YouTube. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6175.259999999999s)]
*  And when I got the thing up my ribs [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6178.98s)]
*  and then I got put on this table and the guy jumped and I felt all the pressure [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6182.259999999999s)]
*  like flesh. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6186.139999999999s)]
*  So they're really bad job at. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6187.299999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, that's a different one. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6188.82s)]
*  Not this video. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6190.66s)]
*  No, no. I write Ronald WWE beat down. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6191.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Ronald WWE. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6193.82s)]
*  Right into the search. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6195.58s)]
*  Yeah, that first one, that first one and just go like halfway through. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6201.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, a bit further. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6207.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6209.860000000001s)]
*  That's the you're making us look stupid and crazy. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6210.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is this one side. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6212.660000000001s)]
*  When we have the stunt guys, I purposely tell not to come to this stuff [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6214.14s)]
*  because this isn't like normal stunt performing. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6216.9400000000005s)]
*  You just get hit over the head by a neon light bulb. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6220.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So that's OK. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6223.42s)]
*  That's the one. Yeah. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6224.860000000001s)]
*  This is one that went up into my room. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6226.54s)]
*  Oh, God, dude. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6228.660000000001s)]
*  And keep going for another minute and you'll see like when they put me on the [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6230.38s)]
*  you'll see like when they put me on the table. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6233.18s)]
*  When you go back, it's one, yeah, that's the jump there. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6246.34s)]
*  And I just felt all the fucking blood. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6249.46s)]
*  They just blurt out the side of my back. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6251.46s)]

*  Oh, my God, do you get paralyzed [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6260.660000000001s)]
*  from something like that. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6262.5s)]
*  I don't know what it is that draws us to it, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6264.3s)]
*  but we're sort of doing the documentary [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6266.14s)]
*  to explore the psychology behind the need to do it [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6267.58s)]
*  or why they do it and talking to the wrestlers [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6271.34s)]
*  and finding out what's going on with them [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6273.06s)]
*  and why they're drawn to it and why we were drawn to it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6275.66s)]
*  It's so interesting to me because I know it's disgusting. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6278.02s)]
*  I know it's weird and I want to figure out [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6280.1s)]
*  why the psychology behind it. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6282.7s)]
*  Yeah, why people would do it. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6284.14s)]
*  Why do you think people would do it, Joe? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6286.5s)]
*  Because they're dumb. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6288.54s)]
*  Or? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6289.74s)]
*  Dumb. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6291.38s)]
*  Deeper? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6292.58s)]
*  Or dumb. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6293.22s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6294.02s)]
*  You don't think that's... [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6295.66s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6296.66s)]
*  We're going to figure out... [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6298.860000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's all just dumb. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6299.7s)]
*  No? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6300.860000000001s)]
*  What else is it? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6302.06s)]
*  It's a way to feel present, I feel. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6303.14s)]
*  Do you think there's a smarter way to do that? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6307.58s)]
*  There probably is, but there's... [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6310.42s)]
*  But once you experience something like that, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6311.860000000001s)]
*  going back to normal life, you couldn't. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6314.78s)]
*  Really? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6316.9800000000005s)]
*  You couldn't. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6317.66s)]
*  I bet you could. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6318.18s)]
*  The closer you get to death, the more alive you feel, Joe. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6318.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6321.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6322.46s)]
*  We're going to do it right now, death match. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6323.26s)]
*  But it's the same thing. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6325.42s)]
*  I guess it's different with martial arts. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6327.58s)]
*  But when people look at it at base value, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6330.54s)]
*  they're just cockfighting or people are just going to... [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6332.7s)]
*  But it's so much deeper than that, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6335.38s)]
*  martial arts and things like that. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6337.18s)]
*  Sure. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6338.54s)]
*  People would see it as... [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6338.98s)]
*  People would say UFC like they see a street fight. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6340.22s)]
*  It's not that. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6343.94s)]
*  I remember I could watch death match wrestling as a kid [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6344.98s)]
*  and always loved it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6348.26s)]
*  And then I would shake when watching UFC. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6349.34s)]
*  I would physically shake. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6351.9800000000005s)]
*  I couldn't believe that they're actually trying to hurt each other. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6353.02s)]
*  As a young kid, it really... [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6356.3s)]
*  UFC used to freak me out. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6357.900000000001s)]
*  I remember when I played UFC 1, the game on Xbox, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6359.06s)]
*  I was fucking shaking when they were hitting a thing. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6361.34s)]
*  Yeah, something about fighting and that really one-on-one violence. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6364.54s)]
*  I found that so much more... [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6368.7s)]
*  You're trying to pussy. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6369.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6370.46s)]
*  So, no, maybe that's where we're getting into it. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6370.74s)]
*  So you like this performative violence. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6372.22s)]
*  Yes, performative violence. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6374.54s)]
*  Yeah, there was something about knowing that. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6375.900000000001s)]
*  Because it is actual violence. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6377.22s)]
*  There's actual cutting and bleeding, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6378.62s)]
*  but there's something about it being agreed upon. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6380.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6382.7s)]
*  And that it's... [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6383.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's performance art. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6384.46s)]
*  It's kind of like... [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6385.5s)]
*  Yeah, like UFC is like, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6386.0199999999995s)]
*  use the best of the world and let's see who's better. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6387.14s)]
*  You're not trying to get hurt. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6388.94s)]
*  Whereas this is like... [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6390.62s)]
*  But you're not trying... [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6391.62s)]
*  It's safely doing it. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6392.46s)]
*  No, the wrestling is like, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6393.74s)]
*  how do we create this spectacle [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6394.82s)]
*  as safely as possible in that environment [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6397.7s)]
*  and be okay, I guess, and tell a story. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6401.099999999999s)]
*  We're doing it a bad way of verbalizing it. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6402.3s)]
*  The documentary will do it better. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6404.34s)]
*  We're trying to explore it. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6405.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing is we're trying to find out these questions. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6406.22s)]
*  Like what draws people to it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6407.94s)]
*  And what is the other film that you're writing? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6409.139999999999s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of stuff. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6411.339999999999s)]
*  We're writing three films right now. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6412.339999999999s)]
*  And it's just in constant circulation. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6414.66s)]
*  Whenever we hit like a roadblock or one, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6416.0599999999995s)]
*  it'll sort of jump onto the next one. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6417.86s)]
*  So we're developing the Talk to Me sequel. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6419.419999999999s)]
*  And we've got another project of A24. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6421.62s)]
*  We're talking about Street Fighter right now as well [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6423.7s)]
*  with Capcom and Legendary. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6426.0599999999995s)]
*  And then, yeah, so it's just sort of developing a bunch of stuff [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6428.78s)]
*  and working on a bunch of stuff. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6431.339999999999s)]
*  It's finding time, like delegating time is the thing now. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6432.299999999999s)]
*  Although, because I guess with the ADHD, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6435.66s)]
*  you're like, listen up. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6438.66s)]
*  And then you start going to rabbit holes of each script. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6440.3s)]
*  And then I can't help but explore St. Avenue. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6443.179999999999s)]
*  There was a script that was sort of due two months ago. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6445.139999999999s)]
*  And I was like, it's going to be done. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6448.78s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, what if we change this ending a little bit? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6450.139999999999s)]
*  By changing the ending, we change the midpoint. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6452.86s)]
*  By changing the midpoint, we've changed the start. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6455.139999999999s)]
*  And you're basically rewriting the entire thing. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6457.099999999999s)]
*  But I need to follow that thread through and see if that's a more [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6459.099999999999s)]
*  exciting way to tell the story. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6461.26s)]
*  And yeah, so we're a little behind on things. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6462.94s)]
*  But we're getting there. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6465.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're trying to figure out. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6467.06s)]
*  We want to shoot early next year. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6468.18s)]
*  And I need to figure out sleep as well. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6470.42s)]
*  I have a big sleep issue as well. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6472.18s)]
*  I've had it my whole life, like not being able to fall asleep. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6475.66s)]
*  And then when I fall asleep, I wake up every 90 minutes or something [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6481.1s)]
*  like that. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6484.9400000000005s)]
*  What's your diagnosis? [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6485.42s)]
*  There's different people that say different things. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6486.66s)]
*  I did sleep studies overnight, then a full 24-hour day one. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6488.7s)]
*  They said idiopathic hypersomnia. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6492.3s)]
*  Someone said narcolepsy. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6494.66s)]
*  But it's more, it's falling. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6496.98s)]
*  I guess I've tried meditating and looking at bloods and exercise. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6499.9s)]
*  It's falling asleep. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6503.5s)]
*  Meditating before sleep, trying everything to try and what is it. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6506.22s)]
*  But I can't fall asleep. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6510.34s)]
*  And then when I do finally fall asleep, even if I'm exhausted, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6513.0599999999995s)]
*  I stay up two, three days straight, I still wake up after 90 minutes. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6516.0599999999995s)]
*  So is it just your mind is racing all the time? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6520.86s)]
*  Your mind wakes you up? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6524.06s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6525.660000000001s)]
*  It seems you guys are very hyper. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6526.34s)]
*  You got a lot going on in your heads. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6528.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and I guess that's a thing. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6530.860000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, my sleeping pattern is just. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6534.14s)]
*  Because you're the same, but you don't have it like I have. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6536.22s)]
*  Yeah, my sleeping pattern is just weird. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6538.3s)]
*  I run off naps. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6539.860000000001s)]
*  I'll sleep for two hours, then I'm like, I'm up now for four hours. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6540.620000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I'm tired. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6542.9800000000005s)]
*  I have one hour. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6543.620000000001s)]
*  Then I'm like, oh, I'm up for 12 hours. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6544.26s)]
*  All right, I'll sleep for three hours. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6545.660000000001s)]
*  It's just sort of, there's no set time to go to sleep and wake up. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6546.860000000001s)]
*  It's sort of just random. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6549.540000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's a genetic thing with you guys. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6550.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think our parents are like that. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6553.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a twins. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6555.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6558.38s)]
*  And maybe it is just genetic with you. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6558.86s)]
*  Like you whatever that gene is, you both got it. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6561.22s)]
*  But how come he's dumber than me? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6563.54s)]
*  Come on now. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6568.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6569.02s)]
*  Matt, come on, man. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6570.1s)]
*  You've embarrassed me in front of Joe. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6570.9s)]
*  Hey, man, what are you doing? [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6572.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6573.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6574.78s)]
*  But it's the energy that you guys have that leads you to be so productive, too, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6575.38s)]
*  I'd imagine. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6578.26s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6579.38s)]
*  Sort of manic energy that you have. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6580.26s)]
*  That's right. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6582.46s)]
*  I know. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6582.9800000000005s)]
*  It's literally, man, if I could just switch it off at the end of the day, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6583.5s)]
*  would be awesome. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6588.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6589.3s)]
*  But then you wouldn't have it on all the time. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6589.66s)]
*  I think exactly. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6591.34s)]
*  There's a gift you get. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6592.9s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard of Zyrum. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6594.78s)]
*  Zyrum. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6596.22s)]
*  What is that? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6596.94s)]
*  That's a medication for narcolepsy that knocks you out. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6597.58s)]
*  It's the only medication that apparently puts you through the stages of sleep. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6600.86s)]
*  But it's a medication. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6605.78s)]
*  So it knocks you out. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6606.9s)]
*  But it has all these side effects. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6608.54s)]
*  It's G.H.B. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6609.58s)]
*  It's like people use it. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6610.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6611.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6612.54s)]
*  Party drug. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6612.9s)]
*  It's a party drug. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6613.7s)]
*  So what is the side effects? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6614.42s)]
*  Well, the first page says suicide attempts. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6616.58s)]
*  And then also, the sleep doctor I was speaking to is like, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6619.78s)]
*  there's two, it's like people are debating, they actually don't know whether it's [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6623.18s)]
*  people that are in bad places, don't have the energy to take their own lives. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6628.5s)]
*  But being on Zyrum gives you the energy to do it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6633.06s)]
*  Or is the Zyrum changing your mind to think more like that, more radical or something like that? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6635.86s)]
*  Are you taking Zyrum? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6644.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm scared to take it. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6645.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to be addicted to a drug. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6646.7s)]
*  I don't want to be relying on that. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6650.54s)]
*  Just deal with whatever sleep you get. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6652.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6654.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6655.219999999999s)]
*  It's obviously working. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6656.099999999999s)]
*  As I'm getting older though now, I feel like it weighs on you a lot more. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6659.179999999999s)]

*  She wants to win so bad in that environment, you know. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6970.38s)]
*  How are you connected to the martial arts world? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6973.78s)]
*  You were saying that you train. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6976.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6978.38s)]
*  Physical stuff has always been like, you know, ever since little kid. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6980.02s)]
*  Like I love doing like the stunts and whatever as kids. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6983.3s)]
*  Then I did a bit of Muay Thai, just training. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6987.06s)]
*  And then we were part of the reason why Logan Paul fought KSI [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6989.74s)]
*  because we were friends with both of them. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6995.820000000001s)]
*  We're good friends with both of them. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6997.02s)]
*  Logan wasn't going to fight KSI. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=6998.74s)]
*  And then Danny went over and convinced him to do you have to. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7002.62s)]
*  It's going to be the biggest thing because I called him out. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7005.5s)]
*  Logan didn't want to do it. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7008.02s)]
*  It's like different audiences. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7009.06s)]
*  There's no fucking reason to do that. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7010.06s)]
*  And Danny went there, like kept hassling him and he's like, all right. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7012.1s)]
*  And then he agreed to fight him. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7014.740000000001s)]
*  So I fought on the undercard of that event. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7016.54s)]
*  And I did. I'm undefeated, guys. Want to know? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7020.02s)]
*  And also, we even sponsor a fighter named Tim Rogers, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7024.5s)]
*  who's champion right now in South Australia, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7027.860000000001s)]
*  which I think he could maybe crack into the UFC as well. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7029.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I just I'm obsessed with it. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7032.06s)]
*  It's just like a thing that we like, a thing that we love as well. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7033.860000000001s)]
*  Like I listen to Ariel Hawani every every day. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7036.18s)]
*  The fight news, everything I like. I love it. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7038.9400000000005s)]
*  I like obsessed with it. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7041.22s)]
*  And then so the fight, I remember my auntie saying, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7043.58s)]
*  you're too little to fight. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7047.1s)]
*  And I was like, this weight classes in and the fight thing. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7048.740000000001s)]
*  She's like, no. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7052.26s)]
*  When I was saying I was going to fight on the undercard. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7052.820000000001s)]
*  So I told the people, I want the tallest person [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7055.06s)]
*  to show my auntie that I could fight. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7059.02s)]
*  So so my opponent was six foot three. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7060.1s)]
*  And then the fight night. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7063.38s)]
*  God bless you, scarce. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7066.1s)]
*  He wasn't very good. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7066.9400000000005s)]
*  But the training camp where I had to fucking get my fucking head [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7068.26s)]
*  kicked in by six foot three guys every fucking twice a week. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7072.02s)]
*  That was like a hell. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7075.62s)]
*  Like and I went to I did, yeah, five months training at T.J. Smith. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7077.26s)]
*  Oh, no, don't don't watch it. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7081.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I'm bad. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7083.9400000000005s)]
*  I found a good spot where you had a number of times. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7085.02s)]
*  Oh, God. See. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7086.900000000001s)]
*  No, you know, I press you over this. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7091.14s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7093.02s)]
*  Hey, look, push the beginning. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7094.18s)]
*  I'm leading up to that was like just getting smashed by six foot three guys. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7098.02s)]
*  And I remember once the first guy, the first six foot dude that I sparred [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7105.26s)]
*  was 100 kilos. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7109.780000000001s)]
*  And I met my trainer, Chris, being like, all right, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7111.18s)]
*  you're going to do five three minute rounds. All right. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7113.34s)]
*  And then behind him, I just saw this guy just [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7115.62s)]
*  hitting the heavy bag. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7119.26s)]
*  And then Chris, like, you're just going to make sure you see that. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7121.54s)]
*  And then like the guy walked off, I just see this fucking dent [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7124.02s)]
*  in the middle of them in a heavy bag. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7126.54s)]
*  And I went there and he just fucked me up like three standing eight counts. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7128.62s)]
*  Then the second time we started, I started three times. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7133.1s)]
*  The second time was one standing eight count. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7135.5s)]
*  Why are you fighting 220 pound guys? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7138.5s)]
*  I don't know. I guess that was all the bodies that we could find. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7142.06s)]
*  It was like different. How much do you weigh? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7144.7s)]
*  Seventy five kilos. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7147.1s)]
*  What is that? 170. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7148.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7151.7s)]
*  Two point two times 75, about 160. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7152.42s)]
*  And I think he was 10 kilos heavier than me on the fight night. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7154.66s)]
*  That guy. It was just like when I was fighting with different kind of [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7157.62s)]
*  six foot guys, one of the couple of them was the 100 kilo plus dudes. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7160.98s)]
*  Wait, I saw the backtrack. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7165.58s)]
*  Bulk and Bear won that fight, right? Yes. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7166.78s)]
*  Yes. OK, good. It was just yeah. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7169.22s)]
*  152 they had you at. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7170.98s)]
*  We saw 152 for the fight and he was 174. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7172.78s)]
*  I don't know that. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7176.74s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, I was I don't know. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7177.5s)]
*  Look, he's not a good fighter. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7179.58s)]
*  But it's like something that I've. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7180.82s)]
*  But you just did it for the fun. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7182.94s)]
*  Yeah. And then like I wanted that that feeling of like going out to a fight. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7184.34s)]
*  Like how every time I watched it, I got envious like people coming out. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7188.06s)]
*  But I want to I want to know what that feels like to be like, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7192.26s)]
*  we're going to go and like put it all the line like a fight. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7195.02s)]
*  That's what I wanted to experience. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7198.1s)]
*  That rush of a coward. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7199.900000000001s)]
*  I love I love that physical rush. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7201.3s)]
*  I think that's the same thing with the death match wrestling. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7203.62s)]
*  It's like taking doing something risky, you know, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7205.5s)]
*  something that could go wrong or could go very right is very engaging. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7208.34s)]
*  And I feel bad like when we're doing the. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7213.3s)]
*  The movie and stuff, which is a lot of fun, but I'm like, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7215.94s)]
*  I want to jump off something now. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7217.86s)]
*  I want to get I need to do something physical and I need I don't know. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7219.22s)]

*  That stuff. But then the fighting stuff, my ego, I couldn't take it if I lost. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7226.34s)]
*  So I first I'm like, maybe. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7229.94s)]
*  I just got. Yeah. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7232.9s)]

*  I'm going to replay every frame over and over again. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7235.94s)]
*  He was like tormenting me that as a joke, like you're mucking around with him. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7238.22s)]
*  But seriously, I think I was like I trained in Cyprus for a month before the fight. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7242.38s)]
*  And then I was like, I didn't realize about how the climate change, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7247.9800000000005s)]

*  concrete gyms with no ventilation. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7265.7s)]
*  And then we get my ass kicked and they go, all right, go out and get some air, man. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7268.34s)]
*  And I'll go out and it's fucking worse outside than it is in the gym. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7272.34s)]
*  You know, I couldn't breathe, couldn't breathe air. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7275.18s)]
*  I say Michael is a bad fighter. Michael choked me out once. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7277.62s)]
*  He broke down my door. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7280.66s)]

*  Yeah, you're a good fighter, Michael. You should have another fight. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7288.34s)]
*  If they do want you to get fucked up. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7291.18s)]

*  I suppose, yeah, getting really emotional, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7332.219999999999s)]
*  seeing someone open up like that and be vulnerable like that. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7333.78s)]
*  That's that was a weird one. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7336.82s)]
*  When whenever someone takes a late minute fight like that last minute, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7338.58s)]
*  10 day fight, it's just I know that you will want to do it, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7342.179999999999s)]
*  but it's not the right thing to do at a championship level, you know, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7345.9s)]
*  and especially if you look like what happened with Volkonovsky. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7349.82s)]
*  He got KO'd in the first round and the first fight was so competitive. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7352.46s)]
*  And you got to wonder, like, would he have gotten KO'd if he had a full camp? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7356.179999999999s)]
*  Like, would the result have been different? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7359.38s)]
*  Would he have prepared differently? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7361.26s)]
*  100 percent. Right. More faith in his cardio. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7362.9400000000005s)]
*  Same thing with Kamaru Usman and Hamzat Shmaiev. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7365.3s)]
*  Same thing. Like you didn't trust his cardio. It's just. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7369.02s)]
*  He was dealing damage there, right? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7372.02s)]
*  Around two and he was like he was kind of getting a flow on it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7373.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I feel bad for Volkonovsky because he did block the kick, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7376.5s)]
*  but it was like a little too low. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7380.06s)]
*  He was getting kicked in the body a bunch of times. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7381.38s)]
*  I think he thought it was coming to the body and he kind of went like this [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7383.26s)]
*  and he got kicked in the head. Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7386.06s)]
*  But that's why I feel like he was like he just went above his guard. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7388.02s)]
*  And that was perfect. I mean, it was a perfect setup. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7390.9800000000005s)]
*  He threw a bunch of left kicks to the body and then threw that one to the head. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7392.9400000000005s)]
*  It was perfect. Yeah. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7396.18s)]
*  I just hope he can bounce back after that. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7398.3s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. He'll bounce back. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7400.580000000001s)]
*  I liked that he was open about that stuff and vulnerable about that stuff [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7402.02s)]
*  because it speaks to so many, so many people. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7404.580000000001s)]
*  Hearing that from him is so meaningful and impactful. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7407.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7410.780000000001s)]
*  He chose his character too, the way he accepted the loss. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7412.18s)]
*  Yeah. So it's such a. Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7414.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can't wait to see him get back in. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7417.179999999999s)]
*  But sometimes you get knocked out like that. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7418.58s)]
*  You really should take a bunch of time off. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7420.42s)]
*  He got really cracked. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7422.86s)]
*  I mean, if you watch the head kick, it was like a head kick right to the temple, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7424.0599999999995s)]
*  right to the side of the head. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7427.86s)]
*  It's like it's a bad place to get hit. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7428.9s)]
*  You get hit really hard. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7430.78s)]
*  Fuck. I want to wait a little time after that. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7432.62s)]
*  Yeah. As a thing, also, when we're talking about mental perception, about [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7435.339999999999s)]
*  if that happens, are you going in kind of like with that in the back of your mind now? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7439.9s)]
*  You're going to happen. Sure. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7444.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was the first time it happened to him in the UFC. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7445.66s)]
*  He only got it had stopped, been stopped once in his career ever. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7447.82s)]
*  And that was at welterweight. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7450.82s)]
*  So he was fighting someone who was 170 pounds. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7451.98s)]
*  And that was quite a long time ago, early, early in his career. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7454.46s)]
*  And he's been completely undefeated in the UFC. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7457.34s)]
*  And then there was the Makachev fight. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7460.139999999999s)]
*  So he loses that decision, very close decision. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7461.78s)]
*  He looks like a world beater. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7464.46s)]
*  And then he takes his fight with very short notice and not really prepared [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7465.58s)]
*  and gets knocked out. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7470.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's one of those things that's like there's a very high risk. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7471.38s)]
*  And the reward obviously is very high as well. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7475.219999999999s)]
*  If he beats Makachev, he becomes two division champion. But [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7477.98s)]
*  you really can't fight a guy like that without really going through a camp. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7482.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you can. You might get lucky. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7485.38s)]
*  It might might work out your way, but it might not. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7487.46s)]
*  Is it? It's going to be surely if he goes on another run, you get a crack at [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7490.179999999999s)]
*  boxers would never do that. That's what's interesting. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7495.139999999999s)]
*  Like if Terrence Crawford was supposed to fight Errol Spence [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7497.62s)]
*  and Errol Spence got injured 10 days out, they would just cancel the fight. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7499.9s)]
*  They would never have a completely different opponent step in with no camp [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7503.9s)]
*  on 10 days. It's very unique to the UFC. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7508.22s)]
*  And I don't know if I'm a fan of it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7510.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, really? Don't like the loss. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7512.5s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7514.06s)]
*  I mean, I love the fact that people take a chance, but I don't like it [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7515.3s)]
*  in terms of someone. I want someone to be fully prepared. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7518.5s)]
*  That's what I really like. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7521.74s)]
*  I like when someone goes through a full camp, fully prepared, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7523.58s)]
*  absolutely ready for this one opponent, because you're dealing with this [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7526.54s)]
*  insanely high risk sport that's very difficult to do. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7529.66s)]
*  And I just don't feel like with proper preparation, you can, you know, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7534.66s)]
*  he's probably at 65 percent of what his potential is. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7538.3s)]
*  And he feels like because he's such a champion, he feels like that's enough. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7541.38s)]
*  But I guess it's in service of the people that have bought the tickets [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7544.14s)]
*  that have done it. They're trying to not let down the fan base. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7546.860000000001s)]
*  This guy's got a lineage. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7549.1s)]
*  He's got a legacy to worry about. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7550.26s)]
*  I mean, his full career and one loss like that can define you forever [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7552.5s)]
*  because it can change the course of your career. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7556.860000000001s)]
*  Especially if it's a really bad knockout, like if you get completely knocked [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7558.98s)]
*  unconscious, go to the hospital, neck brace, the whole thing, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7562.5s)]
*  wheeled out on a stretcher. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7565.299999999999s)]
*  That can define your entire career. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7567.179999999999s)]
*  It can change the course of your career. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7569.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And that. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7571.78s)]
*  Sorry, just I got to say, this is so surreal that we're talking fighting. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7573.5s)]
*  But like that. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7579.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess everyone wants that kind of Michael Biss being Luke Rockhold [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7582.419999999999s)]
*  to me. Yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7585.82s)]
*  Yeah. In that situation, it worked out great. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7586.62s)]
*  Yeah. It's rolling the dice. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7589.98s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he rolled the dice. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7591.259999999999s)]
*  But Michael Biss being is a crazy dude. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7592.46s)]
*  And that's a guy who fought 10 people with one eye. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7594.46s)]
*  What I yeah, I like that reveal thing where you pull it. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7596.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Just wild. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7598.5s)]
*  Yeah. How I'm quoted, our dad is one eye and he's like a bit [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7600.42s)]
*  of your depth perception. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7604.58s)]
*  Depth perception gets very skewed. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7605.98s)]
*  Yeah. Don't exactly know where things are. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7608.82s)]
*  Yeah. Can you can you do things like VR and stuff with one eye? [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7611.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm sure you probably could. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7614.9400000000005s)]
*  Because I think about like, you know, glasses and people would. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7616.1s)]
*  Right. You wouldn't get that. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7619.3s)]
*  I think VR is different. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7620.660000000001s)]
*  It's like the 3D glasses. Yeah. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7622.660000000001s)]
*  It's that thing. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7625.14s)]
*  Well, we're just talking about it before. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7626.42s)]
*  How crazy is AI going to take over? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7627.860000000001s)]
*  It is, I guess, everything. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7630.620000000001s)]
*  And you can't not fighting. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7632.18s)]
*  Yeah. It depends on how convenient it is to use. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7633.780000000001s)]
*  Like if it gets to glasses, just regular glasses. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7636.700000000001s)]
*  It's going to be I mean, it's going to get better and better [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7640.740000000001s)]
*  and smaller and smaller with battery technology and all sorts of other things [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7643.46s)]
*  that are going to be, you know, all new innovations. Who knows? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7647.1s)]
*  But I think speaking of filming, some people that they're shooting [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7650.74s)]
*  like a Mandalorian on just like screens. Right. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7654.34s)]
*  Yeah. You don't even need to go to locations. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7657.7s)]
*  You get to they could just be any place they want on the screens. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7660.06s)]
*  It'll have really the light will be identical to what it would be out there. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7663.7s)]
*  And then you don't have to worry about, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7667.42s)]
*  you know, taking unit out on helicopters to these places. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7669.86s)]
*  You know, like, you know, lost the TV show. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7673.34s)]
*  They'd fucking had to fly the whole crew over there like and shoot like [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7674.860000000001s)]
*  with the nature and the sound and all that stuff. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7679.18s)]
*  But there's still certain things you can't capture. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7682.38s)]
*  Like, come on, on location. So much cool. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7684.18s)]
*  Yeah. But I guess it kind of feels like, yeah, that's the same as well. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7686.860000000001s)]
*  Like, I like practical, but it kind of feels like I'm down for the screens [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7689.7s)]
*  of sci fi movies as opposed to trying to just say, oh, we'll do that on an island [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7692.62s)]
*  instead of going to an island. Just go to the island. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7696.42s)]
*  You know, if you can afford it. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7697.9800000000005s)]
*  Why? But I think it's but I'm something like [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7699.66s)]
*  because I like practical as well. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7702.620000000001s)]
*  But if, you know, the CGI stuff gets to a point [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7704.34s)]
*  where you literally can't tell the difference between the model car and, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7708.02s)]
*  you know, a real car, then it's like it's kind of like it reminds me of [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7710.3s)]
*  when I was doing Disney videos, movies back in the day [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7714.740000000001s)]
*  where they would draw every single frame. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7717.02s)]
*  And then when that CGI came in, like Toy Story, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7719.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it was the first film to do it with like, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7722.1s)]
*  we don't need to do that anymore. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7723.860000000001s)]
*  We could do it. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7725.46s)]
*  Well, that was a 3D film. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7726.22s)]
*  Yeah. We do it through a computer. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7727.54s)]
*  And then like the truth, you know, it's traditional is to like, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7729.3s)]
*  no, what the fuck? You're like moving it. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7732.26s)]
*  This is a work of art to do each frame. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7733.860000000001s)]
*  But it's kind of like it kind of feels like that now. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7736.18s)]
*  It's like, you got to embrace it. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7737.74s)]
*  I feel like it's different because AI is if you look at the artist, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7739.9800000000005s)]
*  I it's taking. Oh, yeah, I don't know. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7744.06s)]
*  Actually, the fuck is a true conversation. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7745.820000000001s)]
*  That was part of the writer's strike was trying to figure out [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7747.38s)]
*  artificial intelligence and if it can be writing, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7750.1s)]
*  yeah, I writing and incorporating into film writing and screenwriting. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7752.860000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. That's that's even it's horrifying. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7756.14s)]
*  But yeah, it's unavoidable at this point. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7758.78s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like stories coming from the heart is going to always be better [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7761.82s)]
*  than something. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7764.82s)]
*  I think it'd be very difficult to write a movie like Talk to Me [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7765.62s)]
*  and do that through AI. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7769.18s)]
*  Very difficult. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7770.74s)]
*  Yeah, there's something about human creativity, at least at this point. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7771.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, very unique. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7775.26s)]
*  Yeah, because it's drawing from personal experiences, [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7776.66s)]
*  not everyone's experience. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7778.26s)]
*  It's like it's a personal subject. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7779.26s)]
*  It's impossible to replicate it because it hasn't happened to someone else. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7781.34s)]
*  It's their your own personal experience. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7785.14s)]
*  Yeah, it could do things based on things that happened in the past. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7786.9s)]
*  But this isn't like that person's experience. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7790.74s)]
*  I guess it's not an expression of any single person. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7793.339999999999s)]
*  So it can't be unique art. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7796.259999999999s)]
*  Well, listen, guys, whatever you're doing, you're doing awesome shit. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3qfmkJNMmA&t=7798.46s)]
