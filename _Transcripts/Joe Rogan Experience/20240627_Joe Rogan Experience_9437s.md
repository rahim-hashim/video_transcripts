# Joe Rogan Experience #1984 - Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello Joe. What's going on? How you doing? Good. Nice spacesuit. You have a nice spacesuit as well. Cool. Why did you choose blue? I don't know. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=10.0s)]
*  The silver one's a little tense. Yeah, it's a sweat box. It's weird how warm they get. Yeah. It's like one of them emergency blankets. Ever seen them? Those little thin silver ones? Like how can that help you? Yeah. I guess it does somehow. Maintains heat. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=22.0s)]
*  What's it like being a club owner? What's it like to be a club owner to you, sir? It's weird. Who would have ever thought? I know. That makes no sense. When we started doing this podcast that one day we'd both be club owners. Right next door to each other. That's hilarious. Yeah. And people are like, do you, does it bother you, the Red Band, open up a club, three doors down? Like, no, it's great. It's great because it's, you know what it's like? You have two rooms. Like you have your beautiful big boy or whatever. It's like, you know, you're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy. You're a big boy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=36.0s)]
*  But that to me is the main room. Yeah, Fat Man is the main room. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=66.0s)]
*  And then your other one, I think is the O.R. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=68.8s)]
*  And I feel like mine's kind of like the belly room [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=71.64s)]
*  because it has the same like, you know, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=73.8s)]
*  the same kind of shows that are in the belly room, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=75.4s)]
*  the same kind of like the comics are experimenting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=77.14s)]
*  with new things over there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=79.54s)]
*  So it's kind of like the main three now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=80.7s)]
*  I always think it's kind of cool. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=82.98s)]
*  Well, we have so many good spots just on that one street. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=85.08s)]
*  I mean, Vulcan is just a few doors down. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=88.64s)]
*  Creek in the Cave is just a block away. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=91.32s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=93.52s)]
*  It's like and when you're in town and when different comics [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=94.88s)]
*  are in town, like Voss was at the Vulcan [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=98.26s)]
*  and then he came by and did My Club. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=100.52s)]
*  And then, you know, all these different people are doing that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=102.52s)]
*  Just going back and forth. And it's great. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=104.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. I fucking love it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=107.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's and I think it's because there's no major sports teams here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=109.94s)]
*  Right. You know, so there's there's music and comedy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=113.74s)]
*  are the big things in this town. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=116.58s)]
*  I think the music set everybody up for going out to see live shows. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=118.84s)]
*  Yeah, because it's like a culture of going to see live shows in this town [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=122.36s)]
*  that was established by people going to see music. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=126.44s)]
*  There's so much fucking Ellis Bollard got ripped off. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=129.24s)]
*  You see that shit there in South Carolina? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=132.04s)]
*  I think fucking cunts. What happened? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=133.68s)]
*  Dirty thieves. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=136.08s)]
*  He stole the broken news trailer, stole his guitars, amps, everything. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=137.38s)]
*  And now he's got three more shows and no equipment. I saw that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=142.82s)]
*  So is it Ellis Bollard music on Instagram? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=146.26s)]
*  I think he's going to put up a go fund me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=149.16s)]
*  He's got to go out and buy a guitar. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=152.4s)]
*  Look at that. Oh, look at that guitar, too. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=154.0s)]
*  You know, that's the kind of guitar, though, that when somebody tries to sell it, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  it'll probably get back to him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=161.44s)]
*  Well, hopefully because of this, we'll tell everybody. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=163.18s)]
*  But it's what is a 1979 guitar? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=165.78s)]
*  Is that what it said? A dobro? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=170.38s)]
*  Yeah. Eastman, Tendi, Dobro, two telecasters and a custom [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=172.58s)]
*  fucking scumbags. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=177.16s)]
*  It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=178.62s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=180.52s)]
*  He's talented as fuck, too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=182.06s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. 1979, Dobro. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=183.42s)]
*  Yeah, man, that's ugly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=185.8s)]
*  There's some scumbag musician that'll buy that, no one at stolen. Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=188.24s)]
*  Desperate people. That sucks. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=194.1s)]
*  Yeah. Thievery is so gross. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=195.84s)]
*  It's amazing how little there is, though. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=197.84s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about that the other day about car accidents. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=199.94s)]
*  People suck at driving, but God, it's amazing how few car accidents there are. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=202.14s)]
*  Most people every day, you just moving around, no car accident. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=206.12s)]
*  It is weird. And you always you have to have trust in everybody, too. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  Like there's sometimes when you're driving by the semi and you're like, OK, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  I hope you hope you see me. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=215.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's all phones. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=216.86s)]
*  People need that Apple CarPlay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  It's the shit it you don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=220.82000000000002s)]
*  You can do anything that you need to do without ever touching the phone. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=223.66000000000003s)]
*  You just say, hey, Siri, call Redvan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  Bam. Hey, Siri, text my mom. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  What do you want to say? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=232.8s)]
*  And then you just say it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=233.84s)]
*  It's like you can you could say, hey, Siri, navigate to. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=235.18s)]
*  And you go wherever the fuck you need to go. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=239.06s)]
*  You don't have to touch anything. It's the best. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=240.56s)]
*  It's a real bummer that Tesla won't do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=242.4s)]
*  Why won't you do that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=245.04s)]
*  Because they say that theirs is better than Apple. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=246.0s)]
*  It's not. It's one of the worst things I've ever used. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  They get some things right and some things really wrong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=251.44s)]
*  Really wrong is the fob. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=254.98s)]
*  What is it called? It's not called a fob. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=257.52s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=259.38s)]
*  The fucking the car key thing, the stupid handle, the yoke. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  Yoke. Oh, it's so dumb. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=265.18s)]
*  Yeah. This is no no with the yoke. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=267.14s)]
*  Give me a goddamn steering wheel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=269.4s)]
*  Well, now you can. Now you can. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=270.48s)]
*  Now they give you the option. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=271.98s)]
*  You could probably get yours retrofitted with it back on now [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=273.42s)]
*  because they now it's an option when you order a car now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=276.22s)]
*  Can I get the horn in the center, please? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=279.16s)]
*  Exactly. That's the dumbest thing ever. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=280.86s)]
*  Sons of bitches. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=282.56s)]
*  And they also sell third party steering wheels that actually is a yoke. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=283.36s)]
*  But they see the one on the bottom right where a little bit better. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=287.12s)]
*  That's actually cool. Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=291.0s)]
*  That's third party. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=292.26s)]
*  They did a nice interior in that car, too. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=293.06s)]
*  Yeah. The like the interiors like I was in the interior of a Porsche electric car. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=295.32s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=300.92s)]
*  Very nice. That's the new one. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=302.76s)]
*  That's another aftermarket. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=305.82s)]
*  But do they have it as an option? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  Can I like go to Tesla and say, hey, get rid of this wack ass steering wheel? Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. When you order, just go to Tesla dot com and act like you're ordering a car. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=316.24s)]
*  And one of the options should be a model S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=319.48s)]
*  One of the options is you can get a steering wheel. Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  From what I understand, it's just for driving, for actually like turning and parking. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=325.32s)]
*  It's stupid. Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=330.58s)]
*  The yoke is stupid. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  It's funny because when they first when they first. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=333.22s)]
*  They're steering wheel. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=339.3s)]
*  Yeah, you can choose. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=341.2s)]
*  Aha. Give me a goddamn steering wheel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=342.26s)]
*  Yeah. When they first announced it, though, I was like, that is the coolest thing ever. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=345.04s)]
*  I want that so bad. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=347.5s)]
*  But just like the little thing, not putting the horn in the middle and the turn signals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=348.74s)]
*  Looks like the horn. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=352.18s)]
*  No, the horns back in the middle. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=354.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a zoo. Yeah, definitely. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=356.3s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I need. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=358.06s)]
*  Elon, why would you put the horn in the middle? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=359.66s)]
*  Are you sure? Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  Look, what I'm seeing is when I change it from yoke, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=363.06s)]
*  the buttons all stay the same. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  It's just the outside. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because the new yoke has the horn in the center. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=370.1s)]
*  Oh, that does. Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=372.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=374.62s)]
*  They fixed it. The mine doesn't. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=375.94s)]
*  Yeah. It sucks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=377.74s)]
*  Some guy cut in front of me and I was like, Jesus, buddy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  Just looking for the. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=382.14s)]
*  And the turn signal, do you constantly hit the turn signal? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=383.38s)]
*  Always wrong. So accidentally have left, right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=385.94s)]
*  This is the the the stock is the way to go. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. It's so easy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=392.26s)]
*  It never gets in the way. There's nothing back there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=393.9s)]
*  Right. Your hands are never back there. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=396.26s)]
*  So it just go to right to left, right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=398.1s)]
*  We know how to do it. It's perfect. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=400.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's even that second stock that I even forget that that's even there sometimes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=402.18s)]
*  because I don't even see it. Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=406.14s)]
*  The one in behind this left stock. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=408.02s)]
*  Well, that's the adjuster. Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=410.02s)]
*  But there's like a whole thing there you never see, you know, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=411.66s)]
*  in doing everything on the screen to make things simple. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=414.18s)]
*  They make things way more complicated. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=418.9s)]
*  Like if you have to adjust your mirrors, Jesus Christ. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=421.06s)]
*  Right. You got to get in there and do it and then lift for the left and lift for the right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=424.74s)]
*  No. Stop. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=430.62s)]
*  You're making me think too much. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=432.42s)]
*  When my car, I don't even have to look at it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=434.3s)]
*  I just reach over. I press the button and I can adjust it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  I just do it real quick. Easy. It's better. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=440.78s)]
*  Physical buttons are better. Always. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=443.7s)]
*  Always. Slide to reverse. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=445.7s)]
*  The worst is when the car has their volume knob and adjustments on the screen. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=447.14s)]
*  Oh, terrible. Am I touching up volume? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  You want to be able to do it where you can keep looking at the road. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  You just reach over, grab the knob, turn it to the left, turn it to the right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=458.74s)]
*  You know, volume. We know how to do it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=463.02s)]
*  Temperature. Easy. Button. Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=465.3s)]
*  Button go high. Button go low. Come on. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=467.5s)]
*  Just make the buttons look sexier. Yeah. Or prettier. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=470.02s)]
*  Porsche knows how to do it. Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=472.34s)]
*  Porsche's got all buttons. They figured it out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=473.82s)]
*  I looked in their interior. I'm like, this is a better interior. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=476.9s)]
*  They know how to do it. They've been doing cars forever. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=479.7s)]
*  Everybody tries to reinvent the wheel. Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  Some parts like blinkers. Click, click, click, click. Keep it like that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  Don't be putting it on the steering wheel like an asshole. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=489.06s)]
*  And companies are coming back to it. Also, look at the latest MacBook Pros. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=491.14s)]
*  They're bringing back the SD card reader. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  They're bringing back all the ports that they got rid of. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=495.78s)]
*  Oh, are they really? Yeah, but then you hear these rumors [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=497.98s)]
*  that the iPhone is going to get rid of buttons and it's, you know, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=500.14s)]
*  it's going to have zero buttons. The whole thing is... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=503.1s)]
*  What disturbs me is going to all wireless charging. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=505.42s)]
*  Ugh. Like, why are you doing that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=507.78s)]
*  That's the worst. You know it's slower. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=511.1s)]
*  Like, just making that everyone has to have a wireless port somewhere. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=512.82s)]
*  Everyone has cords, man. Keep the cords. Just go to USB-C. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=515.94s)]
*  You see that? I saw a loop post of this yesterday. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=519.86s)]
*  It's like a new... Prototype. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=521.78s)]
*  Yeah. Who knows if this is how it's going to be. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=524.38s)]
*  It's going to have the new USB-C port, which is the... [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=526.18s)]
*  This is the Ultra? Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=528.66s)]
*  It's basically the same, but I guess that's like the Ultra watch, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=530.62s)]
*  I think, probably with the titanium outside, maybe. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=534.54s)]
*  So what is different? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=535.98s)]
*  The screen border is a lot smaller. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=537.78s)]
*  It has a USB-C port now. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=541.66s)]
*  And the volume rocker is not... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=545.02s)]
*  It's not two buttons anymore. It's one long button. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=547.98s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=550.14s)]
*  And the mute button, the clicky switch to mute that never works, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=551.86s)]
*  is now a button that's going to be used for, like, an action button, I guess. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=556.14s)]
*  So how will you mute it now? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=560.86s)]
*  You probably hold that down for a second or something like that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=562.86s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=565.1s)]
*  Look at this top comment. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=567.02s)]
*  I will never use an iPhone. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=568.22s)]
*  Android people are hilarious. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  They are so in a cult. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  They really don't... Like, they're... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  We're against the machine, man. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=577.66s)]
*  Literally, your phone is used by more humans than any other phone on Earth. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  I sent him photos to a group chat last night, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=583.7s)]
*  and half a second group chat without the Android person, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=585.5s)]
*  so they can get the photos uncompressed and they look good. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=588.3000000000001s)]
*  Because in that group chat, they're all fucked. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=591.5s)]
*  They can't see the photos. I don't know if you know that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=592.7800000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=595.5s)]
*  If you have an Android person in your iPhone group chat, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=596.98s)]
*  they get the photos good. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=599.7800000000001s)]
*  That Android will get them. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  But everybody else, every other phone will not get them good. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=602.86s)]
*  Why? Oh, because it compresses it because of the text. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=605.22s)]
*  And then it goes to everybody else. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=608.02s)]
*  You have to, like, leave them out, make a new group chat, be like, sorry. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=609.74s)]
*  Is that why it always says, like, message failed to send? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=612.94s)]
*  And then I'll send it, like, 10 more times, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  and people are like, why does he send me this 10 times? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  Because it keeps on saying it failed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=620.7800000000001s)]
*  So it's like if you text message from an iPhone, it's inferior. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=622.82s)]
*  If you text message an image, which texts, not SMS. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=626.94s)]
*  Not trying to talk shit on the Androids, but that's what I... [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=630.86s)]
*  They'll see it perfectly fine and be like, what are you talking about? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=632.94s)]
*  I see it looks great on my phone. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=634.94s)]
*  Look, I'll send you photos. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=636.86s)]
*  But it gets compressed to the iPhone. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=637.82s)]
*  But yeah, when it goes from that Android to the network again, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=639.3000000000001s)]
*  it'll be dog shit on those fucking Androids or on iPhones, I'm sorry. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=642.6199999999999s)]
*  Especially video, especially video. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=646.9799999999999s)]
*  It's very frustrating that you can't just go back and forth, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  that they've created this walled garden with Apple, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=651.26s)]
*  because, like, one thing that Android does that's really good [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=654.66s)]
*  is they're always the first with, like, foldables. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=658.14s)]
*  They're the first with crazy zoom lenses. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=661.66s)]
*  They're the first with... [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=664.0999999999999s)]
*  They figure out everything first. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=665.5s)]
*  They have way better screen real estate. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=667.26s)]
*  There's much more screen to an Android phone than there is to an iPhone. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=669.14s)]
*  You know, that stupid fucking... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=672.14s)]
*  What is that thing in the top that nobody really cares about? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=673.9s)]
*  Right, the island. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=676.38s)]
*  The island. Fuck out of here with your island. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=677.6199999999999s)]
*  Who's using that island? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  Android has better fake moons. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=681.66s)]
*  Yeah, the fake moon. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  You think I'm so busted with that fake moon. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=685.02s)]
*  You can't sneak things past the Internet. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=688.06s)]
*  When those guys figured out that you could take a blurry photo [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=691.8199999999999s)]
*  and put it up on a laptop and then zoom in on it [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=694.9799999999999s)]
*  and your phone will make it look perfect. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=697.42s)]
*  And I always wondered about that, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=699.6199999999999s)]
*  because when you got the Galaxy S21, you sent me a phone, a moon photo. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=700.7s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=705.1800000000001s)]
*  And it made me want one so bad. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=706.7800000000001s)]
*  You know, it was pretty cool. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=708.82s)]
*  But now I feel like a loser. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=710.98s)]
*  He just sent me a JPEG. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=712.74s)]
*  I'd say you had drawing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  NFT. Yeah, it was fucking CGI. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  What are they saying it is? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=720.3000000000001s)]
*  Because it's clearly whatever that process is, it's not a photograph. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=721.94s)]
*  No, it's like AI. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=728.46s)]
*  It's pretty much it knows what the moon looks like. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=729.62s)]
*  And it uses yours as a reference to find what angle you are at. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=732.18s)]
*  And then it just kind of fills in the gaps. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=736.54s)]
*  So stupid. It's not a photo. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=738.38s)]
*  It's not a photo. It's fake. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=740.94s)]
*  Like, how do they not get in trouble with that? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=743.38s)]
*  That seems like that's a real like violation of trust. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=745.58s)]

*  Oh, alcohol is basically poison. Absolutely. But. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=879.38s)]
*  Tequila seems to be the best poison. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=883.3s)]
*  Like your body absorbs it the best. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=885.1s)]
*  Better. There's no really hangovers as much with that also. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=887.22s)]

*  It's just like the most sugary drink that doesn't have sugar in it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=932.94s)]
*  What are they using for a sweetener? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=935.74s)]
*  I don't know. I haven't had the hydration one, but I had the energy drink one. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=938.0200000000001s)]
*  It was pretty good. Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=941.34s)]
*  I mean, they taste amazing, but they also taste like like Kool-Aid [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=942.98s)]
*  like with three times the sugar in it. Really? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=946.74s)]
*  So it's really good. I mix this with like vodka and stuff. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=949.2600000000001s)]
*  It's a good mixer. But. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=952.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's too much, too strong. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=954.5s)]
*  Well, that hydration market, all of a sudden, everyone's realizing [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=956.3000000000001s)]
*  they're not hydrated. Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=960.58s)]
*  There's so many hydration products out now. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=963.74s)]
*  And all those hydration products, the sodium content in those are out of control. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=965.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you ever looked at like just like one of the hydration products, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=971.5s)]
*  sodium levels, because I've been drinking like two or three of these [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=974.94s)]
*  thinking I'm drinking water, like doing good for my body. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=978.1800000000001s)]
*  But then you look at the sodium levels, like 1000 milligrams. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=980.58s)]
*  I don't necessarily think sodium in and of itself is bad for you. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=983.74s)]
*  No, no. I think that's the electrolytes and stuff they're adding. Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=988.6600000000001s)]
*  Some of that you want. Yeah, you want some. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=992.86s)]
*  Right. Particularly if you're exercising, like if that's an athletic drink, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=995.02s)]
*  then you definitely want some sodium. You want all kinds of stuff. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=999.02s)]
*  This only has 10, so that's not bad at all. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1002.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1004.5400000000001s)]
*  I think that's one of those things where there's like a lot of common [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  misconceptions like salt, like people worried about salt bad for you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1009.4200000000001s)]
*  Salt's an essential mineral. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1013.1800000000001s)]
*  Like you actually need salt. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1014.74s)]
*  Like it's I don't necessarily think salt's bad for you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1016.62s)]
*  I think we've got a lot of wives tales floating around and people, you know, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1019.1800000000001s)]
*  had some information at one point in time that seemed to link [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1024.02s)]
*  sodium to certain diseases. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1027.9s)]
*  But now I don't think they think that anymore. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1029.66s)]
*  But let's let's find like is sodium bad for you? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1033.18s)]
*  Like sodium in sports drinks. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1035.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Joey Diaz used to always tell you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1037.06s)]
*  Yeah, but that's just Joey. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1039.46s)]

*  Found out there's something bad in it now. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1050.9s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I might be wrong, but [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1052.58s)]
*  I thought that was supposed to be the salt that's exactly. Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1056.46s)]
*  That might. I think brown rice. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1059.22s)]
*  Maybe it's because they're not getting it all from there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1060.94s)]
*  And they're saying it's that. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1062.82s)]

*  and get millions of dollars. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1148.78s)]
*  My girlfriend just went to an allergy person [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1150.82s)]
*  where she had to get like a thousand shots and find out what she's allergic to. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1153.54s)]
*  And she's allergic to everything. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1156.58s)]
*  And they she doesn't have insurance. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1158.26s)]
*  So they and they she went to the doctor and they were like, OK, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1160.62s)]
*  we'll work with you not having insurance. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1164.1s)]
*  And they finally prescribed her her pill. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1165.94s)]
*  And it was like twelve hundred dollars a pill or something like that. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1168.42s)]
*  Like she went to go pick up her prescription and it was thousands of dollars. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1173.34s)]
*  And she had to do it like every two weeks to get it filled up. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1177.78s)]
*  How would you ever like one pill is a thousand bucks for allergies? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1181.78s)]
*  Yes, I wish I knew what it was. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1186.1s)]
*  But like it was the most ridiculous thing ever. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1188.1399999999999s)]
*  Like how would you expect anyone to pay for this? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1190.86s)]
*  And you have these pills at H.E.B. right now. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  That's what that Martin Scorelli guy, whatever his name was. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1196.82s)]
*  That's what he got in trouble for. Right. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1200.4199999999998s)]
*  Jacking up the price. Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1201.8999999999999s)]
*  So what's the what's the story with sodium? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1204.26s)]
*  So I got an answer from Chad GPT. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1206.6599999999999s)]
*  It basically started off saying the same thing. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1208.62s)]
*  But down here it gives like a recommended. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1210.1s)]
*  OK. Sodium is an essential nutrient. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1211.86s)]
*  The body needs small amounts to function properly. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1213.6999999999998s)]
*  It helps maintain the balance of fluids in the body and supports nerve [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1215.62s)]
*  and muscle function and helps regulate blood pressure. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  However, consuming too much sodium can have negative health effects. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1220.78s)]
*  The most common concern with consuming too much sodium [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1224.6999999999998s)]
*  is that it can increase blood pressure, which can lead to higher risk [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1227.9399999999998s)]
*  of heart disease and stroke. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1230.9399999999998s)]
*  High sodium intake can also increase the risk of developing kidney issues [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1233.1s)]
*  and osteoporosis. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1237.54s)]
*  Recommended daily intake of sodium varies depending on age, sex [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1239.34s)]
*  and other factors. But in general, adults should aim to consume [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1242.42s)]
*  no more than two thousand three hundred milligrams of sodium per day. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1245.38s)]
*  It's not that much. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1249.02s)]
*  You know, foods that are high in sodium include processed and packaged foods, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1250.66s)]
*  fast food, salty snacks. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1253.94s)]
*  See, that's my point. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1255.66s)]
*  It's like all that stuff like it's associated with it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1257.02s)]
*  But is it causal? Right. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1261.58s)]
*  Is that what's causing it? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1263.26s)]
*  Because the thing about people with high sodium diets [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1264.94s)]
*  is usually their diet is bullshit. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1267.34s)]
*  They're just eating all kinds of crap. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1269.82s)]
*  Like if you have regular food, like healthy food, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1272.06s)]
*  but you put salt on it, is that bad? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1276.26s)]
*  Because I'm betting it's not that bad. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1278.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm betting whatever the fuck is in the other stuff is what's getting you. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1281.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like whenever they do those epidemiology studies [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1285.74s)]
*  where they study like your diet based on like a [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1288.78s)]
*  you fill out a form like how many times a week do you eat me? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1293.86s)]
*  How many times? How much cancer you have? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1297.46s)]
*  And then they like pull all that information together and they go. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1299.1399999999999s)]
*  Meat is associated with cancer. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1302.1s)]
*  Well, it's like what else you eating? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1304.3799999999999s)]
*  Are you eating grass fed steaks? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1306.62s)]
*  Are you eating some shitty burger that's [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1308.86s)]
*  in a fucking processed bun with some goofy ass mayo with salt [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1312.3s)]
*  or sugar all over it and fries and shakes? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1316.98s)]
*  Like, how do we know it's the meat? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1321.18s)]
*  You know, it sounds like your diet's bullshit. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  So many people have bullshit diets. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1326.3s)]
*  Yeah. That said, like salt can kill you. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1328.78s)]
*  Like if you like eat a pound of salt, you're fucking dead as shit. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1331.94s)]
*  They used to think MSG was like this horrible monster. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1337.3s)]
*  And people still anymore. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1340.38s)]
*  I don't think they think it's bad anymore. Right. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1342.18s)]
*  It's not bad anymore. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1343.98s)]
*  Yeah. Monosodium glutamate used to be the devil. Right. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1345.06s)]
*  And there was a reason for it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1347.46s)]
*  And it was something really stupid. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1348.9s)]
*  It was like legal, like legalization of marijuana is stupid. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1350.3400000000001s)]
*  Like, really, it was never bad for you. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1353.02s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1354.74s)]
*  It's not industry or something. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1356.3799999999999s)]
*  Bourdain always told me it wasn't bad for you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1357.98s)]
*  It's like, no, it's essential. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1359.9s)]
*  It makes food taste way better, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1361.42s)]
*  especially like that kind of old school East Coast Chinese food. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1364.02s)]
*  With monosodium glutamate, it was the best. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1367.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the best. It's delicious. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1369.18s)]
*  The best. Put in more MSG. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1371.22s)]
*  Don't eat it every day. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1374.78s)]
*  And for imitation crab, do you know imitation crab is actually really good? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1376.46s)]
*  Like if you're seeing those imitation crab legs at the grocery store [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1380.74s)]
*  and they look real, but it's just imitation. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1383.46s)]
*  It's it tastes exactly like crab legs. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1385.82s)]
*  Well, what's in there? It's just fish. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1387.74s)]
*  Yoga mats. It's just. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1389.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1390.94s)]
*  I thought it was just like yoga mats and like like wheat or something. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1391.74s)]
*  No, it's fish. It's just a different kind of fish. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1395.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, ask him Pollock. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1399.54s)]
*  OK. And it made ingredient Pollock tastes good, though. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1401.38s)]
*  And if you get some wheat, that's it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1405.5s)]
*  Wait, it is. We eat an egg white. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1407.5s)]
*  Yeah. Binding ingredients. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1408.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1410.98s)]
*  Because one of my kids cannot have imitation crab meat because of that. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1412.1s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1418.3799999999999s)]
*  There was wheat in it for real. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1419.82s)]
*  But you get some like hot butter. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1422.3s)]
*  Those things are just it's amazing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1424.54s)]
*  Look at that word. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1426.5s)]
*  Transglutamines, transglutamines, enzymes. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1428.9399999999998s)]
*  That's a coagulation binding agent. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1435.7s)]
*  Oh, that's a good. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1437.74s)]
*  Just just the regular Pollock [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1441.6200000000001s)]
*  with not doesn't have wheat and fucking binding agents in it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1445.34s)]
*  But it tastes good. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1449.74s)]
*  Tastes exactly the same. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1450.74s)]
*  Yeah. If you get like there's certain Chinese food, they give you a fake fake. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1451.82s)]
*  Right. Sushi. Some sushi has it also. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1455.02s)]
*  It's good, though. Tasty. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1457.54s)]
*  But it is wheat. You're eating a lot of wheat. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1458.82s)]
*  It is crazy that there's wheat in there. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1460.6200000000001s)]
*  I was just joking about it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1462.34s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense because it's like dough. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They have to take all that fish meat and just smash it into shape. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1467.82s)]
*  There's a chef in New York at a restaurant that used transglutamines [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1472.3s)]
*  treated shrimp and made pasta out of it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1475.94s)]

*  You know, like white people tacos like your parents used to make. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1526.22s)]
*  Found out that back in the 60s, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1528.78s)]
*  this guy was friends with the creator of Taco Bell, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1532.22s)]
*  and he had a couple of franchises. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1535.66s)]
*  And then that guy that owned Taco Bell sold the company to Pepsi [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1537.62s)]
*  in like the 80s or so. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1541.5s)]
*  And the guy that had like all that was friends with him [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1543.26s)]
*  had all these his own Taco Bell restaurants. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1545.66s)]
*  And he's like, fuck Pepsi. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1547.82s)]
*  You know, I'm just going to rename my [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1548.86s)]
*  franchises to Taco Casa, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1552.06s)]
*  but keep the exact same menu that Taco Bell has and all the ingredients. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1554.5s)]
*  Pepsi then changed all the the recipes for Taco Bell. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1559.1s)]
*  And that's why Taco Bell, when you were a kid, seemed like it [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1564.22s)]
*  tasted better and everything was better. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1566.78s)]
*  It's because they changed all their meats and they changed all their ingredients. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1568.86s)]
*  Taco Casa is Taco Bell from the 60s, 70s with the original menu items. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1572.54s)]
*  It even has the color scheme as the old advertising of Taco Bell. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1578.1s)]
*  Yeah. And you go in there and you're like, holy shit, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1582.18s)]
*  this is the best tacos ever. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1584.98s)]
*  And it's just Taco Bell from the 60s. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1587.38s)]
*  And it is amazing. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1589.38s)]
*  Wow. Highly recommend. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1591.42s)]
*  And they're fans of you. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1592.7s)]
*  They because I always Instagram and tag them and stuff places. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1594.38s)]
*  That's crazy. It's weird. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1598.94s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1601.5s)]
*  Like if there was a McDonald's you go to, there was a real McDonald's [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1602.5800000000002s)]
*  from the 50s where they cooked all their fries and beef fat. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1605.54s)]
*  Yeah, exactly the same. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1609.7s)]
*  Yeah. I just got it again for the first time recently, maybe three years. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1611.34s)]
*  McDonald's, the Big Mac was so fucking small. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1616.02s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, they're all small now. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1619.1399999999999s)]
*  Is the small is like a regular burger size. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1621.1s)]
*  Everything's smaller now. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1623.1s)]
*  Yeah. The quarter pounder is the only good meat at McDonald's also, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1624.3s)]
*  because that's the only one that's not frozen. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1628.78s)]
*  So if you want a Big Mac, you ask for a Big Mac with quarter pounder meat. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1630.6999999999998s)]
*  That's the way to do it. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1635.86s)]
*  Hmm. Oh, yeah, I guess. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1637.3s)]
*  Well, they did do this, but it still it was so small. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1638.6599999999999s)]
*  Like they made a bigger Mac at one point, but it was a fuck. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1640.78s)]
*  It was so tiny. Really? Yeah. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1643.58s)]
*  It wasn't filling at all. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1645.62s)]
*  It was like five bites into the whole fucking thing was gone. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1646.46s)]
*  Well, Whopper also, I don't know if you've had a Whopper lately. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1648.82s)]
*  There's more. It's it's just bullshit. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1651.62s)]
*  It's like it doesn't even have that that you know, how it used to taste [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1653.54s)]
*  like smoke and everything. Yeah. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1656.82s)]
*  Flame broiled. I don't have that anymore. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1658.42s)]
*  And I guess Burger King just announced they're closing like [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1660.06s)]
*  250 stores like they're on the way out, I think. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1664.5s)]
*  How do you get to fuck with In-N-Out? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1668.34s)]
*  Had it last night. You can't. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1671.18s)]
*  You can't. You can't. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1672.74s)]
*  Like there's a reason why that has a giant ass line. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1673.86s)]
*  Not where I live. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1676.86s)]
*  There's you just walk right up to the counter. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1677.74s)]
*  There's not one car in the drive through is the most amazing thing ever. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1679.74s)]
*  You shouldn't tell people that. I know. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1682.94s)]
*  You fucked up. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1684.66s)]
*  If there was a five guys near me, I'd pick that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1686.26s)]
*  That's my favorite. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1688.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's right next door to five guys. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1689.1399999999999s)]
*  They're the best. Yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1690.82s)]
*  I think that's the best because you can get jalapenos and bacon. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1692.1399999999999s)]
*  They're so expensive, though. That's ridiculous. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1695.78s)]
*  One burger is like $13. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1697.94s)]
*  I guess it's not fast food, though. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1700.1s)]
*  You have that's what you have to tell yourself. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1701.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. They're cooking in front of you. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1703.06s)]
*  The fries are better. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1706.1s)]
*  They have those Cajun fries. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1707.74s)]
*  NADC burger. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1708.82s)]
*  I've talked to talking to him. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1709.98s)]
*  They're using awesome meat that like you can't get everywhere else. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1711.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. They're using Wagyu ground beef. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1714.6999999999998s)]
*  It's so fatty. Yes. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1716.86s)]
*  That's why it's so god damn juicy. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1718.1799999999998s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1719.86s)]
*  Yeah. Those NADC burgers. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1720.58s)]
*  It's like it's hard to fuck with that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1722.4199999999998s)]
*  But Golden Tiger is pretty god damn good, too. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1724.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You just have to wait a while. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1727.54s)]
*  That place is the bomb diggity. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1728.98s)]
*  Yeah. Good. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1731.5s)]
*  It's funny how like thick burgers used to be the thing. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1732.38s)]
*  But a smash burger is better than a thick burger. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1735.7s)]
*  I agree. Double patty smash burger. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1738.1s)]
*  That's the crispy ends and stuff like that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1740.74s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1742.58s)]
*  That's the way to go. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1744.14s)]
*  I just love when you get a guy like Philip, who is a Michelin star chef [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1745.38s)]
*  who just concentrates on making the best cheese burger with American cheese. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1749.98s)]
*  That's the idea. Yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1755.06s)]
*  And he's like, American cheese is the proper cheese for a cheese burger like this. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1756.82s)]
*  For a proper smash burger. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1760.58s)]
*  I would say he would tackle pizza. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1762.62s)]
*  I want to see his take on pizza. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1764.1s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1766.1799999999998s)]
*  Flat pizza. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1767.86s)]
*  What would it be? What kind of style would it be? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1769.5s)]
*  Does Austin have good pizza? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1771.9399999999998s)]
*  Is there one place that has like really good pizza? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1773.26s)]
*  There's one place up by me called San Giovanni's or something like that. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1776.46s)]
*  It's a distillery during the week, a vodka distillery. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1780.1799999999998s)]
*  And then on Friday and Saturdays, they have a legit pizza oven [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1783.34s)]
*  and they cook pizza and it's so amazing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1788.3799999999999s)]
*  Have you had good pizza out here? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1791.1799999999998s)]
*  It's hit or miss. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1792.74s)]
*  That's not I mean, Ohio pizza is what we grew up on. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1794.5s)]
*  Yeah. So we have very high standards for it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1797.34s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1800.82s)]
*  This place that I went to in the Bronx, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1802.54s)]
*  that the Italian deli that made us a sandwich, GNR deli, that place, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1804.34s)]
*  if they moved out here, that they would make a fucking killing. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1808.58s)]
*  Have you had a place like that that made sandwiches like that out here? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1812.8999999999999s)]
*  Pepper place. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1815.54s)]
*  They get the same stuff. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1816.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's important. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1818.2199999999998s)]
*  Oh, OK. It's all important for Italy. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1819.7399999999998s)]
*  I mean, how what would be the difference? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  Nothing is important to hear. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1825.6999999999998s)]
*  The thing they've always said, like when we're in California, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1826.9799999999998s)]
*  it's like it's the water, the water sucks out here. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1828.78s)]
*  It's why you can't get the right dough. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1830.82s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know if that's really it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1832.3s)]
*  In Ohio, a lot of it's the oven. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1834.5s)]
*  Like they've made these ovens they don't use everywhere else. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1836.1799999999998s)]
*  Like that was always the thing about California, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1838.4599999999998s)]
*  that the water in California sucks. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1841.1799999999998s)]
*  That's why the bagels suck. Right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1842.7s)]
*  Everyone always said that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1844.86s)]
*  I mean, maybe can't you just ship water? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1846.7s)]
*  Like how much water do you need? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1849.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like is this prohibitively expensive? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1851.06s)]
*  Is it impossible to do? Like, what is wrong? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1853.86s)]
*  I don't know. It doesn't make sense. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1855.54s)]
*  I feel like I've heard it busted, like a myth busted. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1856.54s)]
*  But yeah, maybe it is. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1858.6599999999999s)]
*  But what do you think is in water other than water that would make your pizza? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1859.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, the thing that makes sense, as I'm saying it out loud now, is the yeast, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1863.82s)]
*  because that's in the air, isn't it? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1866.86s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1868.02s)]
*  And that come from like the environment. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1868.98s)]
*  Yeast is like, well, it's a fungus. Right. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1871.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Or spores that changes the dough. Yeah. Right. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1874.42s)]
*  Like they're different yeast because of different water. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1878.22s)]
*  Well, what would be the content of the water? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1881.1s)]
*  That's the question. It's like water is not a mystery. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1882.7s)]
*  You know, water is not like some strange compound from another planet [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1885.46s)]
*  that we have to analyze. Like we kind of know what's in water. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1888.46s)]
*  H2O and minerals. Right. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1891.62s)]
*  So can you add minerals that would sort of recreate whatever the mineral? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1893.42s)]
*  Yeah, you should be able to recreate a little bit of rat hair in there. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  A little bit of fucking SSRIs [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1902.02s)]
*  floating into the open a bagel shop. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1905.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Sounds like pizza. Pizza. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1906.98s)]
*  Pizza is the move. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1909.4199999999998s)]
*  We need like a real legit pizza place here. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1910.78s)]
*  Maybe there's one we don't know of yet. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1914.34s)]
*  I've I sampled them frequently. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1915.86s)]
*  Yeah. If not once or twice a week. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1917.78s)]
*  The person asked is Portnoy because I know I did ask him. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1919.6599999999999s)]
*  So the place he went to, I'd never heard of. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1922.94s)]
*  It's called like San Matoro or something like that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1924.7s)]
*  I've had it now and it's pretty good. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1926.42s)]
*  It's just it's not my style of pizza. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1928.26s)]
*  I don't think it's his style of pizza either. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1929.66s)]
*  It's a little more. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1931.3400000000001s)]
*  It's way too nice, kind of. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1934.3400000000001s)]
*  It's really kind of thick, bready crust. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1935.46s)]
*  He likes more of like a New York style crust like New Haven, Connecticut pizza. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1938.46s)]
*  Yeah, he hasn't found a good one here in Austin. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1942.98s)]
*  And then like last week, he said that Houston is the worst city [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1944.94s)]
*  in that he's ever been to for pizza. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1948.26s)]
*  So it's all in where the guineas go. Yeah. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1950.74s)]
*  You know, if the Italians go to, you know, California, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1953.6599999999999s)]
*  they'd have great pizza out there. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1956.94s)]
*  And some of them did. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1958.26s)]
*  There's there's some good pizza in California. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1959.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Regardless of whatever he says. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1961.98s)]
*  But the bread does taste different. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1963.4199999999998s)]
*  Bread in New York really does taste different. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1965.5s)]
*  Italian bread from New York tastes better. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1967.4199999999998s)]
*  It's like there's something missing when you get bread in California. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1970.1s)]
*  Like there's something wrong with it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1973.1399999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. Just something just like an imitation. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1974.54s)]
*  Like it's pretty good. It's missing something. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1977.1399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's the East. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1980.34s)]
*  Maybe it's the East. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1982.86s)]
*  I'm going to Google and see if there's a quick answer. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1984.1s)]
*  Well, you know, like there's like where Cuban cigars are grown. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1985.98s)]
*  It's a very small area where they grow the best cigars. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1988.98s)]
*  It's very small and they supply them to the whole world. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1992.34s)]
*  So I was just explaining to me, oh, Bill Burr was explaining to me how [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  most of the cigars that people buy when they they buy Cuban cigars are frauds. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=1999.98s)]
*  Fake. Yeah, it just happened to him. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2005.22s)]
*  A bunch of firemen gave him like like 25 Cuban cigars. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2007.14s)]
*  And he was like, I got these cigars. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2010.5800000000002s)]
*  And then like a week later, he said on his podcast that he found out [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2012.0200000000002s)]
*  they were all fake. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2014.98s)]
*  How do you find out? You get them genetically tested? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2016.22s)]
*  Yeah. How do you know? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2018.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But it makes sense because it's a small area. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2021.42s)]
*  This area in Cuba where they grow the best cigars is not that big. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2026.22s)]
*  And they supplies the best cigars of the whole world. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2030.8200000000002s)]
*  So it's weird that like soil can affect stuff so much. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2033.3799999999999s)]
*  Like the mineral content. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2038.18s)]
*  That's the 100 percent article I'm reading right now. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2040.02s)]
*  It's talking about how they change the what they're putting in the soil [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2042.26s)]
*  to grow wheat and whatnot that. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2045.4199999999998s)]
*  Makes the air better, but makes the food not as good. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2048.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, this throws off everything because L.A. has the worst air ever. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2050.86s)]
*  So less acid rain is good for the environment, but potentially bad for bread. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2053.7799999999997s)]
*  But I don't think they're growing the bread in California is the problem. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2058.54s)]
*  Yeah. The Wonder Bread factories aren't out there. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2062.3s)]
*  Wonder Bread is not even bread. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2065.1400000000003s)]
*  So it's so good. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2067.1400000000003s)]
*  Wonder Bread with peanut butter and jelly is about as like [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2068.6600000000003s)]
*  is that food or is that dessert? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2071.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's a squishy sandwich. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2073.0600000000004s)]
*  Sunday night might be just more dessert than it is food. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2074.78s)]
*  Like a Wonder Bread, peanut butter and jelly sandwich is [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2078.1400000000003s)]
*  Wonder Bread, grilled cheese. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2081.02s)]
*  Sensational. Yes. Sensational. I agree. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2082.3s)]
*  But is it really bread? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2085.2200000000003s)]
*  No, that's more like a pastry or a pastry. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2086.6200000000003s)]
*  But I just recently went back to White Bread just because I accidentally [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2090.1s)]
*  bought it once and it was so amazing. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2094.14s)]
*  Like that peanut butter jelly hits so much better. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2096.54s)]
*  We just shitty white bread. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2099.02s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you're going to eat peanut butter and jelly, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2100.74s)]
*  peanut butter and jelly is not good for you anyway. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2103.22s)]
*  Let's stop playing games. Right. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2105.02s)]
*  Have another piece of white bread. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2106.58s)]
*  It's not good for you, but I also don't feel bad when I eat it for some. Right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, when we were in New York, we stopped at Katz's deli. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2112.18s)]
*  Three o'clock in the morning. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2115.8199999999997s)]
*  Had a Reuben. Oh, my God. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2117.34s)]
*  It was sensational. Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2118.94s)]
*  It's that high. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2120.54s)]
*  It's just oozing with sauerkraut and David. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2122.02s)]
*  Do you think that's unnecessary, though? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2125.1400000000003s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2126.54s)]
*  Like you don't have to have that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2127.7000000000003s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, you communist. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2128.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's just crazy. It's amazing. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2131.78s)]
*  Look, it was so good, dude. Wow. It was so good. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2133.6200000000003s)]
*  And it's just the fact that it's the same place. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2136.42s)]
*  Every time you go back, this guy that we've been going to, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2139.98s)]
*  every time we go to this one meat cutter, like the way Cantor's works [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2142.42s)]
*  or excuse me, the way Katz's works. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2146.42s)]
*  Cantor's my favorite spot in L.A. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2148.5s)]
*  But the way Katz's works, you get a ticket when you walk in [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2150.38s)]
*  and then you get a bunch of things punched on the ticket. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2154.3s)]
*  Then you pay on the way out the door. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2157.38s)]
*  Well, when you walk up to the meat cutter, then you give the guy your ticket [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2159.34s)]
*  and tell him what you want. He writes down the ticket. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2164.02s)]
*  He gives you a little slice of pastrami to try. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2166.1s)]
*  And this guy's been the same guy we've been going to for a decade. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2168.7000000000003s)]
*  And finally, we had a conversation with him. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2172.86s)]
*  And he goes, I'm celebrating 33 years here. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2174.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, 33 years. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2177.1s)]
*  Like he started there when he was a kid. Wow. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2179.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. What a life. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2181.4599999999996s)]
*  Can you imagine your whole life working at the same [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2183.7799999999997s)]
*  like a food place? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2187.14s)]
*  Probably long hours to that's the place. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2188.5s)]
*  That's so crazy. Classic. Nice. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2191.3799999999997s)]
*  It's so classic. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2194.18s)]
*  And it's been the same interior since like, you know, the fucking early 1900s. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2195.5s)]
*  It's just an amazing place. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2201.06s)]
*  It's a real like New York staple. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2203.3s)]
*  And all those guys that are working behind the counter, the meat cutters, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2206.3s)]
*  if you see the meat cutters in there, those guys are all like classic [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2209.86s)]
*  New York characters. Yeah. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2214.2200000000003s)]
*  I could already imagine what they look like. Yeah. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2216.34s)]
*  Why is there not a picture of them? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2219.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just the food and people eating there. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2220.94s)]
*  Whatever. Yeah. It's awesome. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2223.86s)]
*  Old spots like that are the shit that there's just been. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2226.5s)]
*  There's something about old places like that's one of the things about [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2229.42s)]
*  the club that we have is there's something about that old ass building. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2233.1s)]
*  It's amazing. That building has got like a personality. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2237.3s)]
*  I was watching a documentary about that place, your place [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2240.38s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago when it was still a movie theater. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2243.66s)]
*  And like they were in the projection room. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2245.94s)]
*  And I guess that projection room would be weird around where the green room is. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2247.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And so it was really cool seeing it and seeing the differences and stuff. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2252.34s)]
*  One thing did you guys put in the spaceship when you walk into the lobby? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2256.7s)]
*  Or was that already there? Yeah, we put that. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2260.18s)]
*  Well, it's weird because I just played the other Alamo theater the other day. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2262.26s)]
*  They have an amazing little room in there and they have almost an exact [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2266.78s)]
*  replica of that spaceship on the second floor. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2270.1400000000003s)]
*  Like that's crashed, right? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2273.6600000000003s)]
*  Or you know, like the round the round. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2275.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yes. It's because is that's Richard, too, right? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2278.5800000000004s)]
*  Is that Richard Weiss that he designed that? I believe he did. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2283.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, did it? Because I was like, it's so familiar. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2287.34s)]
*  That's because that's the recreation of the close encounters of the third [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2290.2200000000003s)]
*  con scene, which is amazing scene. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2293.5s)]
*  Remember that scene where the see if you can find that scene. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2295.54s)]
*  I fucking love that scene. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2298.54s)]
*  That's a good scene. God damn. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2300.02s)]
*  That was good when that big UFO just showed up [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2301.6600000000003s)]
*  and it was near Devil's Tower and took people aboard. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2304.46s)]
*  Aliens got out the mothership. That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2307.9s)]
*  So when we started, that's how far look at that. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2311.98s)]
*  Oh, give me some volume because it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2318.18s)]
*  Give her six quivers, then pause. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2336.06s)]
*  She sends four quivers, a group of five quivers, a group of four semi quivers. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2339.8199999999997s)]
*  This is such a good movie. Yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2348.18s)]
*  We're communicating with UFOs through sound. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2356.8999999999996s)]
*  We have in common. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2359.8599999999997s)]
*  I hope somebody's taken all this down. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2361.46s)]
*  What are we saying to each other? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2363.2599999999998s)]
*  Seems they're trying to teach us a basic tonal vocabulary. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2365.1s)]
*  It's the first day of school, fellas. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2368.14s)]
*  Take everything from the light to all of her patterns. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2377.46s)]
*  Why would they play the tuba, though? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2383.8999999999996s)]
*  If you're an alien, it would I think if they were to make that movie today, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2385.8599999999997s)]
*  it would be like very synthetic sounds like EDM or something. Yeah, for sure. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2388.8199999999997s)]
*  It would be like trumpets. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2393.98s)]
*  Back then, they never predicted EDM. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2394.98s)]
*  The closest they had was disco. Yeah. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2397.14s)]
*  It was kind of EDM ish. Yeah. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2399.3399999999997s)]
*  But better. That fucking movie was definitely sound like Skrillex. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2401.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2405.1s)]
*  They have like keyboards and piano. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2406.54s)]
*  I wonder why they decided to do it this way, to have language [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2408.42s)]
*  be communicated through music and lights. Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2412.5s)]
*  That's the 70s. It's the 70s, man. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2416.3399999999997s)]
*  They didn't know any better. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2418.5s)]
*  Isn't it funny that even in today's science fiction movies, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2421.38s)]
*  no one's on their phone? Yeah. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2425.14s)]
*  I there's a article I read about that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2428.06s)]
*  I wonder if it's true. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2430.62s)]
*  They said it's not interesting to watch people on their phones, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2431.7799999999997s)]
*  definitely not. But it's also not realistic to not have people on their phones. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2434.6200000000003s)]
*  I think it's a movie or is it not a movie? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2438.0600000000004s)]
*  It's true. Only TV shows people are on their phones. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2440.7000000000003s)]
*  I just rewatched Top Gun the other day. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2444.1000000000004s)]
*  Have you seen the original Top Gun in a while? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2445.98s)]
*  That doesn't really hold up very well, man. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2448.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a part where he's hitting on a girl [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2450.94s)]
*  and then he finds out that the girl is with her husband or wife [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2453.1000000000004s)]
*  or boyfriend or something like that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2456.3s)]
*  And so then she he just starts watching her and she goes to the bathroom [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2458.2200000000003s)]
*  and he falls into the bathroom and starts talking about how he wants to fuck her [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2461.7s)]
*  on the sink. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2465.7s)]
*  And it's just like, how creepy Tom Cruise is just going into women's restrooms [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2466.4199999999996s)]
*  and then talking about fucking her on a sink and shit. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2470.62s)]
*  Wow. Like it was weird. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2472.66s)]
*  I was one of those movies, my girlfriend's so young, she hasn't seen seven. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2474.8999999999996s)]
*  Like, oh, you got to see Top Gun. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2477.7799999999997s)]
*  And halfway through, she's like, this is the cheesiest movie I've ever seen in my life. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2479.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, it is. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2482.58s)]
*  Those are the cocaine days. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2484.06s)]
*  They were doing cocaine and writing. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2485.98s)]
*  You know, that's like the showgirls days. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2489.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2491.22s)]
*  Showgirls is the best cocaine movie of all time. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2492.2999999999997s)]
*  She's with her husband or stuff. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2495.22s)]
*  He's like, oh, he's drinking his Bud Light, by the way. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2496.4599999999996s)]
*  He's a regular Bud Wise. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2499.4199999999996s)]
*  Drink light. Oh, oh. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2501.02s)]

*  It's too long. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2516.8599999999997s)]
*  What do you want to do? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2518.98s)]
*  Could you just drop right down on the tile and go for it? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2519.66s)]
*  Actually, I have this counter in mind. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2523.3799999999997s)]
*  Great. That would be very, very comfortable, yeah? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2528.02s)]
*  It could be. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2530.3799999999997s)]

*  He just met her two minutes before this. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2556.94s)]
*  This is so weird. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2560.22s)]
*  It's so weird that she's like, get the fuck out of here, you creep. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2562.42s)]
*  And then other women aren't in there shitting. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2566.5s)]

*  What kind of writing is this? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2572.54s)]
*  And she went into the bathroom just to like, like look at her lip or something. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2574.06s)]
*  She didn't even do anything in the bathroom, if you notice. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2578.18s)]
*  Just want to reapply makeup. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2580.14s)]
*  The writer's strike's happening right now, right? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2584.5s)]
*  So are all those late night talk shows fucked? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2586.5s)]
*  There's things like showing reruns and stuff, yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2588.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's hilarious. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2590.94s)]
*  They can't operate without writers. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2592.2599999999998s)]
*  I would just do the AI. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2595.3s)]
*  I'd be like... [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2596.58s)]
*  How about just interview people? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2597.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2599.06s)]
*  Just bring people in. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2600.14s)]

*  Did you see the South Park episode they did with that? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2602.3s)]
*  No. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2604.38s)]
*  I think they had Chat GPT write an episode. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2604.94s)]
*  Oh, they did? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2607.14s)]
*  At the end it says like, co-written by Trace Parker and Chat GPT. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2607.78s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2611.5400000000004s)]
*  It might have been a joke making a joke about the whole thing. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2611.94s)]
*  Or they might have actually used Chat GPT to write a monologue. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2614.1400000000003s)]
*  You can have Chat GPT write a monologue for Jimmy Fallon. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2618.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2621.6200000000003s)]
*  Come on. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2622.78s)]
*  That would be easy. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2623.94s)]
*  You should do... [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2626.5800000000004s)]
*  You should type in the Chat GPT, make a romantic story, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2628.02s)]
*  summary between Joe Rogan and Jamie. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2631.42s)]
*  That would be easy. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2634.7400000000002s)]
*  Do it, Jamie. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2635.7000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't know who I am. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2636.1800000000003s)]
*  I've tried. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2637.18s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2637.98s)]
*  It sort of... [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2638.42s)]
*  Yeah, it made up three people. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2639.46s)]
*  I asked who works on the show before. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2640.9s)]
*  It made up three names. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2642.74s)]
*  Michio Kaku had a very good point. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2644.02s)]
*  It's like it doesn't... [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2645.78s)]
*  It scours the entire internet. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2647.18s)]
*  So it's like people write nonsense and lies. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2648.98s)]
*  It scoops up those nonsense and lies and throws it in there too. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2652.34s)]
*  Like it can't discern, but it will be able to eventually, supposedly. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2655.2599999999998s)]
*  I heard that there's people that work behind the scenes on like Chat GPT [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2661.1s)]
*  and they're just like minimum wage, like McDonald's workers. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2664.14s)]
*  What? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2667.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2667.7799999999997s)]
*  There was an article that just came out yesterday about Chat GPT employees, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2668.14s)]
*  people to... [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2673.7799999999997s)]
*  I forget what they do, but they kind of like fact-checked or label the responses [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2675.18s)]
*  and they end up... [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2679.58s)]
*  They're only paying like $15 an hour or something. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2680.02s)]
*  I think this was... [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2682.5s)]
*  This might not be the same article, but I think this is how they were using it [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2684.22s)]
*  to program it maybe. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2686.46s)]
*  OpenAI used Kenyan workers for less than $2 per hour to make Chat GPT less toxic. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2687.7799999999997s)]
*  Less toxic. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2694.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2696.54s)]
*  There used to be a service a while ago, a long time ago. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2696.7799999999997s)]
*  I forget what it's called, but people... [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2699.1s)]
*  You would ask a question and people would do that. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2700.3399999999997s)]
*  They would answer for you and then respond sort of like Cha Cha or some shit like that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2702.42s)]
*  If there's... [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2706.14s)]
*  There's something super creepy about the fact that it's become totally normal [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2707.22s)]
*  for companies to use people in other countries that make almost no money [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2713.02s)]
*  to make things that they sell for thousands of dollars, like iPhones. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2718.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2722.06s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2722.74s)]
*  It's so weird that no one has shifted to manufacturing something like an iPhone in America. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2724.42s)]
*  No one has shifted to manufacturing. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2730.7s)]
*  All these things you see, these fucking creepy places where they're digging minerals out of the ground [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2733.02s)]
*  to make your phone, like... [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2739.42s)]
*  One... [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2742.18s)]
*  Just one company. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2742.62s)]
*  One company. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2743.94s)]
*  Make everything here. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2744.58s)]
*  Pay everybody well. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2745.7799999999997s)]
*  Make everything... [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2746.86s)]
*  Make me not feel like shit for buying a phone. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2747.3399999999997s)]
*  I've tried to like find... [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2750.58s)]
*  Is there a phone you can buy that's the most ethical? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2751.94s)]
*  Ethical phone? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2754.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2754.9s)]
*  Not really. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2755.7799999999997s)]
*  Not unless you want a fucking cord plugged into the wall. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2757.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2759.42s)]
*  What's the most ethical phone? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2761.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2764.86s)]
*  There used to be that one... [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2765.74s)]
*  Isn't there the Fairphone? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2766.38s)]
*  Is that like one? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2767.54s)]
*  There used to be that one. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2768.62s)]
*  Why do they whack though? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2769.5s)]
*  The problem is they can't compete. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2770.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2772.38s)]
*  You also have to use the Android. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2772.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2774.42s)]
*  I'll never use an iPhone. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2775.42s)]
*  Is there anybody that's more in a cult than the Android people? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2777.7799999999997s)]
*  Talking to Brian Simpson, I would have to agree with that. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2781.2599999999998s)]
*  Brian Simpson's ready to switch. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2783.66s)]
*  Oh, is he? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2785.06s)]
*  I work on him sometimes. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2785.74s)]
*  Oh, you work on him? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2786.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2787.2599999999998s)]
*  I work on him. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2789.22s)]
*  Just get him an Apple Watch and see what happens. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2789.8199999999997s)]
*  I do it 100% just to fuck with him. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2791.42s)]
*  I'm like, come on, bro. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2795.06s)]
*  Come over here, blue. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2796.22s)]
*  You don't want to send green text anymore. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2798.02s)]
*  He's like, well, when they come up with a USB-C, maybe I'll do it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2800.62s)]
*  But I wouldn't have to change all my chargers. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2803.14s)]
*  Like, oh yeah, that's the time. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2804.7s)]
*  That's the time. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2806.7s)]
*  You'll never go back. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2807.5s)]
*  I'm like, once you airdrop someone a video in like five seconds [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2808.7799999999997s)]
*  and you realize like, oh, this is like perfect resolution. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2812.78s)]
*  It went through Bluetooth. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2815.46s)]
*  I don't even have to have Wi-Fi on. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2816.54s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2818.7400000000002s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2819.54s)]
*  Bluetooth airdrop is the shit. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2820.7400000000002s)]
*  And the fact that they can't share back and forth with Android, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2823.86s)]
*  that alone keeps me from, you know, I mean, how many times do we take photos [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2827.06s)]
*  and just airdrop into each other? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2832.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2833.62s)]
*  It's airdrops amazing. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2833.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2835.3s)]
*  I use it all the time to do it to my computer. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2836.5s)]
*  Oh, they just announced yesterday that they're bringing Final Cut Pro [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2838.82s)]
*  and Logic to the iPad, which is insane. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2843.42s)]
*  Like you could edit ProRes video on an iPad now. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2847.1s)]
*  Well, the processing power is so good now. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2851.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2853.06s)]
*  It's crazy that that thin little thing has amazing battery life. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2853.38s)]
*  Crazy processing power. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2857.94s)]
*  Final Cut Pro on an iPad. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2860.1s)]
*  But the bad thing is I think about like, you know, when I edit Kill Tony [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2863.5s)]
*  and, you know, all that stuff, there's no way that that has enough storage [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2867.1s)]
*  space on that iPad to do all that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2871.18s)]
*  Don't they have a terabyte? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2872.98s)]
*  Yeah, a terabyte. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2874.62s)]
*  I guess one's two, maybe. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2875.58s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2877.94s)]
*  And I don't know if you can plug if plugging a hard drive in works [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2878.94s)]
*  the way it should on a like a laptop. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2882.02s)]
*  Just put it all in the cloud, Brian. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2883.42s)]
*  No. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2885.1s)]
*  Put everything in the cloud. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2885.86s)]
*  We'll take care of you up here. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2887.22s)]
*  Come on. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2889.7s)]
*  All you dick pics up here in the cloud. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2890.98s)]
*  No, instead, I have a closet of hundreds of hard drives. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2893.94s)]
*  Remember when we used to take them to the range and shoot them? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2897.26s)]
*  Yeah, that was fun. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2899.14s)]
*  That was a lot of fun. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2900.94s)]
*  I need to do that again. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2901.82s)]
*  I still need to get a gun. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2902.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going tomorrow. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2904.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2905.26s)]
*  Go to the range. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2905.6600000000003s)]
*  Let's go shoot guns. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2906.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2907.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2909.38s)]
*  What kind of gun you want? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2909.94s)]
*  I'll get you a gun. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2910.6600000000003s)]
*  I was thinking a Glock like 17 or Glock 19 or something. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2911.62s)]
*  Fucking John Wick gun. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2916.62s)]
*  What's the John Wick gun? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2917.94s)]
*  You got to see a badass gun. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=2918.82s)]

*  You have to get your car inspected every year, even if it's brand new, even if it's [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3178.1s)]
*  electric. There's all these extra things. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3181.86s)]

*  And finally I get down to the eye exam test. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3187.26s)]
*  He's like, all right, read the bottom line. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3190.42s)]
*  And I couldn't fucking read it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3192.54s)]
*  I said like, he goes, there's no numbers in this. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3193.94s)]
*  And I'm like, oh shit. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3196.34s)]

*  And he goes, do you have glasses? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3201.7000000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I have glasses at home, but they're not that powerful. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3202.78s)]
*  And he goes, you have to go home and get them. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3205.1400000000003s)]
*  So he made me drive all the way home, like 30 minutes and come all the way back. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3206.34s)]
*  And then I put on the glasses and this other guy takes out this other piece of paper [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3209.58s)]
*  and doesn't make me read the bottom, makes me read the middle. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3213.22s)]
*  And he goes, I'm like, oh, I just have to read middle. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3215.3799999999997s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. And I passed immediately. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3217.18s)]
*  And I was like, wait, why did this guy make me read like the very bottom from like [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3219.2599999999998s)]

*  He's mad at you. Yeah, maybe. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3225.8199999999997s)]

*  It's weird how much more free you are with other stuff, though. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3244.42s)]
*  Like even in the city of Austin, like getting the club open was a breeze. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3248.5s)]

*  You know, it's like the it's like the store's back bar on steroids. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3460.62s)]
*  And then when everybody goes down there and the music is awesome and everybody's [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3465.26s)]
*  happy, just such a great environment. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3468.14s)]
*  Man, you guys have one of the best staffs. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3470.9s)]
*  Also, there's not like one bad staff member. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3473.42s)]
*  Everyone's pretty just solid. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3475.34s)]
*  No, they're great. They're well, because we brought so many people from the store [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3477.3s)]
*  and then Carrie just took care of all, you know, she just knows how to handle stuff. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3481.26s)]
*  Yeah, she's the best. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3484.82s)]
*  It's just fuck. It's amazing. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3486.42s)]
*  It just it feels like a dream. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3488.54s)]
*  Like why are you there? Like, how is this real? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3490.66s)]
*  How did we do it? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3492.94s)]
*  And especially for us, because we talked about doing it for like two fucking years. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3494.26s)]
*  You know, it's like for two years, everybody was like mocking us. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3499.2200000000003s)]
*  When's your club open? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3502.98s)]
*  And I'm like, it takes time. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3504.18s)]
*  Takes time. OK, so that fucking easy. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3506.26s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3510.2200000000003s)]
*  And you've done so much to that place, though. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3511.54s)]
*  There was a lot of construction. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3514.46s)]
*  You lowering the lowering the ceiling, I heard, took an extra two months just for that. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3515.98s)]
*  You know, it was some time. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3520.14s)]
*  Well, that was after Louie came by. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3521.42s)]
*  Yeah, Louie came by and he gave me some really good pointers, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3522.98s)]
*  a really good piece of advice. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3528.38s)]
*  I should just say direction, because I just did everything he said. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3531.02s)]
*  You know, he's like, this stage is too big. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3533.9s)]
*  She makes the stage smaller. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3535.3s)]
*  I was like, you're right. Why is it so big? Yeah, it's good. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3536.26s)]
*  So this is like while construction was going on, they had to cut into the bar, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3538.5s)]
*  the rebar and said, OK, we're going to make this two feet shorter on each. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3541.94s)]
*  I think made four feet shorter on each side of the stage. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3545.58s)]
*  Yeah. The little boy, the little room. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3548.38s)]
*  And so then he said in the ceiling, the ceiling was already low in the little room. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3551.3s)]
*  It's like lower it even more because all the ceilings, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3555.5800000000004s)]
*  the way the Alamo draft house was, it was a movie theater. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3558.2200000000003s)]
*  So it was set up like a movie theater. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3561.34s)]
*  It's like stage, you know, like concert stadium seating. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3562.78s)]
*  And so what we did is we lifted the floor up in both rooms. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3565.9s)]
*  So it was no it's flat now, flat across. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3570.38s)]
*  And then we'd lower the ceiling as well. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3574.1400000000003s)]
*  So we just made it just cozy. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3576.1800000000003s)]
*  Best sound system ever. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3578.6600000000003s)]
*  It's perfect. So amazing. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3580.3799999999997s)]
*  It's perfect. And it's like one of those things where when comics experience it, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3581.98s)]
*  they realize like, oh, this is the optimum environment for doing the art, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3586.98s)]
*  for being around the comics, having fun, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3592.3799999999997s)]
*  all fucking around together and having a really good time. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3595.8999999999996s)]
*  And the audience has a great time. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3599.2599999999998s)]
*  It's magic. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3601.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like everything I could have ever hoped it would be. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3603.3399999999997s)]
*  Really is. And I'm glad that you're right next door, too. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3605.9399999999996s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3609.26s)]
*  It's awesome to have so many clothes, like even people that are staff there. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3610.26s)]
*  They're like those those folks that work the door. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3614.3s)]
*  Those those folks are all standups. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3617.02s)]
*  So if they have a spot like at the Creek in the Cave and like nine thirty, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3619.1s)]
*  they can punch out and go do their spot and then come back and punch back in. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3623.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And that's it's amazing because like, you know, I did a secret show [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3628.3s)]
*  and half your staff is on the show when they're wearing their comedy. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3631.54s)]
*  My like everyone's wearing the same staff shirts, you know. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3634.78s)]
*  And that's a good thing because that's that would never that's never heard of [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3638.38s)]
*  of any comedy club like in L.A. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3642.2200000000003s)]
*  They would never let you like clock out at the Laugh Factory to go do a spot [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3643.82s)]
*  at the Improv. Are you kidding me? You know, that would never happen. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3647.58s)]
*  So that's what there almost needs to be a position that all the clubs pay for. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3650.46s)]
*  Like a yoni or somebody that goes in between each one and goes, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3654.34s)]
*  hurry, you have three minutes to go back to work. Right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3656.98s)]
*  Well, it's we were trying to set it up for new talent, too. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3661.78s)]
*  Like the big thing that, you know, Burr and I actually talked about this [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3666.06s)]
*  is like the big mistake that a lot of these big clubs did is they stopped [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3669.7400000000002s)]
*  doing open mics because you don't you don't ever develop any local talent. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3672.58s)]
*  You got to like bite the bullet on those nights [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3676.42s)]
*  and you got to have two nights of amateurs. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3678.46s)]
*  I think two nights is the way to do it, because that's how the store did it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3681.38s)]
*  And I think, you know, the development process here [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3684.7000000000003s)]
*  is probably going to be more accelerated because you have more opportunities [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3689.14s)]
*  for sets or sets all around town, the sets all around that block. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3693.26s)]
*  And you're going to get to see like top flight comics who come into town, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3697.38s)]
*  which is big for like young comics to see good comics. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3702.0200000000004s)]
*  It's very important for me, like growing up in Boston, especially [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3705.38s)]
*  starting out there, was so lucky to be able to see the guys that are already [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3709.94s)]
*  like really good because if you're in a spot like, you know, some city [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3713.98s)]
*  where there's not that much common, you start your own open mic night like who you [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3718.5400000000004s)]
*  who are you working with? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3722.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, right. There's no one there. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3723.9s)]
*  It's like it's hard to develop it unless there's other [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3725.7s)]
*  like comics to sort of compare to and watch. Absolutely. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3729.3799999999997s)]
*  And that doesn't happen in a lot of these corporate clubs in cities [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3733.5s)]
*  where they just have like, you know, a wacky comedy club. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3736.46s)]
*  You know, you can't just hang out there. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3739.42s)]
*  You know, like they won't let you just hang out there as a young comic and watch. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3741.06s)]
*  Also, people kind of know what you're doing. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3744.22s)]
*  You know, they'll come in if Shane Gillis is in town. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3746.46s)]
*  They'll come in if Rich Voss is in town. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3748.8199999999997s)]
*  They'll come in and pay, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3750.54s)]
*  but they're not going to be there all the time. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3752.9s)]
*  You know, it's like. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3754.86s)]
*  But to set it up the way that we set it up, who the fuck's going to do that? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3757.94s)]
*  Yeah, nobody's going to do that. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3761.38s)]
*  We also at Sunset that we have open mics on the day of Kill Tony [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3763.82s)]
*  will have before Kill Tony starts, we'll have one minute mics [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3769.02s)]
*  so people can go in there and, you know, just try a minute real quick [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3772.5s)]
*  before they go sign up for Kill Tony. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3775.34s)]
*  That's good, because if you do get a chance to do Kill Tony, you already warmed it up. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3777.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3781.58s)]
*  And to test out the timing to a lot of people think a minute, you know. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3783.1s)]
*  Well, you have a good place to have a big comic wants to come to because you have 500 seats. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3786.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we can go up pretty pretty high in that place right now. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3790.54s)]
*  We only have it like at 200, 300 if we need to. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3794.02s)]
*  But also you have like modular. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3797.94s)]
*  Yeah, we have it. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3799.46s)]
*  So they take the seats out and make it how many ever tickets are. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3800.1s)]
*  So, you know, make it a little bit more intimate and stuff. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3803.54s)]
*  That's good. Spread it out. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3806.58s)]
*  It's a good space, though. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3807.94s)]
*  It's a good space for stand up. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3809.22s)]
*  There's a speakeasy right below it, which is so weird. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3811.2999999999997s)]
*  There's this light in the alley. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3815.02s)]
*  And if the lights on, that means it's open. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3816.46s)]
*  And if you go down our back stairs, you'll just see this door. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3818.66s)]
*  And it's like, what's in that door? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3822.62s)]
*  You open that door and it's just this underground bar that looks like it's in the 80s [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3824.1s)]
*  and it's really trippy. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3828.7s)]
*  And it's so interesting that there's. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3830.7s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's pretty decent. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3832.58s)]
*  It's about the size of like a, you know, like a subway sandwich place or something. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3835.46s)]
*  You know, it's like, yeah, it's interesting, though. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3838.86s)]
*  There's the speakeasy business in this town is very interesting. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3841.78s)]
*  There's a lot of secret bars. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3845.14s)]
*  Yeah. How does that work? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3846.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like they're private clubs so they can get away and stay in openly. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3848.18s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3851.34s)]
*  There's one down the street from us called like VCR repair or something like that. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3852.54s)]
*  You know, I'm talking floppy disk repair. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3856.18s)]
*  And it looks like a computer store or something like floppy disk repair. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3858.38s)]
*  They get the code to get in every day. They change it. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3861.9s)]
*  Yeah. Really? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3863.94s)]
*  I go into a different bar. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3865.1000000000004s)]
*  I think it's like the garage bar, which is in a parking garage. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3866.26s)]
*  It's like, what's good? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3868.6600000000003s)]
*  Why is there a bar in the middle of this fucking parking? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3870.0600000000004s)]
*  Whatever. And you go inside and like, hey, what's the code to the other bar? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3872.38s)]
*  Like, they might tell you they might not. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3875.3s)]
*  There's another way to get it to. I read. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3877.7000000000003s)]
*  But like, I don't I've never been. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3878.94s)]
*  What's in the floppy disk bar? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3880.34s)]
*  Oh, show the picture of it if you can. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3882.02s)]
*  I've never been inside of it because I always thought it was like, what is going on here? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3883.7400000000002s)]
*  This is like a rug store in Glendale. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3887.1800000000003s)]
*  This is a money front. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3888.78s)]
*  Like, who's going to get floppy disk repair? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3890.3s)]
*  A rug store in Glendale. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3892.86s)]
*  That's the outside. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3894.38s)]
*  Like, look at that. It's like, what? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3895.02s)]
*  That's a bar. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3896.94s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3897.9s)]
*  There's the secret door kind of thing. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3898.86s)]
*  Huh. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3900.5s)]
*  That's a bar. It's like swings. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3901.46s)]
*  And so it's just a bar with. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3903.18s)]
*  Special weird drinks. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3904.5s)]
*  Hmm. OK. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3905.7799999999997s)]
*  I can't really. There's not a lot of pictures of that. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3907.2999999999997s)]
*  All righty. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3908.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of those in Austin, though. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3911.06s)]
*  It's weird. It's fun down there. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3912.62s)]
*  Yeah. There you go. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3913.86s)]
*  A lot of secrets. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3914.86s)]
*  Like swings as the seats. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3916.18s)]
*  You've done that. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3917.7799999999997s)]
*  What is that? Spider ballroom? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3919.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Spider ballroom. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3921.54s)]
*  They do stand up there sometimes? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3923.02s)]
*  Yeah. They do a lot of shows there. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3924.98s)]
*  That's a nice little stage. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3926.74s)]
*  That's a dope looking room. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3928.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3929.7s)]
*  They sold. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3930.3s)]
*  I think the owner sold it to a new owner. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3931.94s)]
*  And so it's not the exact same as it used to be. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3934.46s)]
*  It used to have a lot more charm. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3936.5s)]
*  Like, there was an old piano outside that had been weathered down by weather. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3938.58s)]
*  And they used to have this really cool courtyard with all this really cool stuff. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3942.62s)]
*  And it looks like somebody just kind of cleaned it up now. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3945.66s)]
*  So it's still pretty cool, though. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3948.02s)]
*  Have you done the Velveeta yet? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3950.98s)]
*  No. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3952.82s)]
*  Velveeta's across the street from Vulcan, kind of. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3953.3s)]
*  Ron said there's another room across the street, too, called the Green Room. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3956.1800000000003s)]
*  He said it's like 70 seats. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3959.46s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even hear that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3961.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3962.42s)]
*  I've been going there for 20 years. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3963.3s)]
*  What? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3964.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3966.26s)]
*  So there's apparently another spot there, too. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3967.1400000000003s)]
*  All those... [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3969.34s)]
*  Ask the locals. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3970.26s)]
*  There's all sorts of mics that are going on all over the fucking place. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3971.98s)]
*  Yeah, I showed you pictures of that Alamo I did the other day. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3975.2200000000003s)]
*  It was like being in a circus. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3977.3s)]
*  It was the coolest room ever. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3978.82s)]
*  I think Richard did those, too. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3980.5400000000004s)]
*  The guy who did our place, we got the same architect who did the remodel for the Alamo Drafthouse. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3982.38s)]
*  So the same guy that did the Close Encounters thing, that beautiful thing. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3988.54s)]
*  All these Alamos are all themes. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3992.98s)]
*  And they all have different themes, like the theme from The Shining. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3995.02s)]
*  You know when there's the one where it's the carpet with the big wheel in the middle of it? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=3998.1400000000003s)]
*  He did all those. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4002.42s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4003.3s)]
*  Kind of like fries. Remember fries? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4004.3s)]
*  Exactly like fries. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4006.1s)]
*  He also did... [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4008.34s)]
*  The RZA has a bar in Staten Island called the Flying Guillotine. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4009.82s)]
*  And it's like a Kung Fu themed bar. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4015.1400000000003s)]
*  Because you know, Wu Tangs, they're all in the Kung Fu. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4021.02s)]
*  So it's all like... [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4024.34s)]
*  And that's why it's called the Flying Guillotine, because I think the Flying Guillotine was a Kung Fu movie. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4025.78s)]
*  Have you been to that Wu Tang inspired restaurant here in Austin? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4031.1400000000003s)]
*  No. What is it? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4034.94s)]
*  You know what it's called, Jamie? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4036.82s)]
*  Danny Brown took me to it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4038.86s)]
*  And it's something Wu Tang... [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4040.0600000000004s)]
*  It's a restaurant and like everything's... [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4042.34s)]
*  They only play Wu Tang the whole time you're there and stuff, but it's like a Chinese restaurant. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4044.98s)]
*  Wuchao? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4049.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4050.26s)]
*  Wuchao? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4050.94s)]
*  Wuchao. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4051.46s)]
*  Wuchao's not Wu Tang inspired, is it? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4051.94s)]
*  That's what Danny Brown told me. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4053.46s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4054.94s)]
*  Danny Brown's one of those? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4055.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because they play Wu Tang the whole time. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4056.86s)]
*  They play all kinds of music there. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4058.82s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4060.34s)]
*  On Danny Brown's truck. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4061.02s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he was. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4062.42s)]
*  Maybe I misheard him. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4064.0600000000004s)]
*  But that was a while ago. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4064.82s)]
*  But yeah, he took me there. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4067.54s)]
*  That place is cool. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4069.1000000000004s)]
*  I like the food there. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4069.9s)]
*  Yeah, Wuchao's great. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4070.42s)]
*  That's TK's place. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4071.46s)]
*  TK is... [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4073.2200000000003s)]
*  He also owns that Omakase Sushi place. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4074.38s)]
*  Toshikan? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4078.9s)]
*  Have you been there? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4080.7000000000003s)]
*  No. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4081.46s)]
*  Oh my God, it's amazing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4081.82s)]
*  There's some good spots. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4083.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, maybe if TK was there and they were playing Wu Tang. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4084.82s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4087.6600000000003s)]
*  Because last time I was there, they were playing all kinds of music. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4088.94s)]
*  But the Chinese food here is legit too. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4091.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4093.42s)]
*  Have you eaten at Lin? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4094.18s)]
*  No. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4096.0199999999995s)]
*  Lin is legit. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4096.46s)]
*  Lin, I think she started at Wuchao and then left and started her own place. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4097.46s)]
*  Where's it at? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4101.139999999999s)]
*  It's off 6th. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4102.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4105.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm up there, man. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4107.34s)]
*  I'm up north, so I haven't gone to a lot of stuff. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4108.22s)]
*  You're out where you hear gunshots at night. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4110.86s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4113.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a bobcat that lives in my backyard. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4114.94s)]
*  Coyotes don't howl in here's neck of the woods. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4118.22s)]
*  They get shot. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4120.3s)]
*  Side tracked. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4121.42s)]
*  Old video I saw, but maybe it's new. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4121.98s)]
*  There's a family walking through the jungle, I guess, in a mountain line or [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4124.179999999999s)]
*  Jaguar or whatever. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4128.78s)]
*  It pops up right next to them. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4129.5s)]
*  Little kids, two little kids, a guide, mom. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4131.0599999999995s)]

*  I bet they're dangerous. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4415.26s)]
*  I bet they fuck people up every year. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4416.14s)]
*  It depends how they're raised, I guess, right? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4417.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4419.7s)]
*  They don't. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4420.34s)]
*  OK, the strength is much higher than that of a normal cat. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4420.860000000001s)]
*  And even if they don't mean harm, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4423.58s)]
*  they can cause it simply by playing. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4424.9400000000005s)]

*  but they don't want to injure each other. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4646.74s)]
*  They don't want to get injured, so they're reluctant to engage. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4649.42s)]
*  So they're standing in front of each other going, wah! [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4652.74s)]
*  Oh, awesome. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4656.82s)]
*  Look at their faces. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4659.78s)]
*  Someone put captions on it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4666.74s)]
*  This is why she doesn't like you. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4673.38s)]
*  How weird. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4677.179999999999s)]
*  It is weird. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4678.179999999999s)]

*  Woo! [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4679.54s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4682.0199999999995s)]
*  It's interesting how they both are in agreement [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4685.5s)]
*  that they're not really going to touch each other. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4687.66s)]
*  Almost. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4691.06s)]

*  It looks like he has really big feet. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4693.94s)]
*  Oh, they do have big feet, man, because they run in snow. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4695.82s)]
*  They're cold weather cats. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4699.06s)]
*  It is interesting when cats live in cold weather like that. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4701.98s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4705.98s)]
*  It sounds like two little kids walking around in the backyard. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4710.54s)]
*  It's interesting how they both know not to get after it, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4715.74s)]
*  because they can get fucking hurt. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4719.94s)]
*  So they're just bluffing, even though they're standing [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4722.1s)]
*  right in front of each other. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4725.18s)]
*  You ever see a snow leopard? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4726.58s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4728.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's another cold weather cat. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4728.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4730.62s)]
*  You always think of cats as like a jungle creature. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4731.14s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of cold weather cats. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4734.22s)]
*  Siberian tigers, big furry ass tiger. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4736.14s)]
*  That's what everybody ran from for most of human history, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4742.18s)]
*  just running away from big cats. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4745.58s)]
*  That's the cleanup crew of nature. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4748.22s)]
*  Anybody with a limp? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4750.46s)]
*  Anybody that can't figure out a spear? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4753.14s)]
*  Anybody doesn't know how to get to the top of the tree? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4755.26s)]
*  That's a wrap. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4757.5s)]
*  Have you been watching Chimp Empire? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4758.780000000001s)]
*  No, what's that? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4761.34s)]
*  It's really good, man. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4762.26s)]
*  Chimp Empire. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4763.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a documentary series that's on Netflix [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4764.0599999999995s)]
*  about these chimpanzees. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4768.219999999999s)]
*  And these folks got embedded with these chimpanzees. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4770.339999999999s)]
*  The footage is fucking insane. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4774.219999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely insane. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4777.299999999999s)]
*  And these camera people are just accepted by these chimps, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4779.82s)]
*  because they've been there for so long. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4784.58s)]
*  The chimps just act normal around these camera people, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4786.379999999999s)]
*  and they get to see them. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4788.74s)]
*  Their social hierarchy, how they have wage war [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4790.139999999999s)]
*  with neighboring clans. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4793.42s)]
*  They control territory. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4794.78s)]
*  The territory that has fruit is run [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4797.1s)]
*  by this one group of chimps. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4799.02s)]
*  These other ones came in and killed the chimp. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4800.86s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4803.62s)]
*  Man, I want to watch this. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4804.66s)]
*  It's really intense. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4805.9s)]
*  When did this come out? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4806.86s)]
*  Just recently? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4807.62s)]
*  It's pretty recent, yeah. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4808.14s)]
*  It's really, really good, man. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4809.54s)]
*  And the footage is unprecedented. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4811.18s)]
*  They used drones. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4814.02s)]
*  They used camera people. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4815.38s)]
*  They did all kinds of stuff to get incredible tree top footage [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4817.3s)]
*  up there. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4823.1s)]
*  They kill a lot of monkeys. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4824.26s)]
*  A lot of monkeys. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4826.780000000001s)]
*  That's their favorite thing to do. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4828.700000000001s)]
*  They kill monkeys. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4830.18s)]
*  They eat them. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4830.900000000001s)]
*  And when you watch it happen over and over again, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4831.9800000000005s)]
*  you're like, oh, boy. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4834.660000000001s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4835.860000000001s)]
*  This little legless monkeys, they're just eating his guts. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4837.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, god. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4841.9400000000005s)]
*  I just had that happen to me two days ago. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4844.580000000001s)]
*  I have this toad I nicknamed him Jeff. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4847.14s)]
*  He just lives in my front yard, and he just [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4849.3s)]
*  sits underneath the light at night and waits for bugs to fall [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4851.02s)]
*  on the ground underneath the light. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4854.26s)]
*  And I came home the other night from mothership. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4856.14s)]
*  It was 2 in the morning. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4858.22s)]
*  I get dropped off. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4859.22s)]
*  And I walk into the front door, and there's [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4860.1s)]
*  a possum with half of him in his mouth with blood just [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4863.3s)]
*  splattering out everywhere. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4866.780000000001s)]
*  And I didn't know what it was. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4868.660000000001s)]
*  I was like, is that a rat? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4869.900000000001s)]
*  Wait, what's in his mouth? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4870.820000000001s)]
*  What's he eating? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4871.900000000001s)]
*  And I have all my rain camera, and the toad's just half missing, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4872.740000000001s)]
*  guts hanging out, still go up like frogging, and just blood, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4877.26s)]
*  so much blood everywhere, dude. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4882.820000000001s)]
*  And one of his legs has just been sucked off the bone, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4885.34s)]
*  just sitting there. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4889.860000000001s)]
*  One of the most corriest things I've ever seen in my life. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4891.06s)]
*  Possums are ruthless little fuckers. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4893.26s)]
*  Fuck them. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4895.1s)]
*  I hate possums now. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4895.740000000001s)]
*  They're weird. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4897.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4898.02s)]
*  They're like, if you see their mouth, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4898.54s)]
*  Marshall got one the other day. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4900.3s)]
*  That was actually a while ago. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4902.1s)]
*  He got one. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4903.22s)]
*  And I don't know if it was dead or just plain dead. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4903.900000000001s)]
*  He was like, ah. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4905.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4906.7s)]
*  You see them with their mouth open and their fucking teeth. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4907.62s)]
*  What a creepy-looking animal. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4910.1s)]
*  They are. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4911.9400000000005s)]
*  And what a weird defense mechanism. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4912.66s)]
*  It just plays dead. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4914.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4915.58s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4917.26s)]
*  It has some sort of a panic attack and can't move. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4918.34s)]
*  I told you, when we lived in Burbank, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4922.34s)]
*  Janice called me once when I was at the commie store. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4924.14s)]
*  She goes, there's a hurt possum. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4926.46s)]
*  I brought him in, and he's in a box, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4928.06s)]
*  and I have him wrapped up with a towel. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4929.66s)]
*  And I'm like, he's not hurt. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4931.26s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4932.66s)]
*  He's not hurt. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4933.14s)]
*  Get that possum out. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4934.14s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4935.14s)]
*  You got a possum in your house. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4935.9s)]
*  A crazy girlfriend that doesn't understand wildlife. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4937.62s)]
*  That bitch is going to get rabies. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4941.299999999999s)]
*  I was like, throw it out right now. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4943.86s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4945.7s)]
*  She was holding it like a baby. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4946.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4947.86s)]
*  It's hurt. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4949.259999999999s)]
*  Does she know what playing possum is? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4951.46s)]
*  No. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4953.179999999999s)]
*  She's never heard of that before? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4954.58s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4957.139999999999s)]
*  I have pictures somewhere. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4959.099999999999s)]
*  I will send them if I find them. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4960.099999999999s)]
*  Why do possums lock up like that? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4961.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4963.9s)]
*  Is there a reason for that? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4964.62s)]
*  Why do possums play dead? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4966.66s)]
*  Why do possums play possum? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4967.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4969.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I guess that is like, hey, I [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4970.62s)]
*  don't want to fight. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4971.94s)]
*  I'll just act like dead. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4972.54s)]
*  But then things just eat you. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4973.82s)]
*  They're going to eat you, I guess. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4975.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4975.98s)]
*  That is weird. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4976.7s)]
*  Unless something is just trying to neutralize you, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4977.38s)]
*  then you just pretend you're already neutralized. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4981.38s)]
*  It says it's an involuntary response to the system. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4983.9s)]
*  It's like, yeah, they'll distance. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4986.18s)]
*  It's only a defense mechanism, I guess. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4987.18s)]
*  Oh, it's like a feigning goat, then. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4988.74s)]
*  Involuntary defense mechanism that somehow [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4991.18s)]
*  imparts some sort of natural attack. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4995.5s)]
*  The predators don't want to eat someone who's already dead. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4997.62s)]
*  They want to kill it. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=4999.5s)]
*  Oh, so they just act dead. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5000.38s)]
*  It's like a numbers game. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5002.7s)]
*  Ugliest animal in the world. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5004.26s)]
*  Their fucking mouths. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5005.46s)]
*  Ugh. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5006.7s)]
*  Toad-eating monsters. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5008.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5009.46s)]
*  That's probably the only animal that when it's a baby, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5010.46s)]
*  it still doesn't look cute. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5013.06s)]
*  What a fucking creep. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5015.98s)]
*  Ew. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5016.98s)]
*  You got to have a thumb like a raccoon. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5018.14s)]
*  I'd take a raccoon any day over that. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5020.82s)]
*  I want to send you something, Jamie. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5023.98s)]
*  This is fucking... [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5026.0199999999995s)]
*  This guy had this photo of a wolf mouth on his Instagram. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5029.139999999999s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5033.299999999999s)]
*  Like, you don't realize what the inside [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5035.46s)]
*  of a wolf's mouth looks like. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5037.78s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5039.62s)]
*  How close up is it? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5045.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5046.219999999999s)]
*  Probably closer than that. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5047.0599999999995s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5048.219999999999s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5050.339999999999s)]
*  That looks like your statue. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5052.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5055.02s)]
*  It looks fake. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5055.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5056.7s)]
*  Well, their bones are designed to crush... [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5057.54s)]
*  I mean, their teeth, rather, are designed to crush bones. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5059.62s)]
*  Did you just send... [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5063.86s)]
*  No, I can't find it. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5064.78s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5065.62s)]
*  I'll find it later. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5066.46s)]
*  I'll send it to you. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5067.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5068.9800000000005s)]
*  Fuck them. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5069.82s)]
*  Fuck all those things. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5070.66s)]
*  That's one of the things about Texas. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5071.5s)]
*  Like, the coyotes don't howl out here as much. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5072.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5075.74s)]
*  Because they get shot. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5076.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5077.900000000001s)]
*  They figure it out. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5078.74s)]
*  It's still... [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5079.78s)]
*  I'm close to think... [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5080.7s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5081.54s)]
*  What? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5082.5s)]
*  It looks like a fake photo. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5083.34s)]
*  No, it's real. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5084.3s)]
*  No, no, I know, but I've seen so many mid-journey [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5085.14s)]
*  and fake AI photos. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5087.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, it's all starting to look like it's not real. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5088.38s)]
*  No, there's a series of photos of that wolf. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5090.78s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5094.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5095.7s)]
*  Yeah, the AI stuff, not being able to know [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5098.74s)]
*  if something's real or not. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5101.14s)]
*  Like, Alex Jones was just on the news yesterday [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5102.46s)]
*  about being trolled by AI, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5105.34s)]
*  and he's like some guy from Canada. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5107.66s)]
*  Yeah, someone called him with someone else's voice. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5110.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5113.34s)]
*  It was like Tucker Carlson or something like that. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5114.18s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty funny. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5115.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's the world we live in now, dude. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5116.66s)]
*  You're not gonna be able to tell. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5118.42s)]
*  Within a year, there's no notice. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5119.58s)]
*  I mean, who knows what's real, what's not. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5123.58s)]
*  You're gonna be getting news stories that are fake, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5125.98s)]
*  and they look completely real, like attacks. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5127.94s)]
*  I mean, the ability to pull off a false flag attack now [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5130.66s)]
*  and things along those lines, like, you just fake them. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5134.0599999999995s)]
*  It's whack the dog. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5137.06s)]
*  I mean, they're gonna be able to do, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5138.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, within a year, every person [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5141.38s)]
*  that has ever recorded anything, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5144.26s)]
*  they'll be able to get your voice and have you say anything. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5145.900000000001s)]
*  Like, they have people calling up their parents, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5148.580000000001s)]
*  and it's a fake kid. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5151.46s)]
*  It's already happening. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5152.620000000001s)]
*  And saying he's getting kidnapped. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5153.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5154.3s)]
*  Scary shit. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5155.120000000001s)]
*  Now, was that real? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5155.96s)]
*  Because I heard that also, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5156.780000000001s)]
*  there was like a Facebook post about it, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5157.620000000001s)]
*  like watch out for this new scam, they have AI, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5159.18s)]
*  and there was a story about somebody [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5163.620000000001s)]
*  thinking it was their mom or something [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5165.7s)]
*  and getting a loan out. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5167.78s)]
*  I've heard of this happening way beyond the AI stuff, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5169.78s)]
*  which I find weird that it's, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5172.78s)]
*  because now it seems very capable of going on, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5174.38s)]
*  but I definitely have heard this as a Facebook post story [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5176.26s)]
*  going around for a few years. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5178.22s)]
*  Like, a grandparent was called in a ransom thing, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5179.3s)]
*  and they just paid it without calling. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5181.58s)]
*  I was like, how did they do that then? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5182.9s)]
*  No idea. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5184.58s)]
*  But they didn't have to do it with a fake voice back then. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5186.58s)]
*  The claim was that it sounded like the grandchild [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5190.099999999999s)]
*  or whatever, and how were they doing that [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5193.46s)]
*  is beyond me five years ago. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5196.32s)]
*  Now it seems very easy to do, obviously. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5197.719999999999s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5200.16s)]
*  I don't know of a firsthand account. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5201.0s)]
*  I've talked to someone like this happened to me. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5202.5199999999995s)]
*  I've seen a lot of videos of people saying [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5203.839999999999s)]
*  this happened to me, they used my voice. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5205.799999999999s)]
*  So I've told my parents, I'm like, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5208.16s)]
*  hey, don't leave anything you hear anymore. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5209.12s)]
*  Call me first. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5211.32s)]
*  Code word. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5212.16s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5213.0s)]
*  This is wild, you have to send out a preemptive strike. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5214.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5217.5199999999995s)]
*  If you get anything, don't believe it, call me first. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5218.36s)]
*  I'm reminding my mom every week just in case she forgets. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5220.32s)]
*  It's all fake. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5222.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5224.46s)]
*  Just remember it's all fake. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5225.3s)]
*  Yeah, we're real close to not having any idea what's real. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5226.62s)]
*  And then with AI, the fact that AI is going to be able [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5232.98s)]
*  to answer any kind of question, but it's also programmed. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5237.34s)]
*  So AI is very woke. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5240.18s)]
*  Like if you ask AI, one of the things that's said, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5243.94s)]
*  is it okay, like should I be proud to be white? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5246.34s)]
*  If you say that. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5249.86s)]
*  If you ask AI, it's like, well, you don't have any control [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5251.26s)]
*  over that, should I be proud to be black? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5255.26s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5256.780000000001s)]
*  It's one of those deals. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5259.54s)]
*  It's like, say something positive about Donald Trump, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5261.38s)]
*  it won't. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5264.74s)]
*  Say something positive about Joe Biden, it will. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5265.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucked up. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5267.780000000001s)]
*  Well, that's also, it seems like human controlling. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5269.900000000001s)]
*  This is something cool I saw yesterday, I think. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5272.5s)]
*  Meta is open sourced a tool they have, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5275.3s)]
*  and here's an explanation of what it does. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5277.74s)]
*  So be careful for videos like this. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5279.82s)]
*  Check this out. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5281.62s)]
*  Most AI models only work across one or two modes, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5282.46s)]
*  but our new image bind model works across six, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5285.98s)]
*  text, audio, images and video, 3D, thermal and motion data. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5289.0199999999995s)]
*  You give it input in one form [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5293.78s)]
*  and it can relate it to any others. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5295.299999999999s)]
*  It works more like our own imagination. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5297.66s)]
*  If you give it a picture of a beach, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5300.66s)]
*  it can find the sound of waves. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5303.0199999999995s)]
*  If you give it a photo of a tiger [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5308.179999999999s)]
*  and the sound of a waterfall, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5310.5s)]
*  it can give you a video that combines both. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5314.5s)]
*  This is a step towards AIs [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5320.9s)]
*  that understand the world around them more like we do, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5322.62s)]
*  which will make them a lot more useful [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5325.62s)]
*  and will open up totally new ways to create things. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5327.7s)]
*  We're open sourcing image bind [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5332.42s)]
*  so everyone in the world can access [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5334.3s)]
*  and build on top of these state of the art models. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5336.18s)]
*  I'm excited to see what. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5338.74s)]
*  That guy has a tech guy voice like a strip club DJ. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5340.34s)]
*  He has a strip club DJ voice. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5344.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a tech guy voice. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5346.42s)]
*  I almost seem real, don't I? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5348.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5351.3s)]
*  Is he imitating Steve Jobs [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5352.139999999999s)]
*  because the jobs sort of have that deal. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5353.219999999999s)]
*  More like Zuckerberg. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5354.0599999999995s)]
*  Sounds more like Zuckerberg. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5355.0599999999995s)]
*  That is Zuckerberg. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5355.9s)]
*  That was Zuckerberg. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5356.74s)]
*  That was Zuckerberg. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5357.58s)]
*  That's him. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5358.42s)]
*  That's why. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5359.26s)]
*  I thought you were gonna say that about him. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5360.099999999999s)]
*  I thought someone was imitating Zuckerberg. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5361.82s)]
*  No, no, that was him. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5362.94s)]
*  Okay, well that makes sense. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5363.9s)]
*  Zuckerberg doesn't have the ultimate tech guy voice. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5366.219999999999s)]
*  The one that drives me the most nuts is the up voice. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5369.46s)]
*  Basically what we're doing here, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5372.0199999999995s)]
*  you know that up speak? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5374.42s)]
*  That's like a tech sort of up speak. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5376.86s)]
*  I hate vocal fry. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5380.14s)]
*  What's that? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5381.58s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5382.42s)]
*  The girls do it all the time. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5383.98s)]

*  Uncut jams. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5387.46s)]
*  Vocal fry. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5390.3s)]

*  I don't think you can right now, right? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5397.24s)]
*  Yeah, right now it's already a little sketchy. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5400.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5403.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean how long? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5404.36s)]
*  How long before we have no idea what's real? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5405.84s)]
*  How long before the debates start up or whatever? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5412.12s)]
*  It's like a year? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5414.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5415.32s)]

*  Very intense. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5418.96s)]
*  Daily. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5420.0s)]
*  Hourly maybe. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5422.0s)]
*  Let's just go. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5422.84s)]
*  When you see AI, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5424.4s)]
*  when you see Zuckerberg's thing right there with AI, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5425.5199999999995s)]
*  doesn't it seem like the beginning of a movie [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5429.24s)]
*  that like 12 years ago, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5431.96s)]
*  like you see scientists working on things. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5434.44s)]
*  This is so exciting. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5436.48s)]

*  it really is coming true in its own way. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5450.799999999999s)]
*  Really is. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5453.5199999999995s)]

*  and rubbing their back while they watch sports. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5468.24s)]
*  Who's gonna get married then? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5473.2s)]

*  just get a job so they can pay for their robot? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5490.04s)]
*  Just see the scene from Terminator 2 [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5492.5199999999995s)]
*  where he explains what Skynet is. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5493.44s)]

*  Nobody predicts it right. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5637.16s)]
*  Nobody gets it right. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5638.64s)]
*  And that's why I wonder what we're getting wrong. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5639.76s)]
*  Like when we're thinking about what the future's gonna be, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5642.72s)]
*  I have a feeling it's gonna be, we're so off base. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5645.12s)]
*  I have a feeling whatever they invent, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5648.08s)]
*  whatever starts getting implemented, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5651.72s)]
*  whether it's Neuralink or something that changes [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5653.16s)]
*  the interface between humans and the web and technology, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5655.68s)]
*  I think it's gonna be bigger than all the things [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5659.68s)]
*  we've ever experienced. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5661.76s)]
*  I think our future, we're gonna look back. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5663.56s)]
*  And we're the last of the Mohicans [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5666.76s)]
*  because we're people that grew up without the internet [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5669.16s)]
*  and then had the internet when we were adults. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5671.12s)]
*  And now we're seeing kids grow up with the internet. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5673.360000000001s)]
*  And then there's gonna be the next thing. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5676.84s)]
*  And we're gonna be the people [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5679.32s)]
*  that went through the whole thing together. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5680.28s)]
*  Where everybody from the future [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5682.639999999999s)]
*  is just gonna be some weird cyborg. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5683.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5686.96s)]
*  That's where comedy's gonna die. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5688.4s)]
*  That's where fun's gonna die. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5691.04s)]
*  No more entertainment. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5694.16s)]
*  Everyone's just locked into the matrix. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5695.24s)]
*  And drones are going around shooting people. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5698.12s)]
*  Drones are telling you to go back to your place. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5700.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a new disease out. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5702.12s)]
*  There's a new variant. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5703.12s)]
*  You need your booster. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5704.719999999999s)]
*  I kinda think there's gonna be, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5706.16s)]
*  that version's gonna happen, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5707.88s)]
*  but someplace, I don't know, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5709.52s)]
*  pick a city, is gonna stay the same. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5710.6s)]
*  They'll be adverse to everything. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5713.6s)]
*  Pflugerville. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5715.4s)]
*  Yeah, maybe, but like, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5716.24s)]
*  no computers are here. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5717.68s)]
*  It's all manual. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5719.72s)]
*  It's all almost like Amish country. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5720.92s)]
*  Like there's nothing left. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5722.4800000000005s)]
*  But you can go there or you can go to, you know, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5723.92s)]
*  whatever San Francisco becomes [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5727.6s)]
*  if it's all taken by robots and shit. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5729.0s)]
*  For a while. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5731.16s)]
*  But there's no old west towns now anymore. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5732.0s)]
*  After a while, they'll die off. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5734.88s)]
*  No more wagons. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5736.08s)]
*  No more horseback. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5737.72s)]
*  Amish are even using cell phones. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5739.4400000000005s)]
*  That's true. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5740.84s)]
*  They're using cell phones? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5742.72s)]
*  We looked that up. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5743.84s)]
*  That's right. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5744.68s)]
*  We were talking about that so long. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5745.52s)]
*  They're doing molly and having raves. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5746.34s)]
*  Yeah, what is that called? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5748.4400000000005s)]
*  Rumpelstiltskin or something? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5749.4800000000005s)]
*  Rumpelstiltskin. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5750.8s)]
*  Rumpsprigga. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5751.64s)]
*  Rumpsprigga. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5752.4800000000005s)]

*  They do drugs and fuck. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5757.6s)]
*  They're only allowed to do it once though, right? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5759.84s)]
*  Like one, and then they go back to being an Amish. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5761.52s)]
*  Yeah, but they can last as long as they want. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5764.400000000001s)]
*  Right, but they can only do it once. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5766.52s)]
*  You can't go back and forth. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5767.8s)]
*  You can't Rumpelstiltskin like when you're 30. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5769.4400000000005s)]
*  Why would you ever go back? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5771.8s)]
*  Because they miss it. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5774.280000000001s)]
*  They miss the community. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5775.280000000001s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5777.92s)]
*  You miss what you know. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5778.84s)]
*  If you're used to living in a place [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5780.240000000001s)]
*  where everybody makes their own houses [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5781.8s)]
*  and people fucking pass butter around, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5783.240000000001s)]
*  you want to be in that group. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5787.040000000001s)]
*  You don't think you can do it? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5790.96s)]
*  Fuck no. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5792.200000000001s)]
*  I grew up in Ohio so we already kind of lived. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5793.200000000001s)]
*  The worst penalty is getting shunned by the community. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5795.72s)]
*  It's like what? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5797.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5798.72s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5799.56s)]
*  It's like okay, that's it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5800.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5801.96s)]
*  Yeah, but I bet they have very little crime because of it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5802.8s)]
*  Everybody chips in, but they're also a cult. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5805.68s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of a cult. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5810.0s)]
*  What are they basing it on? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5811.92s)]
*  There's different groups, I believe, I don't know. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5814.68s)]
*  There's different kinds of Amish? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5816.320000000001s)]
*  There's Amish and then there's Mennonites. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5817.16s)]
*  Mennonites aren't the same thing? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5820.320000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5821.68s)]
*  Mennonites are more strict or less strict. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5823.080000000001s)]
*  One or two. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5825.68s)]
*  I lived to buy a lot of Mennonites and they were hardcore. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5827.72s)]
*  Yeah? Stunk. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5830.4400000000005s)]

*  They don't wear deodorant or anything like that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5837.84s)]
*  Maybe the ones you were around. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5839.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5840.84s)]
*  It was a special, stinky Mennonite. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5841.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5844.4800000000005s)]

*  I would imagine if you were a person of that lifestyle, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5867.4800000000005s)]
*  you'd probably be pretty healthy [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5870.72s)]
*  because they're not eating processed foods, right? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5872.6s)]
*  They grow their own foods. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5875.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, you're super healthy. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5877.040000000001s)]

*  Probably mountainous hurt. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5878.84s)]
*  They probably don't have vitamins or anything. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5880.4s)]
*  Oh, because they don't take supplements, man? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5882.84s)]
*  They probably, potatoes and corn every day. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5884.92s)]
*  Dude. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5890.2s)]
*  I couldn't imagine living like that, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5894.0s)]
*  but I bet if you did live like that, it'd be normal. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5896.2s)]
*  I think people just adapt. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5898.679999999999s)]
*  Difference between Amish and Mennonites. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5900.04s)]
*  Well, they share a common Anabaptist heritage. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5902.4s)]
*  Amish and Mennonites have been separate groups [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5905.679999999999s)]

*  first in the 1700s and the 1800s. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5921.2s)]
*  Those fucking people that came down here in the 1700s, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=5924.2s)]

*  Cursive Z. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6056.0s)]
*  Z cursive. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6056.84s)]

*  There's another one that's weird too. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6076.88s)]
*  I think I stopped writing a cursive [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6079.88s)]
*  the moment I got out of high school though. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6081.240000000001s)]
*  My mom still writes me cursive letters [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6083.68s)]
*  once a month and sends them to me. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6085.64s)]

*  How do you think she'd handle it? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6099.96s)]
*  She would go to the hospital. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6101.04s)]
*  Definitely? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6104.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6104.92s)]

*  Weed wine. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6192.76s)]
*  Remember back in the day when weed [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6194.360000000001s)]
*  was not really legal yet in LA, [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6196.200000000001s)]
*  they had the first edibles. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6198.160000000001s)]
*  I remember people would always give you the weed wine [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6199.96s)]
*  and all these weird inventions. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6202.64s)]
*  Yeah, there was a lot of weird stuff. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6206.2s)]
*  It was during the medical days [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6208.12s)]
*  when you used to have to have a medical card. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6210.2s)]
*  That doctor you had that sold us the zinc [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6212.08s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6214.28s)]
*  We were spraying zinc in our mouth or some metal. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6215.12s)]
*  That doctor was very odd. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6218.44s)]
*  You remember you had that thing that attached to your ear [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6220.96s)]
*  that gets you to quit smoking? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6222.68s)]
*  I'm like, bitch, that is not gonna work. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6223.72s)]
*  You bought it for me and I'm like, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6226.96s)]
*  Joe, don't buy this. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6228.4s)]
*  It gives you an electrical pulse to your ear. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6229.44s)]
*  It's just electrocuted. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6231.84s)]
*  Try it, bro. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6232.68s)]
*  Maybe it'll do it for you. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6234.12s)]
*  That was so ridiculous. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6235.24s)]
*  He showed me a book on how Tesla energy [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6236.5599999999995s)]
*  was used to destroy the Twin Towers. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6240.2s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6242.38s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6244.5599999999995s)]
*  Did you see the planes at them? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6245.88s)]
*  It was the most crazy conversation. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6248.16s)]
*  I'm like, well, this is the type of person [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6250.0s)]
*  that gives out medical prescriptions for weed. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6251.5199999999995s)]
*  You're not getting the best minds. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6255.36s)]
*  Those guys were, they were taking chances. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6258.24s)]
*  Some of those guys got arrested and went to jail for it. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6261.2s)]
*  In the early days of medical marijuana, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6263.679999999999s)]
*  it was weird because you would get arrested [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6266.08s)]
*  and then when they would bring you to court, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6268.959999999999s)]
*  you weren't allowed to say medical marijuana [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6271.879999999999s)]
*  because medical marijuana was only a state thing. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6274.08s)]
*  In federal government's language, it was just marijuana. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6277.24s)]
*  So literally, you couldn't say you had a license [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6280.679999999999s)]
*  to grow it for medical patients. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6284.599999999999s)]
*  So in your trial, you were not allowed to tell the truth. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6287.56s)]
*  Yeah, because the federal government [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6292.56s)]
*  doesn't recognize states' laws [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6294.76s)]
*  when it comes to Schedule I substances. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6297.04s)]
*  So all these people that are making money off of weed, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6300.4s)]
*  it's like you're dancing this little weird line [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6302.36s)]
*  because federally, it's super illegal. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6304.8s)]
*  And yet states, I think now it's like 19 states or more [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6307.36s)]
*  have made it legal. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6311.68s)]
*  It's like at what point in time are they gonna let that go? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6313.32s)]
*  People have been in jail for marijuana. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6316.36s)]
*  I mean, it is a wild thing [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6318.759999999999s)]
*  that we have so many drugs that are available [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6323.88s)]
*  that can fuck you up and they're easy to get prescriptions [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6326.5199999999995s)]
*  for and marijuana is still illegal, federally. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6328.88s)]
*  Didn't they, weren't they going to change it? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6334.16s)]
*  Like wasn't it Biden or somebody? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6336.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're full of shit. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6338.2s)]
*  No one changes, they don't change shit, dude. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6341.24s)]
*  They don't change shit. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6344.08s)]
*  They don't change shit like that. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6345.64s)]
*  Those are those culture war subjects [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6346.76s)]
*  that they like to like bounce back and forth. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6348.240000000001s)]
*  They like the left to get upset, give us our marijuana [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6350.360000000001s)]
*  and the right wants their guns [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6353.0s)]
*  and then the right doesn't want you to have an abortion [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6354.280000000001s)]
*  and the left wants to have abortions. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6357.0s)]
*  These culture war issues never get cleaned up [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6359.280000000001s)]
*  because there's no benefit in cleaning them up. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6361.4400000000005s)]
*  There's no benefit in just settle them a resolve. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6363.76s)]
*  Even Roe v. Wade, like I thought we had that worked out [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6365.88s)]
*  and then all of a sudden they take that, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6368.96s)]
*  it's a culture war issue. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6370.360000000001s)]
*  Like they want people to be upset. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6372.4800000000005s)]
*  They took away our abortion [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6375.36s)]
*  and then the left is less likely to cross sides [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6376.92s)]
*  and join over to the right [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6381.12s)]
*  even though they believe in them fiscally and economically. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6382.2s)]
*  That right to abortion is a big one. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6385.04s)]
*  I think there was some really wild number, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6387.64s)]
*  like with women's right to choose, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6390.08s)]

*  for democratic Americans. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6396.96s)]
*  It's like some of the highest 60s, high 60%. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6399.64s)]
*  See if that's true. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6403.56s)]
*  How would you Google that? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6405.72s)]
*  Democrat right to choose? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6408.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6411.16s)]
*  Believe in it? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6412.0s)]

*  to discover your nighttime activities. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6630.0s)]
*  Walk in just baby oil over your bed. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6632.679999999999s)]
*  It would suck to be a maid, huh? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6635.799999999999s)]
*  You're just cleaning up old cum stuff everywhere. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6637.5199999999995s)]
*  Farts. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6640.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6644.36s)]
*  If they know they don't have to clean, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6645.2s)]
*  they just live like animals. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6646.759999999999s)]
*  It's not a good job. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6649.679999999999s)]
*  Have you seen the fucking wave of migrants [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6651.28s)]
*  that's making its way across the southern border [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6655.16s)]
*  now that Title 42 is about to expire? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6657.24s)]
*  Or pass or whatever the fuck is happening? [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6663.24s)]
*  What's Title 42? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6664.08s)]
*  We should Google that just so we get [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6666.759999999999s)]
*  an accurate description of what it is. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6668.639999999999s)]
*  But the migrants that are making their way [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6671.96s)]
*  across the border, it's crazy. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6675.04s)]
*  Like just the sheer number is insane. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6677.759999999999s)]
*  Title 42, end of the coronavirus, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6682.16s)]
*  restrictions and asylums. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6686.32s)]
*  Restrictions are often referred to as Title 42 [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6688.759999999999s)]
*  because the authority comes from Title 42 [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6693.04s)]
*  of a 1944 public health law that allows [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6694.92s)]
*  curbs on migration in the name of protecting public health. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6696.64s)]
*  So it's because of the pandemic. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6700.08s)]
*  The end of Title 42's use has raised questions [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6702.32s)]
*  about what will happen with migration [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6705.5199999999995s)]
*  at the US-Mexico border. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6707.24s)]
*  The Biden administration is preparing [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6708.5199999999995s)]
*  for an increase in migrants. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6709.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6713.08s)]
*  So just go to Google what it looks like on the border [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6713.92s)]
*  at the end of Title 42 and Mexican border. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6718.92s)]
*  But like there's some videos that show people [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6724.92s)]
*  making their way across. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6727.4s)]
*  Making my way across. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6729.4s)]
*  It's really crazy because just the sheer numbers are insane. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6731.8s)]
*  But it makes sense. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6736.84s)]
*  I mean, if I lived in Guatemala [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6737.68s)]
*  and I knew that there was some jobs in America, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6739.56s)]
*  there's so many people making their cross. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6743.72s)]
*  It's just happening all day long. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6745.88s)]
*  And to be fair, our whole country is going through a problem [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6747.6s)]
*  with people not wanting to work anymore because of COVID. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6751.6s)]
*  Kids are not going back to work. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6754.360000000001s)]
*  McDonald's is closing early [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6756.280000000001s)]
*  because they don't have enough workers. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6757.96s)]
*  So there is jobs for certain kind of people [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6759.56s)]
*  that I think have opened up since COVID, right? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6762.84s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's also criminals. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6765.76s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6767.96s)]
*  When you let people in illegally, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6768.8s)]
*  you don't know if they're cartel members. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6769.88s)]
*  You don't know if they're terrorists from another country. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6771.72s)]
*  You have no idea. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6774.68s)]
*  That's the whole reason for legal migration [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6775.96s)]
*  is you want people to be able to have a background check [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6778.12s)]
*  on scumbags and murderers. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6781.88s)]
*  But the fucking sheer bulk of people [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6785.88s)]
*  that are coming across here. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6788.56s)]
*  If you live in another country, this is the promised land. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6790.32s)]
*  And it just shows you even today, as fucked up as we are, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6794.04s)]
*  it's still a place where so much can happen. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6797.64s)]
*  You have so much freedom. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6799.76s)]
*  There's someone, you can start your own business. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6801.08s)]
*  You can get things popping. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6803.0s)]
*  And you don't even have to have an ID to vote. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6805.0s)]
*  You can vote forever, let's you in. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6807.56s)]
*  You can come over here, fake it. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6809.8s)]
*  There's places that want illegal immigrants [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6813.64s)]
*  to be able to vote. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6815.72s)]
*  Weren't they trying to do that in New York City? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6817.04s)]
*  I think so. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6820.08s)]
*  We're lucky. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6822.96s)]
*  Someone or our ancestor took the trip. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6824.08s)]
*  It's funny though that at a certain point in time, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6826.84s)]
*  we're like, stop, no more, no more new people. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6828.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6830.24s)]
*  Well, it says it got struck down. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6831.08s)]
*  Oh, they were trying to do it, but it got struck down? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6833.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're out of their fucking mind. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6835.16s)]
*  Illegal aliens voting. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6836.84s)]
*  No, the whole idea is like, you gotta be a citizen. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6838.0s)]
*  Okay, you gotta be all in on this. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6840.4s)]
*  You can't be from Saudi Arabia and vote in America. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6842.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6844.04s)]

*  He was just saying like, I'm a huge fan. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6971.76s)]
*  That's pretty nice. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6973.96s)]

*  What does this say? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6997.76s)]
*  He's an entrepreneur hosting an event [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=6998.96s)]
*  and his magazine says that he was expecting [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7000.52s)]
*  Elon Musk to attend, but he never guaranteed [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7002.6s)]

*  That's pretty goddamn close. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7031.52s)]
*  I think Elon said that he wants to meet him. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7033.36s)]
*  It's probably his son. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7036.44s)]

*  Well, there's only so many variables [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7139.96s)]
*  with facial features, right? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7142.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7143.96s)]
*  There's probably another Ari Shafir out there, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7144.8s)]
*  believe it or not. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7146.0s)]
*  There's probably tons of them. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7146.84s)]
*  How about that cat that looks like Ari? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7147.66s)]
*  Oh, that's the best one. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7149.92s)]
*  I found a new one the other day. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7150.76s)]
*  Those are great. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7152.96s)]
*  Can't Michael Larison unlock his phone? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7156.88s)]
*  He looks so much like him. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7158.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7160.68s)]
*  I think I heard that. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7161.52s)]
*  I don't think they pay for that phone anymore. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7162.34s)]
*  I think that, I'm seeing, I just Googled it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7165.24s)]
*  This says that people can do it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7167.48s)]
*  Even if, it could be unlocked [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7168.72s)]
*  even if you have an evil sibling [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7170.76s)]
*  who looks close enough to you. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7172.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7173.4s)]
*  They don't have to be a doppelganger. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7174.24s)]
*  And is this with Apple phones or with Android phones? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7175.08s)]
*  This is with iPhones. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7177.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7178.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, sometimes my phone's like the table over there [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7179.48s)]
*  and it unlocks. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7182.36s)]
*  I'm like, how did you even see me from over here? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7183.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7185.0s)]
*  It's weird how good it works. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7186.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7187.44s)]
*  Like bam, it's open right there. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7188.28s)]
*  Yeah, here's even on Apple's website, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7189.44s)]
*  my sister can unlock my phone and we are not twins. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7190.639999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7192.919999999999s)]
*  So, maybe test it. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7195.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7196.919999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7197.759999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7200.24s)]
*  Huh. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7201.879999999999s)]
*  I know that Android has an unlock [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7202.959999999999s)]
*  but it's not nearly as secure [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7205.28s)]
*  because it's not like a 3D image of your face. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7206.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7209.04s)]
*  So you can probably unlock with a photo. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7209.88s)]
*  It's definitely not as good as Face ID. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7211.4400000000005s)]
*  But don't you think like fingerprint's the best? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7213.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, the Face ID, I think, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7216.360000000001s)]
*  I never even think about it, you know. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7218.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7219.8s)]
*  Because it just works. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7220.64s)]
*  Just works. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7221.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7222.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think a fingerprint is, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7223.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, they have, I'm looking at my computer right now. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7225.52s)]
*  There's a camera looking at me. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7227.6s)]
*  They could put Face ID on it [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7228.84s)]
*  but they have the fingerprint scanner on it. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7230.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7232.56s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7233.400000000001s)]
*  And maybe there's another sensor in there [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7234.72s)]
*  that they can't put on top in here, I guess. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7235.96s)]
*  But I don't know what does it. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7237.8s)]
*  It is annoying though that with iPhones, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7239.08s)]
*  it takes up so much of your screen real estate. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7241.08s)]
*  That island in Face ID. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7243.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7245.64s)]
*  It's like that little strip is, it's kind of wack. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7246.4800000000005s)]
*  They're just waiting for the under camera technology [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7248.84s)]
*  to catch up. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7251.88s)]
*  So in like two years, iPhone will get rid of it. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7252.72s)]
*  And what is supposed to be going on with this Ultra? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7255.72s)]
*  Like if they're gonna have an Ultra phone, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7258.2s)]
*  like what's the purpose of that? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7259.64s)]
*  It's just a bigger one, I think. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7261.4s)]
*  That's it? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7262.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's it. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7263.8s)]
*  I thought it had like better specs [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7265.12s)]
*  because it showed that it has better screen. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7266.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7268.92s)]
*  The screen has less bezel. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7269.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7270.96s)]
*  I think that they're just doing what they're doing right now. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7271.8s)]
*  Like the big one always has a little bit better features, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7275.160000000001s)]
*  a little bit. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7277.92s)]
*  So they make people buy the most expensive shit possible [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7278.76s)]
*  with the Ultra watch. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7280.76s)]
*  Just a physical mock-up. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7281.6s)]
*  So they could make cases and shit. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7283.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think that they've leaked any [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7285.4400000000005s)]
*  useful use cases or anything. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7288.88s)]
*  But if you think about people and like their desire [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7290.92s)]
*  to always have the latest, greatest, most expensive shit, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7293.56s)]
*  they're all gonna get the Ultra. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7296.080000000001s)]
*  That's probably gonna be the number one selling phone. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7297.68s)]
*  People are, I can't believe it, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7299.200000000001s)]
*  $2,500 phone is selling so well. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7300.04s)]
*  Especially if they put one of those, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7302.280000000001s)]
*  like the M1 or M2, I guess it's M2 chip [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7303.72s)]
*  that allows you to do Final Cut or Logic. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7306.0s)]
*  If this is what unlocks the new headset, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7308.160000000001s)]
*  the virtual, like the AR headset, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7310.6s)]
*  then 100% that's gonna be like wide-bought. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7312.080000000001s)]
*  Is the virtual AR headset a guarantee? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7313.96s)]
*  That's definitely happening. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7316.4400000000005s)]
*  Supposedly next month. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7317.6s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7318.84s)]
*  Next month? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7319.68s)]
*  Yeah, they have that W, whatever, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7320.5s)]
*  that thing they do once a year [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7322.0s)]
*  where Apple releases new stuff. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7324.32s)]
*  And supposedly it's gonna be announced next month. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7325.799999999999s)]
*  And it's gonna have like an external battery pack, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7329.5199999999995s)]
*  which is kinda weird. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7332.4s)]
*  You have to wear something around you [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7333.799999999999s)]
*  on your belts or something. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7334.919999999999s)]
*  There's not much really known about it. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7337.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is a picture they've shown. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7339.44s)]
*  That's the best picture. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7340.799999999999s)]
*  I guess everyone's agreeing [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7342.28s)]
*  is this is what it's gonna look like. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7343.28s)]
*  I gotta piss. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7344.96s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7345.799999999999s)]
*  Do you do the tea injection yourself? [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7346.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7349.839999999999s)]
*  I talked to that guy about it the other day. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7351.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like, you need to get on mine. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7354.08s)]
*  You just get it sent to you. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7355.36s)]
*  Oh, you're getting your injections at a doctor's studio? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7356.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I go once a week. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7358.92s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7360.12s)]
*  Yeah, but I get tested once a week. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7361.0199999999995s)]
*  He's making sure everything's cool and stuff. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7362.84s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7364.48s)]
*  And I have to get, I have to bleed. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7365.32s)]
*  They make me bleed. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7367.88s)]
*  They bleed? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7369.2s)]
*  Yeah, because there's like a level in your blood [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7370.04s)]
*  that you have to get below. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7371.8s)]
*  You get a lot of blood? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7374.08s)]
*  You get extra blood? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7375.16s)]
*  It has something to do with, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7376.0s)]
*  I don't know what it's called. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7377.599999999999s)]
*  It's like blood cells. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7378.679999999999s)]
*  You have too much white blood cells [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7380.16s)]
*  or one of the cells that happens from tea. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7383.02s)]
*  There's a video that's gone around a lot. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7387.62s)]
*  I think it's bloodletting, right? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7389.14s)]
*  Where they pop something in your forehead [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7390.26s)]
*  and let the blood squirt out. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7391.9800000000005s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7393.14s)]
*  And I don't know why people do it. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7393.9800000000005s)]
*  Because they're dumb? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7395.02s)]
*  Maybe, but do you know what I'm talking about? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7395.84s)]
*  No. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7397.02s)]
*  No? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7397.860000000001s)]
*  Bloodletting from your forehead? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7398.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7399.66s)]
*  I thought, I only know of it. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7401.900000000001s)]
*  I thought it was something we talked about here. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7403.14s)]
*  Bloodletting from your forehead. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7404.9400000000005s)]
*  That sounds like leeches. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7406.58s)]
*  That sounds like some old school shit. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7408.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7410.34s)]
*  Bloodletting? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7411.18s)]
*  You know what is it called? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7412.02s)]
*  Trepening? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7414.22s)]
*  Where they drill holes in the heads to relieve pressure. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7415.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7418.3s)]
*  So the spirits would get in there. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7419.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7420.1s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7420.9400000000005s)]
*  It might not be called bloodletting, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7421.780000000001s)]
*  but this is the video I'm talking about. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7423.06s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7425.02s)]
*  Why the legs? [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7428.26s)]
*  Oh, see he makes the blood. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7429.1s)]
*  Blood drained from forehead in bloodletting procedure. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7430.62s)]
*  That is what it's called. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7433.34s)]
*  For what reason? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7434.46s)]
*  I guess it's in China is where they're doing this one. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7435.3s)]
*  Oh, but that's like fucking voodoo shit. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7436.9400000000005s)]
*  Why would that be good to cut your squid? [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7440.58s)]
*  Just for it to out. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7443.26s)]
*  Why are we watching this? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7444.1s)]
*  I'm not showing it online. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7445.74s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7446.86s)]
*  Boy, that's a lot of blood. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7447.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7449.42s)]
*  And it's one of those things. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7450.38s)]
*  They have it blurred out where the blood hits the pan. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7451.9s)]
*  Why? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7454.0599999999995s)]
*  Because you can't handle it. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7454.9s)]
*  You can handle it squirting out of his head, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7455.9s)]
*  but you can't handle it hitting the pan. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7457.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's stupid. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7461.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7463.7s)]
*  All right. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7464.54s)]
*  I think that's probably just stupid. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7465.36s)]
*  If I had to guess. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7467.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7469.34s)]
*  Something about recycling your blood though, right? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7470.18s)]
*  Isn't there? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7472.22s)]
*  That's not recycling it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7473.06s)]
*  This is doing it into a urinal. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7473.900000000001s)]
*  Like what is he doing? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7476.14s)]
*  He's peeing blood out of his head. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7477.34s)]
*  It's quite common used to treat pain, swelling, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7479.78s)]
*  or other disorders related to blood congestions. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7482.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7485.66s)]
*  It's like the LA traffic in your veins. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7486.5s)]
*  Blood congestion? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7490.1s)]
*  So like bloodletting is actually a real medical procedure? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7491.34s)]
*  I think in the case we just watched, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7497.14s)]
*  it might've been to reduce eye swelling. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7498.58s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7503.3s)]
*  I do know that ever since I started doing tea, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7504.46s)]
*  I haven't had hemorrhoid, bloody hemorrhoid anymore. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7506.5s)]
*  It went away for a year. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7510.02s)]
*  I haven't had one. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7511.58s)]
*  And I think that was my period from all the estrogen. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7512.5s)]
*  Don't you think? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7515.1s)]
*  Like I think I was really having a period [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7515.9400000000005s)]
*  that wasn't a hemorrhoid the whole time. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7518.22s)]
*  Don't you think that some of it comes from [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7519.9400000000005s)]
*  sitting on the toilet, reading your phone? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7521.66s)]
*  Yeah, but I haven't stopped doing that. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7524.1s)]
*  Maybe the testosterone has made your butthole muscles [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7527.06s)]
*  more robust. Muscles, yeah, maybe. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7529.74s)]
*  So they can handle. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7531.22s)]
*  I thought it was weird though. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7532.5s)]
*  It seems weird to talk about it. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7533.9800000000005s)]
*  No, because I always joke that was my man period. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7537.58s)]
*  And I think it really was. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7540.22s)]
*  I think it really was. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7541.42s)]
*  It could be. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7544.26s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7545.26s)]
*  Yeah, Ari went through that for like most of his life. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7546.62s)]
*  He still goes through it. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7549.06s)]
*  Okay, why? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7550.5s)]
*  I thought the same thing. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7552.26s)]
*  What is that about? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7553.34s)]
*  Maybe his estrogen's high. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7554.18s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7555.5s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7556.58s)]
*  It does. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7557.58s)]
*  Only freaks out sometimes. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7558.42s)]
*  Yeah, his butt's been bleeding since he was in high school. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7562.86s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if he gets his butt checked though. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7566.1s)]
*  Because I mean, he's got a lot of stuff going on there. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7568.22s)]
*  Yeah, it can't be good. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7571.26s)]
*  He's not going to the doctor. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7573.26s)]
*  No, you don't think so? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7574.42s)]
*  No. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7575.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7576.1s)]
*  He's always in fucking Asia. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7576.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7578.54s)]
*  Backpacking. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7579.38s)]
*  Weird. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7580.42s)]
*  Going on his walkabouts. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7581.26s)]
*  Not for me. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7582.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7583.82s)]
*  Yeah, with a bloody butt. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7585.46s)]
*  Bloody butt walking through Asia. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7587.38s)]
*  I was thinking of that. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7589.54s)]
*  Or your mom's house, he was always explaining [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7590.38s)]
*  like he didn't want to poop because it was like [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7592.06s)]
*  a waste of time. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7593.5s)]
*  What? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7594.9800000000005s)]
*  When he was younger? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7595.82s)]
*  I don't even think of that young. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7596.66s)]
*  So he just held his poop in? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7598.74s)]
*  Yeah, he just like forced himself to be constipated. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7599.94s)]
*  He was like once a week or something. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7601.74s)]
*  Oh my God, I love pooping. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7603.06s)]
*  Yeah, and then I'll leave out the rest of the details [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7604.9800000000005s)]
*  of the story that are worse. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7608.34s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7609.5s)]
*  But yeah, it's just Ari. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7611.02s)]
*  It gets Ari-fied. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7613.26s)]
*  How can one even hold your poop in? [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7615.02s)]
*  I don't get it. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7617.820000000001s)]
*  How long can you hold it in? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7618.780000000001s)]
*  If you have to take a shit, you have to go. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7620.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7621.820000000001s)]
*  How are you doing it for days? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7622.66s)]
*  He's like forcing constipation. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7625.22s)]
*  But that doesn't even make sense. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7627.14s)]
*  It seems impossible. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7628.700000000001s)]
*  It also seems really deadly. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7629.58s)]
*  We can talk about it next time he's here, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7631.58s)]
*  but if I remember to bring it up. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7632.900000000001s)]
*  No, I don't mean. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7634.26s)]
*  Why are we even talking about it now? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7635.5s)]
*  Came over here to promote Red Band's club. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7637.820000000001s)]
*  Not talking about Ari's butt. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7641.26s)]
*  How many nights a week are you guys open right now? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7645.18s)]
*  We're open every night. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7646.740000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of shows, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7648.34s)]

*  and we have a lot of karaoke. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7651.22s)]
*  We've been doing karaoke, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7652.3s)]
*  so it's fun watching all the comics get wasted [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7653.5s)]
*  at the end of the night and just get drunk and do karaoke. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7656.1s)]
*  And I embarrassly did it the other day. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7659.38s)]
*  What'd you sing? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7662.26s)]

*  So I tried- [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7679.0599999999995s)]

*  Well, I guess it had to start with technology, right? [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7783.68s)]
*  Because you had to be able to see the scroll. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7785.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7787.76s)]

*  Yeah, karaoke kind of fell out of favor [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7805.799999999999s)]
*  and then came back into favor, like with nostalgia, right? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7808.16s)]
*  Because there was a time period [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7812.2s)]

*  Oh my God, they just carried around the phone. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7908.459999999999s)]
*  They had to type with their fingers. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7909.919999999999s)]
*  They don't have the implant. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7911.82s)]
*  How often do you do text to type or talk to type? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7912.9s)]
*  Not as much as I should. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7916.179999999999s)]
*  I do it all the time. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7917.419999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7918.24s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7919.08s)]
*  They're so good. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7920.0199999999995s)]
*  They're so accurate. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7920.94s)]
*  I do it in my car whenever I'm in. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7921.82s)]
*  Yeah, I do it in my car too, but I do it a lot. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7923.299999999999s)]
*  Just like, it's so much quicker than typing it. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7925.94s)]
*  And as long as you're not saying something weird. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7929.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7931.62s)]
*  Where it doesn't know what the fuck you're saying. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7932.459999999999s)]
*  Like some weird name of something or something like that. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7933.5s)]
*  My problem is I do it for notes when I think of a joke [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7936.12s)]
*  and I want to write it down real quick. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7938.84s)]
*  And then I won't proofread it. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7940.8s)]
*  And then there's like some weird words in it. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7943.2s)]
*  And then it totally makes me not remember [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7945.12s)]
*  what the joke's about. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7946.88s)]
*  Like, wait, what? [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7947.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7948.599999999999s)]
*  You know, sometimes it fucks up too much. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7949.44s)]
*  Well, apparently Google's version of that is better. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7951.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7953.64s)]
*  Google's voice to type is better. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7954.48s)]
*  Have you used it all? [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7956.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've used Google's voice. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7956.96s)]
*  Do you still have a Galaxy fuckword? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7958.12s)]
*  Two galaxies, or two, I have the flip. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7961.28s)]
*  The fold. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7965.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7966.18s)]
*  The flip one, the small. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7967.02s)]
*  Oh, you have the flip one, yeah. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7967.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I have the S23 Ultra. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7968.9800000000005s)]
*  Which one do you fuck with the most? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7970.780000000001s)]
*  The S23 Ultra. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7973.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good phone. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7974.18s)]
*  It's great. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7975.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7975.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7976.700000000001s)]
*  Cameras are fucking incredible. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7978.1s)]
*  It's so amazing that you could film a movie off a phone now. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7979.8s)]
*  Like legitimately film a movie. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7982.62s)]
*  If you do it right, like, you could watch it on television. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7984.780000000001s)]
*  It'd be a great movie. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7989.02s)]
*  Like that's completely possible now. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7990.1s)]
*  If they do put Final Cut Pro on your phone, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7992.14s)]
*  how many movies are going to be made where it's [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7996.06s)]
*  shot and edited on an iPhone? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=7998.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they're showing the Apple trailer [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8000.14s)]
*  for the Final Cut Pro, where they're showing them, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8002.1s)]
*  use the iPad and film it, then edit it. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8004.1s)]
*  And with the Apple Pencil, like you can now draw on the film [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8007.62s)]
*  so you can make effects. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8011.1s)]
*  Like if you want to have like a pow thing, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8012.14s)]
*  you can like draw the pow and it will animate the effect. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8013.900000000001s)]
*  It's like taking Final Cut Pro to another level [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8017.5s)]
*  where you can draw on it now and do effects [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8019.42s)]
*  using your Apple Pencil. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8021.3s)]
*  Oh, so it actually makes it better than having a computer. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8022.54s)]
*  Kind of, yeah. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8024.900000000001s)]
*  Kind of. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8025.7s)]
*  Kind of. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8026.22s)]
*  Unless you have a computer attached to a tablet, [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8026.62s)]
*  like a Wacom or something. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8028.62s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8029.74s)]
*  What's next? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8033.54s)]
*  It's the neural interface, right? [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8034.58s)]
*  That's next. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8036.54s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8037.54s)]
*  That's going to be the big game changer. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8038.54s)]
*  That's going to be weird, man, because we're all [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8041.9400000000005s)]
*  going to want to do it. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8044.14s)]
*  Because the people that do it are [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8044.9400000000005s)]
*  going to have a big advantage. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8046.26s)]
*  They're going to be just completely connected [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8048.54s)]
*  to technology. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8051.58s)]
*  And then who's going to be in control of that? [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8053.5s)]
*  What? [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8056.62s)]
*  I just remembered I wanted to show you something. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8057.38s)]
*  Oh. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8059.54s)]
*  Because who's going to be in control of it? [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8060.54s)]
*  I think the wearables, like the AR, VR glasses that Apple [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8063.0199999999995s)]
*  is going to do, but not having a phone anymore [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8067.42s)]
*  and just having glasses on is definitely going to be a thing. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8069.5s)]
*  Think about how locked in people are to their social media, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8072.34s)]
*  to their Twitter. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8075.38s)]
*  When people get banned from Twitter back in the day, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8076.42s)]
*  they were devastated. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8078.860000000001s)]
*  That was like an exile from the community. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8080.3s)]
*  Imagine something like that, but that's your brain. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8083.22s)]
*  You're locked into this community, a rigid community, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8087.58s)]
*  where you have to think and behave in a certain way, [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8092.1s)]
*  or you get exiled. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8094.62s)]
*  This is what I oot about. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8098.18s)]
*  Oh. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8099.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8099.860000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8100.38s)]
*  Did you see this? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8100.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I did see this. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8101.54s)]
*  So play it. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8102.66s)]
*  New gameplay proves Unrecord is real. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8103.5s)]
*  Is this the name of the game? [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8107.9s)]
*  I think the game is called Unrecord, correct. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8109.1s)]
*  So this is a guy clearing a room. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8111.5s)]
*  He's got a pistol in front of him. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8115.02s)]
*  It looks insanely real. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8116.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's like body cam footage angle [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8117.9s)]
*  is how it's supposed to be designed. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8121.38s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8123.34s)]
*  So yeah, this trailer came out, and it [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8124.1s)]
*  freaked a lot of people out. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8125.42s)]
*  They're like, this is too real. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8126.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8128.94s)]
*  You guys fucked up. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8129.34s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8130.5s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8132.26s)]
*  I mean, everything from the brass. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8136.18s)]
*  You can tell it's fake right there, the smoke from the gun. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8137.780000000001s)]
*  But yeah, this is crossing a line of realism that is like, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8142.46s)]
*  what are we doing? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8149.38s)]
*  Is this a game, or is this a training simulator? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8150.9800000000005s)]
*  And they blur his face. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8153.26s)]
*  It's what a fun little thing they do. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8154.42s)]
*  Because this is body cam footage. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8158.780000000001s)]
*  This is incredible, man. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8160.78s)]
*  They did recently, though, make a new version of a trailer [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8164.0199999999995s)]
*  to show people that this is a game. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8166.58s)]
*  This is made in Unreal. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8168.58s)]
*  This isn't footage from a real cop or someone [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8170.34s)]
*  clearing a building. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8173.9s)]
*  So this is the Unreal 4 engine? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8174.82s)]
*  So this is 5. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8177.34s)]
*  Think what they've been doing since we've [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8178.099999999999s)]
*  been talking about it a few times now. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8179.34s)]
*  It's been getting updated probably monthly [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8180.94s)]
*  with new features and new additions and new add-ons that [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8182.78s)]
*  are making the Unreal 5 even better, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8185.94s)]
*  exponentially better all the time. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8190.26s)]
*  It's a free tool. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8194.300000000001s)]
*  So I don't know how much time someone put in this. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8195.18s)]
*  Probably a lot. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8197.58s)]
*  But it could have, in theory, been made by a small group. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8198.300000000001s)]
*  This is wild, man. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8200.86s)]
*  Yeah, because a lot of this is just assets. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8202.62s)]
*  I want a tire image. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8204.5s)]
*  I want a keg image. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8205.62s)]
*  Yeah, almost like how Beeple was explaining to us. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8207.78s)]
*  He just goes in and finds assets online and makes stuff. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8209.82s)]
*  You can start doing this. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8212.82s)]
*  Listen, I would have a real problem with this game. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8213.86s)]
*  I'm having a real problem just watching it. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8219.38s)]
*  And I don't know if it's going to be in VR, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8221.22s)]
*  which I would imagine it is. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8222.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it will be. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8224.259999999998s)]
*  This kind of gameplay, you can easily make in VR. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8225.179999999998s)]
*  Why is the person's face blurred? [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8227.779999999999s)]
*  Because it's supposed to be a body cam footage [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8229.58s)]
*  and you're supposed to be watching [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8231.58s)]
*  the look of we're watching this in court. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8234.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8236.98s)]
*  It's like a- [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8238.859999999999s)]
*  Here's how it did look. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8239.5s)]
*  It's a little not as clear. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8241.38s)]
*  Now it's updated in the 4K. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8244.019999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8245.939999999999s)]
*  Which means that the trees, the sky, the building textures. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8247.98s)]
*  Why do you think the metaverse didn't take off? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8253.539999999999s)]
*  Why was that a colossal failure? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8255.3s)]
*  Well, it's because it's- [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8257.939999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, Zuckerberg's version of the metaverse [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8261.38s)]
*  is that no one has legs. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8265.539999999999s)]
*  Everyone looks like Nintendo Wii characters and stuff. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8268.22s)]
*  And it's goofy where you look at something like VRChat, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8271.5s)]
*  which I use. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8275.66s)]
*  You can be anything you want. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8276.699999999999s)]
*  You could have a scan of you and make it look super realistic. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8277.94s)]
*  So when you're talking to somebody, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8280.980000000001s)]
*  you look like you're talking to a real person. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8282.380000000001s)]
*  But like that. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8284.86s)]
*  See, that's actually a woman that used her phone [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8286.460000000001s)]
*  and scanned her image into an avatar. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8289.460000000001s)]
*  And that's the stuff that's cool. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8292.26s)]
*  And unfortunately, Zuckerberg and all those guys [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8294.54s)]
*  have been pushing this ridiculous Nintendo Wii. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8296.42s)]
*  Now this was just so this was Zuckerberg. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8299.58s)]
*  This is Meta's product. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8302.74s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8303.62s)]
*  But that's the metaverse. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8305.86s)]
*  He's not selling this metaverse, right? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8307.86s)]
*  He's selling this silly version of it. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8309.82s)]
*  So what's the silly version? [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8312.22s)]
*  Is the fact that you have to headset? [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8313.3s)]
*  Could you just type in the- [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8315.26s)]
*  Oculus worlds, I think? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8317.38s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8318.38s)]
*  That's the stuff that what he's showing [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8321.1s)]
*  is more closer to what I'm using right now. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8322.98s)]
*  And that's VRChat. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8325.3s)]
*  This is, see, look at all these goofy characters. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8327.22s)]
*  See, you have no legs. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8331.539999999999s)]
*  You look like a little cart. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8332.74s)]
*  It looks like for kids. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8333.94s)]
*  And what you were just watching with that other image [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8336.3s)]
*  that is coming sooner, you know, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8339.22s)]
*  that's the kind of stuff that's already out there [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8341.42s)]
*  and that I use. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8343.58s)]
*  I could be a realistic person. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8346.14s)]
*  I could be a cartoon character. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8347.619999999999s)]
*  I could be anything I want. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8348.82s)]
*  I have legs. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8349.66s)]
*  This is just like, I don't know, for kids. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8350.9s)]
*  It's very kids. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8353.14s)]
*  This is not the only thing that was available, right? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8354.5s)]
*  Correct. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8357.06s)]
*  This is just to hang out and talk to people, I guess. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8357.98s)]
*  Right, but this is what Zuckerberg, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8360.259999999998s)]
*  like the metaverse, this is his, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8361.82s)]
*  where he's spending billions of dollars [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8364.06s)]
*  thinking this kind of thing's gonna take off. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8365.380000000001s)]
*  And you know. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8367.74s)]
*  So here's something that I asked someone over a year ago [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8368.62s)]
*  that I didn't understand, [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8371.14s)]
*  because we hadn't seen the AI stuff. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8372.460000000001s)]
*  There's spaces like this, [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8375.58s)]
*  I'll try to pull it back up on the screen. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8376.78s)]
*  When this guy is like floating around in here, [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8378.74s)]
*  this is not how they did it, I'll be honest with you, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8381.3s)]
*  but this is how it was explained to me. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8382.82s)]
*  When you're in that world, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8384.3s)]
*  it shows like a missile silo or something. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8386.22s)]
*  You could be like, nope, don't make that a missile silo. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8388.14s)]
*  I wanna be on a beach. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8390.1s)]
*  You just say that and it'll go, okay, poof. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8391.18s)]
*  Yeah. Now you're on a beach. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8393.7s)]
*  It's like, no, it's too cartoony. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8394.62s)]
*  Make it more realistic. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8396.26s)]
*  And it'll be like more realistic beach. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8397.54s)]
*  And that's how some of the metaverse stuff [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8399.18s)]
*  is supposed to be. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8400.980000000001s)]
*  It's not here yet though. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8402.34s)]
*  And I don't know how long it's gonna take to get here. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8403.62s)]
*  But isn't a barrier to entry just the putting on goggles? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8405.980000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of people don't wanna do that. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8410.380000000001s)]
*  Right, well, it also makes people sick. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8412.380000000001s)]
*  It also, you know, a lot of problems. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8416.460000000001s)]
*  And that's mostly based off frame rate. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8417.820000000002s)]
*  So like if you're using something that is poorly made, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8422.460000000001s)]
*  like software, like an app, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8425.94s)]
*  and you put it on and the frame rate's shit, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8428.18s)]
*  then you're just gonna get sick immediately. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8431.06s)]
*  Is it too low a frame rate? [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8433.54s)]
*  Yeah, too low a frame rate, you start getting sick. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8434.78s)]
*  So it just confuses you? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8436.74s)]
*  Yeah, it just makes you feel like uneasy. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8437.9s)]
*  Like, you know, when you're spinning on a carnival ride [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8439.5s)]
*  or something and your stomach starts getting low. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8441.98s)]
*  That makes sense where if your mind, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8443.5s)]
*  if your eyeballs are seeing something [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8446.14s)]
*  that's blurry and fucked, [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8448.02s)]
*  your mind might say, oh my God, you're sick. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8449.66s)]
*  You should throw up. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8451.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8452.7s)]
*  You ate something bad, you're dying. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8453.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8454.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8455.54s)]
*  And here's something I'll show you. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8456.380000000001s)]
*  There's not a lot of content [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8459.060000000001s)]
*  and Facebook may be fucking up [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8460.220000000001s)]
*  by not showing this stuff more. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8461.74s)]
*  So Canon made this dual fisheye lens. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8462.94s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's the only one that's out there right now. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8464.900000000001s)]
*  That allows you to shoot content [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8467.140000000001s)]
*  to be watched in these headsets. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8469.58s)]
*  And when it's done right, [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8471.58s)]
*  which hasn't been done right very much, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8473.18s)]
*  but when it is done right, it's fucking amazing. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8475.140000000001s)]
*  It is wild how cool it looks. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8478.300000000001s)]
*  But there's not a lot to look at right now. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8480.42s)]
*  And you have to put the headset on to see it. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8482.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8484.22s)]
*  But things in front of you look like [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8485.06s)]
*  you should just reach out and touch them. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8486.5s)]
*  And they're in high definition quality. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8487.7s)]
*  It seems like every iteration of these things, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8489.5s)]
*  we're always waiting for the one that's like, that's it. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8491.9s)]
*  Like if you go back to when VR was first talked about, [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8495.460000000001s)]
*  it was like the 80s and 90s. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8499.26s)]
*  Remember they thought that that was gonna be a thing. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8500.78s)]
*  You put on the goggles, you're in another world. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8503.14s)]
*  But technology wasn't really there. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8505.18s)]
*  And then all of a sudden with Oculus and with the HTC Vive, [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8506.94s)]
*  we're getting real close. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8510.22s)]
*  Now we're getting real close, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8511.66s)]
*  but it's still like not quite. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8512.7s)]
*  That was the VR in the 90s. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8514.98s)]
*  That's what they think Apple is gonna do with their headset. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8516.78s)]
*  That it's gonna be that cool, supposedly. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8520.06s)]
*  This is VR in the 90s. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8522.14s)]
*  So they probably thought this is the beginning. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8523.3s)]
*  We're getting ready and this is gonna be the future. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8525.7s)]
*  And even to use this, you had to be in a big pod. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8527.94s)]
*  Like those pods we almost wanna use now, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8529.82s)]
*  but the pod was just to track you. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8531.74s)]
*  Like if you went out of the pod, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8533.38s)]
*  it wasn't reading you anything inside the pod it read. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8534.539999999999s)]
*  And you had to have all sorts of cables and wires [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8537.1s)]
*  and things connected to you. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8539.18s)]
*  Still though. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8540.42s)]
*  Where did they have this at? [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8541.54s)]
*  They did at CoSci. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8542.58s)]
*  So this is in the 90s. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8544.14s)]
*  And here we are, 2023. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8546.54s)]
*  It's still not quite. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8549.78s)]
*  You would have thought that would have taken off. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8551.42s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8553.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the headset looks like. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8554.58s)]
*  Which they still have these things in arcades [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8557.220000000001s)]
*  all over the place. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8559.62s)]
*  The graphics got a little better. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8560.7s)]
*  One of the things they think they're gonna be able to do [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8562.26s)]
*  is recreate psychedelic experiences. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8564.1s)]
*  They think they're gonna be able to make [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8567.7s)]
*  a VR psychedelic experience. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8569.1s)]
*  So you could trip balls without having to do any drugs [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8570.94s)]
*  and it'll have the same effect on your mind. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8574.140000000001s)]
*  I do a pretty good version of it all the time. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8576.300000000001s)]
*  The thing I play all the time, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8579.94s)]
*  I have a character that you could do DMT, acid, mushrooms, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8581.1s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8584.740000000002s)]
*  And you take it and you start seeing [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8585.580000000002s)]
*  a little bit of trails on your hands. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8587.980000000001s)]
*  And then the more you start seeing more trails. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8589.62s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8591.94s)]
*  And you could do DMT where there's like [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8593.580000000002s)]
*  fucking like Buddhas coming out of the ground. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8595.1s)]
*  That look like lasers and shit. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8598.5s)]
*  Really? [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8599.9s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes we'll just listen to music get high [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8600.74s)]
*  and just do that for hours. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8602.98s)]
*  And what are you using? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8605.46s)]
*  What is this? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8607.7s)]
*  This looks like unreal. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8608.54s)]
*  Someone's made a shrimp trip. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8609.78s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8611.98s)]
*  This just goes on for a few minutes. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8614.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's just different visuals and stuff. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8616.54s)]
*  How many grams did you say that is? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8618.54s)]
*  Yeah, see, oh I love that lighting effect [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8619.78s)]
*  where it's like clouds, shadows. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8621.66s)]
*  Maybe this is a real video and they fucked with it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8623.94s)]
*  This is a real dog. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8626.42s)]
*  Yeah, this is a real video. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8627.26s)]
*  The dog knows you're tripping. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8631.5s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8632.66s)]
*  So what are you using? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8635.3s)]
*  I'm using VRChat, which is like the good version [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8636.42s)]
*  of what Zuckerberg's trying to do. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8639.94s)]
*  And VRChat is connected how? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8641.62s)]
*  Like using a PC? [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8643.7s)]
*  It's free. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8644.9s)]
*  You could actually use an Oculus 4. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8645.74s)]
*  You're not gonna get that great of graphics, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8647.18s)]
*  but I'm using like a really high end PC [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8649.1s)]
*  and a Valve Index headset. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8651.34s)]
*  And it's a VRChat's free. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8653.86s)]
*  And it's kind of like, you just download it, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8657.060000000001s)]
*  you make your character or whatever. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8658.900000000001s)]
*  And then you go, hey, I wanna go to Disneyland. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8660.5s)]
*  Or hey, I wanna go on a beach. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8662.78s)]
*  And you just type in beach and it's like Google. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8665.62s)]
*  And they'll show you all the worlds you can go to. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8668.02s)]
*  Then you go there, meet up with your friends, [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8670.5s)]
*  do acid on the beach or whatever. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8672.7s)]
*  And the graphics are really high end? [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8674.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, each level is made by a different person. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8675.900000000001s)]
*  So there's like good versions of it and bad versions of it. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8680.78s)]
*  And there's realistic versions of it. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8684.54s)]
*  So this is like the real cutting edge? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8686.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is what, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8689.02s)]
*  this is way more popular times a lot than Zuckerberg's stuff. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8692.5s)]
*  Really? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8696.5s)]
*  Like how many people are using this? [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8697.34s)]
*  It's one of the largest user base [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8698.58s)]
*  of a multiplayer game on Steam. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8703.660000000002s)]
*  There is another thing that which I don't like, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8706.26s)]
*  you're hung up on that headset. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8708.380000000001s)]
*  You don't, maybe Tenei you do, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8710.58s)]
*  you use the headset. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8712.980000000001s)]
*  You'll be able to play with me and Brian. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8713.82s)]
*  If we have our headsets on, just through a browser like this. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8715.380000000001s)]
*  Oh, you can do that right now. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8717.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to put the headset on. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8718.66s)]
*  Oh, so you can play it like a video game. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8720.42s)]
*  Or a chat room. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8722.220000000001s)]
*  Now, what is the best version of graphics? [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8723.460000000001s)]
*  Like these things are all made by different people. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8726.34s)]
*  So what's the best version? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8728.66s)]
*  So if I were to play this right now with you, [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8730.380000000001s)]
*  I have bookmarked like all these worlds. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8733.54s)]
*  So like I have the best world to go to [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8735.78s)]
*  if you wanna be in a beach, best world [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8737.460000000001s)]
*  if you wanna be on the moon. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8739.94s)]
*  So, like look at this bar. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8741.7s)]
*  This kind of has good lighting and stuff. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8744.34s)]
*  But you know, it almost looks like a nice realistic bar. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8745.900000000001s)]
*  And look at that character. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8748.900000000001s)]
*  See, like that's somebody that scanned himself, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8749.740000000002s)]
*  it looks like. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8751.5s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8752.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8753.62s)]
*  How weird. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8754.460000000001s)]
*  And so now you look back at what we were just watching [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8755.7s)]
*  with Zuckerberg's, you know, metaverse, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8758.300000000001s)]
*  and it's so silly compared to this, you know, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8760.58s)]
*  like graphic wise, it's like, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8762.820000000002s)]
*  you can be anything in it, you want. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8765.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but isn't the metaverse stuff, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8766.820000000002s)]
*  the Zuckerberg stuff capable of doing things like this? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8768.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, that's why people, [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8771.34s)]
*  why it's not working though. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8774.06s)]
*  Like look at that, that looks like a real ice bin [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8774.94s)]
*  for popsicles, you know, like at a convenience store. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8777.58s)]
*  You know, that's not the graphics you're seeing on Zuckerberg. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8780.58s)]
*  Zuckerberg's is very cartoony, very kids kind of feeling. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8783.66s)]
*  But is that for all of them [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8787.98s)]
*  or just different software applications? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8789.5s)]
*  Well, like you could play this on the headset, you know, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8791.18s)]
*  but the metaverse is the Facebook, [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8793.54s)]
*  like they're trying to get you into that metaverse world [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8796.9s)]
*  and that's what's failing. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8799.22s)]
*  But it's other stuff in the metaverse, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8800.1s)]
*  like with those, the Oculus that they have, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8801.74s)]
*  they have these virtual tours. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8805.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but that's not like the metaverse. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8807.42s)]
*  That's like, you can play, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8809.42s)]
*  the headset's just like a computer pretty much. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8812.02s)]
*  So you can download anything on it, you know, or. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8813.78s)]
*  So the metaverse is like a walled garden. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8817.300000000001s)]
*  Metaverse is like what we were just watching VRChat [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8819.94s)]
*  where it's kind of like a chat, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8822.26s)]
*  get together with your friends. That's the real metaverse. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8823.58s)]
*  But what Zuckerberg was trying to do, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8825.26s)]
*  you're saying is like a walled garden, [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8827.02s)]
*  like they were making it very specific to these apps, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8829.1s)]
*  they were gonna have these kind of cartoony things. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8832.86s)]
*  Right, the metaverse is doing it through [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8835.18s)]
*  all these characters and stuff like that. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8840.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8843.66s)]
*  It's so hard to explain because it's, [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8844.86s)]
*  they made it confusing as fuck, you know? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8847.98s)]
*  But if anybody can't explain, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8850.380000000001s)]
*  if you can't explain it, nobody can explain it. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8851.5s)]
*  Right, that's a lot of the problem, you know? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8853.02s)]
*  It's VR's taking off, the metaverse is just not taking off [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8856.58s)]
*  because Facebook wants you to live inside their world. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8860.5s)]
*  And it's a world that they create though. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8864.22s)]
*  So that's what I mean by a walled garden. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8866.82s)]
*  So it's all their stuff. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8868.78s)]
*  And it's also very stylistic. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8870.26s)]
*  I kind of feel like if, I've been having the problem, [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8871.98s)]
*  if I haven't come across anything yet [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8873.94s)]
*  that like Brian and I couldn't explain or show you [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8875.98s)]
*  in less than three minutes, [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8878.02s)]
*  then they haven't fucking figured it out yet. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8879.1s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8880.34s)]
*  And they're like, we're not there yet. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8881.18s)]
*  So I'm like, I don't know. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8882.86s)]
*  It seems close, but it seemed close for four years. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8884.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8887.66s)]
*  Like with every iteration of the virtual reality world, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8888.5s)]
*  it's like, this is gonna be it, but it's nah, it's not. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8892.300000000001s)]
*  I don't know how much the pandemic [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8894.86s)]
*  would have slowed down production. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8896.060000000001s)]
*  I feel like it did fuck up some stuff. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8897.140000000001s)]
*  While they were all working in offices, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8898.78s)]
*  doing stuff, messing with these headsets. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8900.02s)]
*  Cause they have shown some behind, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8901.34s)]
*  like there's a video of Zuckerberg has, [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8903.18s)]
*  I think on 60 minutes, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8905.58s)]
*  they were showing someone behind the scenes [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8906.54s)]
*  prototype headsets. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8908.02s)]
*  They have a thing that sticks out from the head, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8909.54s)]
*  like the eye area. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8912.1s)]
*  It's ultrasonic sound waves [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8913.5s)]
*  that are pointed at your mouth. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8916.22s)]
*  And the lady that they had tried, maybe it was a guy, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8918.06s)]
*  they said they could feel raindrops on their mouth. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8920.58s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8923.54s)]
*  And that was recreated with sound waves, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8924.38s)]
*  physically touching you. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8926.82s)]
*  But that's not anything they have commercially available. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8929.22s)]
*  It's just like an in-house demo. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8931.1s)]
*  And that sounds fucking cool too. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8933.66s)]
*  It seems like it's the neural link. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8935.5s)]
*  It seems like it's some sort of neural interface. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8937.5s)]
*  When that hits, then all this shit's gonna make sense. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8939.46s)]
*  And that's even scarier because you don't know [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8943.02s)]
*  what you're seeing is real or not. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8945.220000000001s)]
*  That's a sci-fi movie shit. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8947.02s)]
*  You're gonna walk right off the top of a building. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8948.460000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8950.1s)]
*  You get hacked somehow or trolled [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8951.34s)]
*  and you go into traffic. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8953.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8955.94s)]
*  That's scary as fuck. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8957.74s)]
*  Well, the future is always gonna be scary [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8959.140000000001s)]
*  when it comes to things like this. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8961.82s)]
*  Just technology in general, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8963.74s)]
*  there's gonna be some mistakes. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8965.1s)]
*  There's also a new Black Mirror episode's coming [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8966.7s)]
*  that are gonna probably scare us all somewhere. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8968.66s)]
*  Yeah, can't wait. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8971.02s)]
*  I haven't watched it. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8973.619999999999s)]
*  All the ones that exist. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8974.46s)]
*  Shame. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8975.699999999999s)]
*  I can't get anybody to watch them with me. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8976.699999999999s)]
*  I have to watch them by myself. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8977.94s)]
*  You come over, Joe, come over. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8979.3s)]
*  No, sorry. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8980.9s)]
*  I gotta truck out to the woods. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8981.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8985.74s)]
*  Are you gonna move closer or anything? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8986.98s)]
*  I think I might get a studio apartment downtown or something. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8988.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8991.74s)]
*  Just because there's just, why not? [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8992.58s)]
*  Just have a nice little studio. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8995.1s)]
*  And friends in town, they could use it. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=8997.42s)]
*  But then I could also, hey, it's two in the morning. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9000.300000000001s)]
*  Might as well just stay here, [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9002.34s)]
*  have to be here tomorrow. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9003.18s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people love that. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9004.94s)]
*  Tony loves living down there. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9007.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9009.42s)]
*  He loves it. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9010.26s)]
*  I don't know if I wanna live there all the time, though. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9011.1s)]
*  Some people love that urban sort of experience. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9013.62s)]
*  Yeah, not me. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9016.62s)]
*  You've always been a suburb guy. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9017.460000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9018.5s)]
*  My neighborhood's so quiet. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9019.460000000001s)]
*  Everyone's working. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9021.22s)]
*  At nine o'clock, it's pitch black. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9023.14s)]
*  It's quiet and pitch black. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9025.34s)]
*  I could just go out there and hear nothing except animals. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9027.1s)]
*  I like that. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9031.1s)]
*  Me too. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9031.94s)]
*  I think living in the city is probably fun. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9032.78s)]
*  But Tony's like, he just wants to do stand up every day. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9034.34s)]
*  Just wants to just roll out of his place, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9038.02s)]
*  go to Starbucks, get a coffee. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9040.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9042.300000000001s)]
*  Some people are like that. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9043.14s)]
*  I'm more, I like relaxation and peaceful. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9045.02s)]
*  Every time I go to New York City, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9047.62s)]
*  I always imagine, could I live here? [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9048.78s)]
*  And he's like, I don't think I would like it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9050.5s)]
*  I could never live there. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9051.94s)]
*  Some people, that's the only thing they love. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9053.380000000001s)]
*  They love it more than anything. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9055.42s)]
*  They love Ari. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9056.66s)]
*  He loves the energy. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9057.74s)]
*  He loves being around all the people. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9059.060000000001s)]
*  I also don't like living in buildings. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9061.02s)]
*  Like, you know, like when you live in like [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9063.02s)]
*  a tall building and stuff. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9064.740000000002s)]
*  I don't like that feeling, you know? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9066.060000000001s)]
*  Fire. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9067.86s)]
*  Burning inferno. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9068.7s)]
*  The time when we were in the hotel fire. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9069.86s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9072.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9073.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9074.5s)]
*  Fuck that shit. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9075.34s)]
*  Fuck that shit. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9076.18s)]
*  That's a scary moment. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9077.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9078.42s)]
*  When people are walking too slow down the stairs [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9079.26s)]
*  and you're just ready to go over the top [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9081.18s)]
*  of these motherfuckers. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9082.58s)]
*  Dude, I was panicking. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9083.58s)]
*  Yeah, you should be. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9084.86s)]
*  And remember we went down to like the second floor [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9085.78s)]
*  and we saw all that smoke [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9087.5s)]
*  and it was just the fire extinguisher or something? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9088.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9090.46s)]
*  That was weird. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9091.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it was. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9092.14s)]
*  Some jackasses got drunk and set off a fire extinguisher [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9092.98s)]
*  and they had to get everybody out [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9095.46s)]
*  of the entire fucking building. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9098.38s)]
*  And show ideas. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9099.46s)]
*  I took the elevator, dog, I don't care. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9100.3s)]
*  Like a doctor. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9101.74s)]
*  Like a doctor. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9103.06s)]
*  I would probably take an elevator too. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9104.86s)]
*  Probably doesn't seem like the worst idea [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9107.34s)]
*  as long as the power doesn't go out. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9109.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9110.42s)]
*  It seems like that's some kind of myth [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9111.82s)]
*  that they don't want everyone to pile [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9113.42s)]
*  into the elevator or something. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9114.7s)]
*  Or. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9116.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9117.619999999999s)]
*  You get stuck there if you lose power or something. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9118.78s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to get stuck. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9121.22s)]
*  You don't want to get stuck in the elevator [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9122.539999999999s)]
*  if it loses power. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9123.74s)]
*  That makes the most sense. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9124.94s)]
*  And then the building's on fire. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9126.78s)]
*  You can't get out. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9128.3s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9129.26s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's it. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9130.58s)]
*  Did you see the video of the elevator, [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9133.9s)]
*  the counterweight fucked up? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9135.34s)]
*  No. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9138.1s)]
*  And you know instead of going down [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9138.94s)]
*  like a lot of elevators you're afraid of, [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9139.76s)]
*  it fucking went up at a high speed. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9141.46s)]
*  Show the video. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9144.46s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9145.3s)]
*  I hate elevators. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9146.22s)]
*  Even the elevator at the mothership [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9147.06s)]
*  are refused to go in it. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9148.22s)]
*  It's very slow. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9149.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, even if it's any kind of elevator. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9149.9s)]
*  The elevator at the mothership is so slow [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9152.9s)]
*  it seems broken. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9154.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9155.26s)]
*  Have you got that shit checked? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9156.1s)]
*  Maybe it's. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9157.18s)]
*  We did. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9158.019999999999s)]
*  It's totally replaced. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9158.859999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9161.14s)]
*  This is eight years old. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9161.98s)]
*  I don't know if this is. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9162.82s)]
*  I think it is. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9163.66s)]
*  It was an old video. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9164.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9165.34s)]
*  It just went viral again. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9166.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9167.019999999999s)]
*  It gets on it and look, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9169.58s)]
*  it's just fucking going out of control. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9170.42s)]
*  Cause it goes up 30 floors in 15 seconds. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9172.900000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9176.140000000001s)]
*  There's no sound. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9177.26s)]
*  Show the crazy part. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9179.460000000001s)]
*  That would freak me the fuck out. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9181.62s)]
*  Oh, and then they don't show it. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9183.82s)]
*  What was the crazy part? [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9185.5s)]
*  Oh, the, like you see it crash. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9186.34s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9188.86s)]
*  It's flying up. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9189.7s)]
*  They're not gonna show the crash part? [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9190.54s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9191.380000000001s)]
*  Ah! [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9192.220000000001s)]
*  They're going around. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9193.060000000001s)]
*  They see you can't handle it. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9193.900000000001s)]
*  There's another one. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9194.720000000001s)]
*  There's another one. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9195.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9196.400000000001s)]
*  Skip ahead. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9198.220000000001s)]
*  Boom. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9200.34s)]
*  Oh. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9201.18s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9202.02s)]
*  So it gets all the way to the top and he gets, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9203.86s)]
*  oh shit, he got wrecked. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9206.060000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9207.54s)]
*  Is that guy alive? [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9208.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9209.74s)]
*  This has been going around. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9210.58s)]
*  There's a lot of people standing near trains. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9211.400000000001s)]
*  I've been seeing they're like walking next to a train. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9212.78s)]
*  They just get jacked by the train. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9214.94s)]
*  Like they're walking too close to it. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9216.18s)]
*  For social media posts they're saying. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9217.54s)]
*  Look how the door opened, [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9219.1s)]
*  but the elevator's still moving. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9220.26s)]
*  Fuck, bro. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9221.66s)]
*  No. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9223.62s)]
*  I wouldn't even know what to do. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9225.7s)]
*  I would probably lay on the ground. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9227.82s)]
*  What can you do? [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9229.02s)]
*  Boom. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9229.900000000001s)]
*  When you hit the top, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9230.74s)]
*  that dude must be dead. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9231.58s)]
*  So I've never seen that happen before. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9234.42s)]
*  That scared the shit out of me after I saw it. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9235.539999999999s)]
*  Elevators are fucking terrifying. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9236.94s)]
*  I hate it. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9238.26s)]
*  So are escalators. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9239.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9239.94s)]
*  People fall through and get chewed up by the gears. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9240.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9242.18s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9243.02s)]
*  But then that one video came out [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9244.14s)]
*  of the woman falling through. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9245.42s)]
*  Oh. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9246.78s)]
*  That's why regulations are important, kids. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9247.94s)]
*  You need regulators. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9250.7s)]
*  When it comes to that kind of shit, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9252.58s)]
*  you need inspectors. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9254.42s)]

*  Blue Sky is what I'm trying to get an invitation code. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9321.14s)]
*  Hey, Zach? [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9323.619999999999s)]
*  That's the Dorsey one. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9324.46s)]
*  Oh, no, no, yeah. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9325.38s)]

*  Give me that invitation code. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9328.019999999999s)]
*  What are they doing with Blue Sky? [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9329.539999999999s)]
*  Blue Sky is Twitter. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9331.5s)]
*  Have you seen the screenshots of it? [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9333.9s)]
*  It looks just like Twitter. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9335.26s)]
*  Does it? [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9336.9s)]
*  And I'm down, I'm down, yeah. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9337.74s)]
*  I'm down. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9338.859999999999s)]
*  I like Jack. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9339.9s)]
*  What is he doing differently with it? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9340.74s)]
*  I don't think there's anything different. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9342.82s)]
*  I think he pretty much just. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9344.42s)]
*  It's the way the backend works. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9345.82s)]
*  Remember how someone was just sitting here [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9347.42s)]
*  explaining that you could take all of your shit with you? [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9349.3s)]
*  I forget, maybe on my. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9351.779999999999s)]
*  Adam Curry? [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9352.619999999999s)]
*  No, Bill Otman was to explain about some of that [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9353.46s)]
*  whole backend stuff that was way over my head. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9356.019999999999s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9358.099999999999s)]
*  They have an ability to take all your content with you [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9358.939999999999s)]
*  if you want to leave. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9360.74s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9361.9s)]
*  Trying to find a picture of it, [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9362.939999999999s)]
*  but it's not showing on there. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9363.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's supposedly. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9365.58s)]
*  Some sort of decentralized, uncensored version of it. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9366.98s)]
*  Yeah, see, it looks exactly like it. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9371.779999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, that's Twitter. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9373.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9374.099999999999s)]
*  It even has a repost thing. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9374.939999999999s)]
*  The graphics are the same. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9377.179999999998s)]
*  I think Jack changed his tune on Elon, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9379.699999999999s)]
*  and I think that's why he's doing this. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9383.66s)]
*  Really? [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9385.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9386.26s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people soured on Elon. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9387.98s)]
*  He announced yesterday that Twitter's DMs [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9389.82s)]
*  are gonna turn encrypted starting today or something. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9391.619999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9394.42s)]
*  So no one, not even I could see it [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9395.26s)]
*  if there was a gun to my head. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9396.94s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9398.18s)]
*  And that's something about phone calls and all sorts of stuff. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9399.38s)]
*  Or he's a friend. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9400.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9402.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9402.94s)]
*  It's a trap. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9404.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9405.859999999999s)]
*  I don't think he's a friend. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9406.699999999999s)]
*  I think he's an alien. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9407.539999999999s)]
*  If anything. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9409.22s)]
*  All right, that's it. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivpri7bA0ls&t=9410.06s)]
