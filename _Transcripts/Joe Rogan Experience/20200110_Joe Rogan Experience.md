# Joe Rogan Experience - Fight Companion - January 9, 2020
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM5IYSZeGCY)
*  Yeah, happy new year friends happy new year
*  Good to see you Brian counts allegedly on the way. We've got all kinds of libations here and
*  What the fuck were we just talking about? I said save it. I said don't say oh or two bodies
*  What do they do with the bodies? There was something before that mines fields sides of Paris knows even before that
*  Meat carnivore diet. Oh, okay. Maybe it's that yeah, so I'm ten days in I think something like that
*  Today's the ninth so I'm 11 days in I started a couple of days before and I've been eating nothing but meat bacon steak
*  Elk meat a lot of extra fat if I eat the elk meat. How's that cholesterol son? I don't know I got my blood work done
*  Last Monday, I'll get the results back soon
*  And then I'm gonna do it again at the end of the month, but I've already lost seven pounds you feel good
*  I feel you look good when he came out the guys looking tight
*  Boys, they lost my belly. I had a gut. I was getting a gun
*  This is where I get fat instantly right here. It goes right here, and then it starts pushing out
*  I think all dudes do right. I don't know some people get in their face
*  I get in my face to I feel it in my face when I'm washing my face my hell. Yeah small
*  I get in both yeah, but that's where they you feel your face like damn my face
*  You know the shape of your face from you wash your face every day so you get in there
*  You're like oh, this is like less face. Also a fat face is a bummer. It's a bummer
*  Yeah, I'm fat I've been ever like 190 right now Jesus. Yeah, but here's the thing that's good about it
*  I'll tell you what's bad about it first diarrhea is rough and eating only steak. It's boring
*  I like diarrhea, but the kind of diarrhea that I'm talking about is like
*  Confusive it's like you gotta run like you do not trust your butthole. It's like you know
*  It's not telling you until the first door
*  It's not seeing the fire in the horizon and warning you to get to the bathroom
*  It's like the fire is at its making your doorknob hot
*  What if you're what if you're starving you're far from home, and there's a Burger King, and that's it
*  There's a Burger King for I just order four whoppers, and then I'll take the meat out of them
*  I'll just eat the meat okay
*  Yeah, I'm gonna do it for the whole month. I had an olive. I guess I cheated a little I had all of
*  Yeah, you know I've had a glass of wine here and there and I guess that's you know
*  But that's just drinking why did you decide to do it?
*  I want to see what's up because I know a lot of people that I respect that have tried like Jordan Peterson in particular
*  That guy's a fucking genius and when he's telling me what a massive impact. It's had on them cognitively
*  He said that intellectually he's at his prime
*  He said all of his immune system autoimmune issues went away, and I that's vitiligo is an autoimmune issue
*  So I'm seeing what happens with that too, but that doesn't really spreading any but with him
*  He was having gum issues or receding gums that went away his gums actually came back in his daughter
*  She was daughter sick, too. That's why they started it. She's got serious
*  Arthritis like really bad, but it helped it right you see this is what it is
*  It's an elimination diet so instead of your diet breaking down a bunch of different things
*  It's just breaking down one thing and this one thing that human beings have been eating since the beginning of time
*  Like this idea that human beings are herbivores is pretty much nonsense one of the main reasons why we became what we are
*  They think is because we started eating meat
*  We started getting better access to protein from cooking it because we figured out how to harness fire and then through hunting we started getting
*  More devious and started you know thinking and having better critical skills and then eating mushrooms
*  I think all those things this is but that's just my taking supplements though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to write like in every no
*  I wouldn't you think you have any fans that are vegan. Yeah
*  Yeah, cuz I have a couple vegan students that
*  Man one said I don't listen to Jerry no more. Hey, he talks too much about meat
*  Too much about me, that's that's your trigger
*  It's Mexican Mexican
*  95 to 97 percent of the population of the planet earth eats meat
*  This is what vegans are is very loud and very vocal
*  You know, but they want to make it look like this is massive movement like no it's I don't know
*  You know
*  What your body feels like when you eat things everybody's body is different everybody's body
*  Reacts to nutrients different stuff for processed foods. We can all agree that's not good for anybody
*  Yeah process sugar all bad for everyone
*  The reason why people are so fucking fat the reason why everyone's so fat is carbohydrates and fat and sugar and all of it mixed up
*  Together and massive portions and sedentary lifestyle. There's a bunch of factors. So I've killed a bunch of those factors, right?
*  I killed a sedentary lifestyle. I exercise a lot
*  I and then I killed most of the sugar most of the bullshit and then
*  Before I went on this diet. I had gotten off the rails a little bit too many too many carbs too much pasta
*  I was eating like fucking subs. Yeah, I fell off hard. You wrote a dance super subs. No, oh
*  Inventor oh really? Oh hell yeah. Oh, you gotta get my giant you gotta get the giant pastrami the giant pastrami
*  Holy shit is it good and it's all bread
*  fatty pastrami and look man
*  That's a lot of calories like you're gonna run some cam Hanes tile type miles to burn off that shit
*  But so all the different things that could fuck with your health and all the different things they make what makes you feel good
*  What makes you feel bad depending upon your biology your lifestyle? I'm experimenting, you know
*  Yeah, so this is my experiment for the month just me for the month so far. This is the most amazing thing
*  I would just go sorry energy levels like this straight. There's no
*  Carbs insulin there's no carbs. There's no carbs. I'm not having any carbs. Yeah, I'm saying before you're probably eating carbs
*  There's some form of carb. Yeah, you're sure spike in your days like this dude. I would love I love pasta
*  I'm so bad. I would make like elk sausage and a big bowl of spaghetti. It's so nice
*  It's so good in the moment, but afterwards like the amount of time that it feels good versus the amount of time
*  It doesn't feel good. It's so massive. I hate myself after I hate myself the amount of time
*  It feels good. It's like five minutes, but goddamn. That's a good five. It's a good great
*  It fucks with your whole it's so nice like think of the thing of it this way
*  How often would you want to get laid if every time you got laid you gained 20 pounds?
*  You believe every time I'm getting laid. I just keep me in fat once a month then once a month
*  Just ride it out at the end of the month drop that weight down again start looking fresh get laid
*  Jerking off do you gain like five pounds? No, you don't get anything jerking off. I would have to see her your boy might get
*  She's willing to fuck you while you're fat
*  That's a special girl special girl doesn't get turned off at all by your big fat gut
*  Don't give a fuck doesn't care if you know they're out there. They're out there. They're out there
*  Shall we chase this bro, so I this is obviously the Goldilocks period you know like it's
*  You're also it's a honeymoon right? I just started and you're into it. I don't know. I don't know what this is
*  I think you don't know usually about like 13 days in that's where people break. We're like fuck this dude
*  Or I'm not feeling great. It was really boring about five days in but like I said now today the ninth
*  So today's 11th day in today was no problem. I know what I'm doing my biggest issue
*  I put on weight especially in December was
*  The road because I go to do it wherever I go Philly. It's cheesesteaks or New York. It's pizza
*  It's just it's just you know it's gonna be more discipline. It's late, too
*  Cuz you know you get that at 1 2 a.m.. Yep. Yep. I got figured out. Yeah
*  People did eat like this though
*  There's human beings that have eaten like this for long periods of time like the idea that they didn't is crazy like
*  Inuits eat like this
*  Native Americans that Comanche's ate like this Comanche's barely ate anything other than buffalo
*  Have you ever seen a Comanche my god damn on it looked like that well
*  They're all dead Brendan or that's what I'm saying dude. Yeah, but that's because of never properties
*  But you were probably a shredded as fuck
*  Well, there's a dentists being shredded and malnourished Eddie well some of them were giant
*  It's like some of them were not necessarily malnourished
*  I mean in the in occasional bouts of famine they were but for the most part they were following the buffalo every case
*  I mean we could shred city though. You know I'm saying maybe like there's no fat cavemen no fat Indians right right
*  They didn't have a chance to get fat
*  Once the once the settlers moved in though, and they started living on reservations and getting white man food
*  They all got fat. I'm reading this book about it now
*  They didn't know what to do with flour, so they would just try to eat it
*  They didn't know how to cook it so they would just try to either fucking starving when the
*  the white men tick over and
*  Push push to Navajo in the reservations, and we sneeze down like took out all of bro 90% of them dead
*  But you dad yeah, I'm reading this account. I mean this it's horrific this does they set up this reservation and everybody got syphilis
*  everybody
*  Everybody's banging everybody and they all got syphilis and people's hairs falling out
*  They have ulcers all over their body and people are going crazy and dying
*  Fuck man they can solve syphilis now today. Yeah good now Al Capone dad
*  Are you anti vaccination motherfuckers you need to pay attention to syphilis?
*  polio
*  Smallpox gotta be right there's a not for kids. There's a hep C made for kids. What is that with the?
*  HPV HPV yeah, they have a vaccination yeah now they have vaccination for everything now
*  But um can be a problem dude back then the living that's only 150 years ago live in those days catching diseases
*  They didn't know what it was people just start dying and no idea black plague no
*  I see ya like who knows how much of all that shit is a career
*  You know history is just so full of deception like what if what if like what if like hell?
*  Yeah, jealous white people would just say like he's saying hell. Yeah, cuz you're getting into conspiracies
*  The top of my hat what is the top of now what if what if all that shit
*  All the Indians had syphilis were like jealous white they're not the Indians everybody the soldiers had syphilis everyone
*  You don't want to fuck them meanwhile the white chicks wanted to fuck the Indians
*  It's a slow story of a disastrous idea by this general Carlton guy who wanted these guys to move into
*  This area he wanted to move off the reservations in New Mexico
*  And they had this area set aside for them, but they cut down all the trees for firewood
*  They started running out of food. They start too many people were coming in
*  They took away all their guns and the Comanches found them so the Comanches were attacking the Navajo damn dude
*  It's it's it's horrific you're reading this
*  I mean even though I'd have it 150 years ago my hands are sweating like these people are fucked
*  They're surrounded by thousands of hostile Indians. They're just kidnapping their kids
*  Raping their women killing people taking away all their horses, and there's like a sitting duck on this reservation
*  Dude the fucking the shit people had to go through just a person look in the world
*  It's horrific, but if without it. You know you wouldn't be able to just fly into Albuquerque and go to Jackson's true
*  Native Americans try to kill you or fly into Jeffrey Epstein's ranch in
*  Albuquerque you know he has a ranch there not only does he have a writer
*  But he's got a mile away. He actually owns a Western world like it's like Westworld
*  Yeah, and dude six
*  The leads the elites that's where they hang out Jeffrey Jeffrey Epstein's
*  Western town in Albuquerque in Albuquerque 60 minutes had a piece I
*  How the the the suicide is fake 60 minutes? Did you see in his like little cell?
*  There's like ten different freaking outfit jumpsuits. There's a cord. There's a pen
*  Yeah, it's nuts and his brother's the one who hired this outside lawyer and the Lord's like I know it
*  It looks like I'm here to be like oh no
*  He did I'm telling you look at all this stuff like here's the Michael Baden guy that guy from the HBO autopsy series
*  I mean that guy has done thousands of autopsies, and he's a real expert
*  He's like I've never seen anyone who was who hung themselves with injuries like this
*  Especially where the marks at who knows who knows if if that's all just a distraction to like get people arguing make it so obvious
*  That it was it wasn't a suicide. It's so obvious. Let's release it make it so obvious meanwhile
*  He's still alive and everyone's trying to figure out how he died and all they care about is that he's dead
*  You think he's dead anything is playing that 3d chess
*  He's one step ahead of us. That's why so good. Why would they have why?
*  Fucking triangle on there first
*  There's virtually a media blackout on it for the longest time
*  But they gotta talk about something because the longer the mainstream media doesn't talk about it the more obvious it looks and it's waking
*  Everybody up you know how many people who are super anti conspiracy theorists are all into Epstein now
*  It's like when 9-eleven happened that woke up a lot of people 9-eleven woke people up a lot of people say well
*  It started with 9-eleven a lot of shits gonna people gonna say it started with Jeffrey Epstein because it's so obvious
*  And seen even my dad's obvious. What are we doing like come on? We're seeing now Michael Shermer
*  Michael Shermer is calling it a conspiracy everybody people that hate conspiracy theories are all into it. They're all Michael Shermer
*  I'm so balls deep and
*  There's a guy on YouTube who every day he puts out all he does is he's written books on gangsters and all that every day
*  He puts out a Epstein video an update and he just goes deeper and deeper and deeper his name is Sean
*  Atwood what's the update of a day though dude?
*  We're taking two hours to to go into it's really all about
*  Ghislaine Maxwell's father
*  He was the one who was originally doing what Epstein was doing
*  Epstein took so Epstein started banging Ghislaine
*  She takes him she goes you know what you're gonna take over the family business the family business is
*  It's not just blackmailing the elite that's part of it, but the man a big part of it
*  Dude it her father. He's the one Robert Maxwell that guy was a dude he worked
*  I love this shit. I don't know like I'm afraid to talk about this shit
*  Sean Atwood okay, well go to that guy's page. Oh, it's
*  It's the first conspiracy in modern times where everyone is like no way
*  JFK so no no JFK there's still people to this day that think that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK a lot of them
*  Including people that have written like good. What is that?
*  That guy's name wrote case closed
*  William
*  whatever
*  There's there's been a lot of credible people to think that Oswald acted alone. I don't think so crazy. I don't think so
*  But this one the first Epstein they happen all the time no one's defending it
*  No one's saying no one's coming out defend it the government's just silent
*  I think I think there's a good chance that he's alive. I think I think that's crazy. That's where I think they're just
*  Oh, it wasn't a suicide one him to be alive. It's even more fun if we're in Europe like
*  It's already crazy as fuck the amount of deception that were that's shoved down our throats which obvious now
*  It's all out in the open so any plausible theory you can't laugh at
*  He's a good easily he's in Thailand right now totally bandages all over his face watching TV
*  Hospital exactly full facial reconstruction surgery. Yeah
*  Yeah, why did they need to show 9,000 jumpsuits shit like
*  It's getting there dude, it's so obvious it's obvious it's too obvious
*  I'm with Eddie. I'm the most obvious one of all time look at all those come on man
*  How about 2020 showed his dad's body on TV the craziest thing the craziest thing besides all that the craziest thing is like
*  Where's the video footage? Oh the cameras weren't well? No no you see that's the craziest
*  You know see the new video footage the new video footage was accidentally erased. That's insane
*  The first video that on purpose video from Jeffrey Liepstein suicide attempt is gone jail officials inadvertently
*  Preserved footage from wrong floor
*  Hey government if you're gonna kill someone do better though
*  If you were part of this this
*  This network of like elite people right like he's definitely he definitely has a lot of power right?
*  Yeah, wouldn't you wouldn't there be like wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to all get together and say listen every now
*  And then some dudes gonna
*  We're gonna have to sacrifice one of you guys and just fake your death
*  And you're gonna have to go to one of the islands in Japan or one of them
*  Probably have so many spots set up wouldn't it be smart go set up some spots and in like the Greek islands or somewhere like
*  Often or the coast of Norway Greenland Greenland could who knows what's in Greenland they could have all these cities for
*  Like all these people that like they die, but you never see their bodies
*  They could just say you know they people used to fake their deaths all the time back in the 30s 40s
*  Easier just kill upstein way easier way
*  Especially when he's in the cell. You don't think he has you don't think he has a kill switch
*  You don't think that dude did I think he probably does you know dude, man?
*  I wish I could tell you that's why just saying Maxwell's alive. You can't tell us. It's just it's dark, dude
*  This is the stuff I like going to start Eddie
*  I'll tell you guys about this out, but okay Sean Atwood that that guy. Holy shit
*  He's he's he's dug in so deep like so deep like the neighbor that the property
*  That's right next to the one in Manhattan that Les Wexner gave him for zero dollars
*  Hey, man, that's a nice person. It's good friend gives you a 70
*  You know what that people people always jump on that but that's not that crazy because back in the 80s apparently for like Sean
*  Atwood saying that that's not that crazy because people used to do that all the time to save on taxes
*  So that ain't a big deal. Maybe
*  Epstein did pay him whatever it was worth. You know
*  They would often do that just say it's zero. It's not the craziest. It's not the crazy thing, but
*  Then the property next to that mansion the history of that shit
*  Damn, I wish you could go over that man. It's crazy
*  Epstein has been involved in intelligence for a very long time very long time
*  Long like as long as the Iran Contra scandal. Remember that a lot of drugs coming in helping
*  It's like all this illegal black ops George senior was the main El Patron
*  Epstein wasn't was one of the workers that he wasn't so he was girls in hiding right Eddie because they said she was a
*  CIA informant she's like
*  The mainstream Maxwell. Yes, she was the main one. Yeah, she brought Epstein into the operation
*  She was the Epstein took over for her father Robert Maxwell. That's what's going on
*  She's more powerful than Epstein and they can't find her. No, you won't touch her. They're not gonna touch her
*  Yeah, the kill switch she's in touch with people it only makes sense
*  She did there her father was the master of blackmailing people. That's what he did
*  Yeah, just just give me an idea what that place was next door
*  It's just when you go through the owners like there's like there's so see the thing what's going on
*  Now is the biggest phenomena that's going on right now is with the internet. The internet is like
*  Backfiring and it's boomerang and back at the people it wasn't the internet was intended to control us and
*  Surveil us and now
*  The internet was intended for scientists to share information at universities
*  It was in the universities that's your when you look at
*  Didn't have to like all each other and send packages in the mail
*  No, well, that could be one of the reason the internet was
*  The people that invented the internet why they invented
*  There were it was all funded by the CIA. It was all the way to keep it's always about the New World Order
*  It's always about the easiest way to control us. That's all so
*  Okay, there's this give me a sign. There's this software
*  It's gonna Robert Maxwell deep Robert Maxwell. Just Lane's father
*  one of his jobs
*  Was man. I don't even I should talk about this shit. I'm not gonna talk
*  We don't we don't I don't know what you're reading
*  I was reading something that I was I'm writing this bit about a real thing that happened with the CIA in the 1950s and
*  it's called operation of midnight climax and
*  You know MK ultra Eddie knows that is my control experience from the experiments from the CIA
*  They had six percent of the CIA's budget and there was no
*  No oversight they could spend it on whatever they wanted and what they were doing is just
*  Dosing the fuck out of people with LSD they dose this one guy 77 days in a row
*  She's and they ran out of people that were willing to do it
*  A lot of times it was college students like that's how they toasted the Unabomber
*  That's where mancy came from well a lot of these people they cooked their brain with acid well
*  They did that with they ran out of people so they started opening up brothels
*  So they open up whorehouses and they call it operation midnight climax
*  So they would hire hookers and the hookers would dose these guys up
*  They've given a drink that was filled with acid and then fuck them and then fuck them on film
*  How much did they charge? What a great dick?
*  Sex
*  And so they would film it through like two-way glass Wow yeah, and so they're they're sitting there their whole
*  budget was being spent on
*  Dosing guys and watching guys fuck fantastic. It's hilarious USA
*  I mean they did it for a lot CIA chief deplores CIA brothels. What year is this that looks like?
*  1952
*  I was reading a book on this stuff and when they were dosing ruin the LSD and acid on stuff in
*  Hey, Dashberry in San Francisco. That's where Manson came up the whole family came out there
*  So that was Steve with the CIA and stuff okay, so and my right ears ago it ended 12 years ago with studying telling you, bro
*  They're all past history Turner said in San Francisco the CIA
*  So the CIA had said that was terrible, and that's past history. We don't do that anymore. It's been 12 years
*  They bring a bullshit point. We're bringing a bullshit. This is just the tip of the iceberg
*  We can go on for five hours with this shit
*  It's almost like the CIA was created as a scapegoat like all because the CIA ain't going to jail
*  Where this how do you put CIA in jail you can't and then the directors are only there temporarily
*  Out everyone like goes through it, but it's a read like if you find out some evil shit's going on
*  See I did it saying going to jail
*  Everyone says the CIA is nefarious and you know doing all this crazy shit
*  And he's one step ahead of us on those dude every time catches the triangle. That's all I do baby
*  That's all I did is all you do. I know you would love this
*  I'm reading a book now where say hired two mafia guys to assassinate Castro
*  It's a legit, but it was legit like plot. Yes whole plot
*  Sling it's like 635
*  Tries on his life. Yeah amazing. That's a beast something like he died of old age. Yeah, he's right
*  He even came to New York. Yeah, and they still couldn't do shit, too
*  Yeah, that was before they really turned on him because at first the United States was backing him
*  Yep, and then they're back a week having it and then something happened. They switch. There's a lot of different theories like maybe
*  He was working for that like Fidel Castro was
*  part of a CIA operation to overthrow the Batista regime maybe or
*  And then like once he got in he said fuck the CIA fuck the United States and CIA goes, okay
*  We got to kill this motherfucker a lot a lot of times that happens people turn
*  You know what I mean? So like the Kennedy's terms on bin Laden because kick the Kennedy's come from a crime family
*  The mom put credit in their dad. Yeah, something happened between
*  Robert and John where they were you know, that was his attorney general. That's who he hired
*  So once they got together something happened and made them flip some people say that JFK
*  I don't know if it's true or not like his son died at an early age
*  Just one of his kids died and that from that point on he decided to do the right thing and just say fuck it
*  So him and Robert him and Robert knew they were gonna get killed like they would talk about it
*  They knew they were gonna get killed for doing what they're doing
*  But they're just gonna go out with their boots on you know what I mean? That's a theory
*  I don't know. Maybe one crazy dude did it
*  Isn't history great though like to have all this stuff and go through all the different theories
*  I can what's crazy with history is now we can see it before people just told it
*  It wasn't until like the 20th century that really people saw it
*  Yeah before that it was just people telling stories about stuff knows what's like from the 17 hundreds
*  They do the best to be together from multiple accounts, but it's really hard
*  That's the Bible in it. Oh the Bible's even worse the Bible's I mean
*  Bunch of stories, but not just that a bunch of stories translated
*  For sure it got translated and all that shit with the Bible, but for sure I am in my heart
*  I'm a hundred I I believe it a hundred percent that there is some stuff in the Bible
*  That's the real shit there is though it comes from the real shit
*  It got distorted and translated and all that
*  What do you mean by the real shit like like it's a manual on how to live your life, right?
*  You know what I mean if you these are rules like maybe God is the idea
*  Maybe God is the in Jesus is the frequency you want to get in that frequency of life. Don't deceive anybody
*  Don't tell each other each other then you will be in that zone. Yeah, that's what God is
*  The book is a manual it's got to be because there's one thing like I said, I'm balls deep and
*  Trying to find the truth. Sometimes I'm wrong. Whatever truth a lot of guys a lot of guys
*  Three different guys that I looked up to and looked and asked for information because they were so
*  Into a certain area that I wasn't into I'm like tell me more tell me more and they're like my mentors
*  At the end did all of them they're starting to look into the Bible
*  And I remember the first guy back in like 2005 when I was like full-blown like the bug, you know against religion and all that
*  I would say dude. What are you doing, dude?
*  You showed me the way and now you're looking into the Bible goes
*  Sounds crazy, but you got it. You got it. You got to look into it too. There's this isn't just a book with crazy fairy tales
*  This is some real shit
*  Well, I'm like it is and I was a historical account of the times of the people that live back then as best they could tell
*  It translated down over thousands of years
*  So there's some absolute truths in the Bible and there's some great guides to live your life
*  But there's also some nonsense for sure walking on water. It's not just that
*  Ignore the nonsense God's sick two bears on these kids that were making fun as dude for being bald that
*  Jack and Jill stories for sure for sure for sure. That's in there. You have to wonder how much of any of the original men
*  Stories well, if you look at the mainstream history of like Catholicism, I grew up Catholic you did to yeah Catholic Christian Christian
*  Well, I'm brand the mainstream story name a branch Lutheran
*  What's what's the what's the normal one
*  You're agnostic right you're not sure do you just what if I believe there's a God but I don't believe in like Jesus or okay
*  You see when you think about there's a God like what what's the thought that comes through your head?
*  Like what do you think and when you when you say I think there's a God
*  I think there's a higher being do you know a thing that I don't know
*  I don't know. I think I think there's that there's the energy in our body goes somewhere
*  There's something that makes us you know, like I can I can feel certain things like love or intuition stuff like that
*  That has to be something, you know, I think that goes somewhere
*  I don't think there's a heaven in hell Jordan Peterson has some really good advice on that
*  He said whether or not you believe in a God he goes live as if God is real and there's real benefits
*  I think it really if you really do have that kind of gratitude and humility that you're you're being watched over by a loving God
*  Yeah, I think there's a benefit to thinking like it's just about doing the right thing. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's all about how do we get the people to do the right thing?
*  And I believe there's a God because a couple things, you know when when I did DMT I went into I thought okay
*  There's more there's way more shit to this reality this dimension that
*  Out there seeing for sure and then the more the more I get into
*  You know trying to find out what we're on and what what this is all about and then you look at the mainstream
*  I think someone created what we're in whatever you want to whatever you think this is thinks assimilation. This is something
*  I don't I don't believe in simulation. Why don't they believe in simulation?
*  When you think about your kids and shit that month, you know, there's no evidence but
*  But it could be true. It could be but there's but you know
*  Really smart people don't just say I don't go by is there and not only is there evidence?
*  But if you look at probability theory, what was that guy's name? That was
*  The the the guy Nick Bolstrom we talked about it in depth and he said according to probability theory
*  It's more likely that we're in a simulation. Maybe maybe maybe that's true because the fact that's my eyes
*  But that's like a measure in almost inevitable if unless we get disrupted by nature unless we get hit with an asteroid or start a nuclear
*  War it's inevitable the technology reaches a point where simulations possible if you watch Rick and Morty, that's what it is
*  Well, that's if simulation is real then the simulation goes on forever in this space that everyone thinks
*  It could be a part of infinite life computer. It's not that's no, it's not that simple
*  It's like like it could be one of the facets of life
*  Like we could be creating a simulation just through culture and society and that simulation is literally how we enter into another dimension
*  We're looking at it like it's some nonsense thing. I get the simulation
*  Oh, it's just a simply it could literally be how dimensions are created
*  they're created by creativity and ingenuity and
*  Innovation over long periods of time with millions of people working in conjunction
*  Different people figuring out processing power and coding and all these different things and next thing, you know
*  You've got these there's there's these
*  Virtual reality places like we have an oculus out there that you could put on. Yeah, you could do all these games
*  It's really fun, but there's some virtual reality places now that you go into a warehouse and you go through this whole thing
*  You know, there's there's a place that's in Disneyland and there's a another place down the street called sandbox and you play games
*  Oh, there's a there's an arcade is VR arcade at the Westfield Mall. Yeah, Riverside. That's called this one right here parallel universe
*  Yes, but don't you think if we're in a simulation it doesn't you believe we're in a simulation if I was
*  Not riding the head to be wazer for me commit suicide if I just think in this a whole simulation
*  Yeah, I mean it gets dark. There's a lot of variables
*  There's a lot of variables about why should I just do whatever I want to just simulation simulation doesn't count
*  I don't think it's that simple. I think all the rules apply
*  I think what they're trying to say is if human beings keep going we definitely will create a simulation
*  It's just a matter of time
*  So if that's the case, how do we know that we're not in one already and we really don't every day
*  We go to sleep and every day we wake up and we assume and we have faith
*  That all that stuff that we remember is really how life went on before we were awake
*  But we really don't know really you don't when you black out and then come back to who the fuck knows what's transpiring
*  Who knows where your consciousness goes? Who knows where you are?
*  You're gone eight hours seems like a second all sudden you're foggy a couple minutes to wake up and boom
*  Where's that time go? Where are you? Who are you?
*  You're assuming that all of the stuff that you know and all the stuff that you experience is a hundred percent real
*  But what if it is real?
*  What do you mean if the simulation is real? No, what simulation isn't real we are on this earth
*  That's a new art down for it. You know when it comes a simulation theory. Yeah, I think that's the odds of that or but
*  I thought but the passing out is a bad example
*  But the good example is that we are within a hundred years away from making something that's indiscernible
*  From what we experience every day and that's inevitable
*  It seems like just how people do it and what I'm saying is that might literally be how your consciousness
*  transforms into whatever next stage of existence there is we might it might be something that human beings do like a
*  Caterpillar makes a cocoon and becomes a butterfly
*  Human beings make crazy fucking technology, and I think that's one of the reasons why we're so invested in materialism
*  Everybody loves things they love shiny things especially the new ones all of you got the newest car
*  It's even faster the newest computer has better graphics issues and as all this stuff as we're paying for newer and better shit
*  It's fueling all this innovation which making crazier and crazier technology until
*  Artificial intelligence until we create something that you can't turn off
*  Well, you already download your consciousness, and you just you just you know you can download into another body
*  Simulation is that what that might be what a simulation is what a simulation might be is that when we open this up with sufficient?
*  Power and technology and processing power whenever you are might go into this thing. That's a bit of a bummer though, right?
*  I don't know when you think about it like let's say when you're a hundred and finally technology there
*  You just download your consciousness into another body. You just keep going
*  Think man. This is it. This is it. We don't go on it's that's depressing as fuck to me
*  It's kind of what's kind of fat. I mean what what are we that's the thing?
*  It's like what the fuck are we when we're thinking and talking when you're thinking of yourself like you?
*  Well, you see when you're using the word I I am going to do this
*  I'm going what does that mean like where are you you're you're this strange being that's got a
*  Finite lifespan, it's not really that long not at all
*  You know I mean Eddie and I are middle-aged motherfuckers if we're lucky you're on the back you're in the back
*  We're in the back nine. I'm almost yeah, and and then you die so what what is going on while you're alive?
*  It's all guesswork man
*  We don't know what this is and everyone is involved in the guesswork from the highest levels of government down to fucking the the poorest people
*  In the world everyone's guessing it's all weird
*  It's all real weird
*  And it's all we're gonna die in the next generation is gonna pick up and the next generation after them is gonna pick up
*  But but life is it because of technology and science you're you know the the average life spans going like this it is but also
*  You you have more information you can look at history you can look at how long we've been here the more they start
*  They just found another asteroid impact from 800,000 years ago. Jesus. They knew we were hit 800,000 years ago
*  But now they've located the crater. It's like
*  The library yes, I watched on YouTube this it's becoming this you know people are realizing like there's there's only been a short amount of time
*  Where human beings have even been human we've only been human for half a million years at the most
*  I'm gonna stop bumping out especially have kids you know it's weird
*  well
*  we if but think about it this way if you were a Neanderthal or you know fucking Australia Pythagos and
*  You know you were told that your species is gonna go extinct you think all the good times you had killing muskrats and cooking them
*  Over the fire with your kids and and hiding from jaguars and shit you think all those good times like this
*  We're not gonna be us anymore
*  You think if this is a computer simulation at what point like when did it start like in?
*  1800s the 1600s
*  200 ad
*  5000 BC
*  When did when was the beginning of this simulation who knows we don't know there's a video game where you create your own worlds
*  Sim City, baby. No no more crazy
*  There's a video game where you literally create a universe to create a planet you put things on it like was that game called
*  You and Jimmy what is it?
*  No, man sky
*  That could be what the universe is I mean the whole thing about the Big Bang
*  Like the Big Bang means that the entire universe is smaller than the head of a pen at one point in time
*  No, but hold on a second so the universe smaller than the head of a pen boom explodes becomes everything well what started that
*  Well, how do we not know that that was somebody somebody press start on a program?
*  That even happened like that the theory is billions of years ago out of nothing everything exploded
*  What do you think you know well you know came up with it you becoming religious on me?
*  You know you know came up with it. Oh, dude if you start talking about Jesus said
*  You can look this up right now the big bang is a priest from the Vatican a priest came up with that
*  There was a theory sign yeah scientist in nope a priest are you sure a million percent?
*  So he was the first one, but you know I have a good idea why?
*  Why that's gonna take like 10 minutes can have
*  I
*  Was icing that thing you know if we're in a simulation until you're talking about you know the homeless guy or the kids
*  Starving in Ethiopia he's like what the fuck dude the guy grinding his way out or the the single mother of five working at McDonald
*  She's like what kind of who the fuck chose this right?
*  What is going on here man?
*  So I feel like only people who are higher up and people that money say we're in a simulation
*  Yes, the gap make that I bet you there's not one dude. We're gonna McDonald's going. I think it's a simulation
*  But that's just because when you're struggling for survival everything is more important
*  Like you're on the edge, but the thing about a guy like Elon Musk
*  Who's one of the proponents of the simulation theory the thing about a guy like him is he's got enough resources
*  To relax a little bit
*  But also he is involved in technology every day and he's probably one of the smartest people on earth
*  And he's financially stable so he can stop and think and think about things in a way where he's not
*  He's not over burdened by
*  Like he has stresses for sure and obligations for sure massive ones three giant companies
*  But what he doesn't have is like survival stress survival stress about be like being poor or being in danger
*  But I'll but also the level that where his IQ is so high right he's on a different frequency
*  He might be too smart. There's a lot of things where when he speaks I go yeah, he's smart as fuck
*  I I don't agree with him. You know I like that's not
*  Once I start seeing like
*  Organic matter like body parts, and they watch it under like some
*  Yeah, and you see some like computer numbers and stuff then I'd be like oh shit
*  What are you talking about for me to believe to take?
*  That we live in a computer simulation seriously. I'd have to see like evidence like that
*  You know if it if it is a computer simulation Eddie that means everything that's physical you're experiencing
*  In a simulated way so it could be everything it could be like if you're if it's just your mind
*  Experiencing things that your mind translate as being physical sensations. Why would it have?
*  Maybe we do live in a simulation. I just I just don't say see any evidence. How about counts at 330 though?
*  Oh, yeah, we knew it. I told you fucking I said we're not waiting for him. It's four o'clock now
*  Yeah, look I'm not saying that we're in a simulation what I'm saying is I think things are a lot weirder than anybody wants to admit
*  Or or just over thinking it or I believe there's so much information the internet and you know there's a smart people
*  We're just overthinking everything there is no simulation. There's that once you live your life. It's over man lights out could be could be
*  We want to think there's something next because we want to hope that our contributions are permanent
*  And then we're gonna we're gonna somehow or another come back and another kids coming to play right your seeds
*  Also the way you treat people and the things that you rub off on other people and they start to carry it on the one thing
*  It's happening right now is
*  we're um
*  We're at a point now where
*  More people don't trust the mainstream information coming in more than ever and it's gotten to the point
*  It's it's snowballing where there's a an army
*  They're called a nonce Q a nonce
*  That they're anonymous, but they're all on the same track looking for the truth digging
*  Digging making YouTube channels boom. There's all these YouTube and they're all popping up
*  They're becoming the new news the real news no
*  commercials no
*  Bullshit motherfuckers that no advertising and stuff. Yeah, no none of those
*  I mean look at the news these look at the news look what they're saying, but who's watching that over nobody
*  No, it's very funny and over what the news over and over they're wrong about everything over and over three years of
*  Trump's a Russian agent they gave Trump the Russian they gave that's the worst thing you could give a politician
*  He's a Russian agent you can get killed for that shit. They gave him the worst shit. They gave him
*  Russia racism rape they gave him all that shit
*  Nothing stuck they can nothing stuck, but if they could do that to the president
*  First time we've ever really seen that being done to a president
*  Yeah, dude if they could do that to him, but they could do that to anybody
*  But it's interesting because he's the first president ever that's made like an assault on the media
*  Yeah, instead of like proving their integrity and being unflappable and sticking to the tightest journalistic standards
*  Yeah, they've they've actually slipped. Yeah, no matter what happened no matter what Trump does they take the
*  No matter what but it's also happening at the same time
*  See Trump got one of the ways that Trump got a lot of attention when he was running for president is being outrageous
*  So they would cover him so all these these news
*  Channels that thought they were gonna expose him for being a jerk or for saying crazy things
*  Cover him they just made him more and more popular you right so their business grew from making
*  Fun of him from talking shit about him from saying he's gonna be impeached from saying he's gonna be in jail
*  That was a part of their business, and then it stayed a part of their business when he started calling them fake news
*  Yep, and so now instead of being like at the tightest of journalistic standards
*  They have actually resorted to a lot of clickbait e shit because now people aren't really reading regular newspapers anymore
*  And they're only watching like short clips online and now people are out in attentions and a lot of people are out there
*  Oh, this is all bullshit. He was right. Yeah, even if you don't like Trump you like how fuck
*  Yeah, but yeah, even if I hate Trump think about this if Trump didn't win
*  the person that would be president right now would have a
*  Body count
*  Think about that shit. You'd rather have a person with a body count than Trump just because he's arrogant and overconfident and all that shit
*  He's a badass businessman the economy is better than ever better than ever unemployment better than ever
*  That's what we have a president here for to make our country better more prosperous. That's what he's doing. Would you wear a maggot hat?
*  I
*  Be like looking over my if you were
*  It says make America to rate again
*  You can get red hat that says USA. They'll punch you. I
*  Used to wear one
*  I
*  Have a thief do people my brother goes don't wear that hat anymore
*  I go why goes because it looks like you're just the biggest Trump's for I go
*  It's a red hat you can't wear a USA. He goes you can't work
*  Look how powerful the media is the power the media is so powerful that anybody wearing a red hat that says make America great again
*  It can get punched super cool. We come at them. Do well
*  I don't know if that media did that of course it was people's reaction to those hats
*  It's anti-trump
*  No, no, whatever all the anti-trump stuff comes from the media. It all comes well
*  It comes to the media because of what we were talking about earlier
*  It became their business to talk shit about Trump and they thought by doing that they were gonna sink him
*  They really did. Yeah, they didn't realize how resilient he is
*  It wasn't just Trump it's Trump was recruited he was there's good people. Okay, we're going to do okay
*  There's a plan how do you know this for sure because I'm into it every day man
*  I just follow Q follow Q Q. How do you know that they're right?
*  Because everything that's happening right now we knew about it all years ago
*  We knew about all this shit the FISA D class all this shit all the people that are going down
*  We knew it's still going on right now Q's dropping right now Q is Trump and the people around him. It's there. It's a an intelligence
*  Dissemination program, you know believes in all that shit
*  It's true. Pat, of course. He's got a thing called a conspiracy farm. He's got a podcast. He was real dude. Q is real
*  It's a hundred percent all it is all Q is is they're dropping info to the people the Patriots the people who really want the
*  Best for the country not the looney left. They don't want the best for the country
*  The left what do you think the looney left wants the looney left right now all the the top
*  The top of the looney left the top of them. They're all gonna go down for some shit
*  It's not just hunter Biden. It's not just hunter Biden. What do you want?
*  They want world wars they want you know what happened remember remember
*  9-eleven the day before 9-eleven Donald Rumsfeld makes an announcement that the Pentagon is missing two point three trillion dollars, right?
*  Guess what? There was gonna be a lot of investigations going on people were gonna go down for that
*  But guess what 9-eleven happens and no one brings it up. So if we have a world war right now
*  Those people won't go to prison. What would you rather go? You rather go prison or war war? This is your theory
*  Well, this is the Q plan, but do you think the world war and something?
*  Hold on a second. You think Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton all these people got together and said hey
*  We're gonna go to jail. Let's we start a world war. So let's clue
*  They're not they didn't say let's not a world war but they want it's a lot more
*  It's a lot more complicated than that. But do they want a world war? Do they want another 9-eleven? Fuck? Yeah, dude
*  You don't think Biden wants a world war three Trump
*  I don't think Trump does
*  Have you seen the video have you seen the video of Biden at the CFR you've seen that video of him bragging doing quid pro quo
*  Yes
*  That's what this is all about
*  This is what they do. This is what they do. This is what politicians do
*  Well, they go to countries they go to countries they go to countries and they say listen
*  We're gonna give you a billion dollars an aid and you're gonna kick back half of it or whatever into our foundations as
*  donations and then we get our money back and then you're gonna hire my son put them on one of your energy boards and have
*  Taxpayers pay him a hundred K a month. They've been doing that of course
*  Trump does that too knows daughter works in his cabinet, right? His son-in-law works for the government
*  No, no, but they're both very legal. Okay, what it's kind of the same thing. It's not the same thing
*  Okay, because it's not illegal because it's not a Biden but by getting your family jobs
*  No, but it's sort of sneaky. That's not bad is what they do. Yeah. Yeah, but
*  The fact that Biden threatened he can't do Biden talk man
*  I can't go in politics because it bores me Biden all of it bores me
*  Three though with I read it scared looks like what I ran did was try to save face and just shoot some missiles in the
*  General direction of the base that play. Yeah. Yeah, and they reported those fucked up may or may not have been an accident
*  They said it was a mistake now that well, they're spec you're speculating
*  You're speculating Ukraine airline and all the well anyways, I don't know about that
*  But they reported Iran reported that they killed 30 Americans. So Iran thinks that we were down
*  No, they're saving face this day. They're saying no no
*  I'm not saying 30 people died. I like what I don't know
*  You're saying Iran said that to their people they were like they both there's a way to they both say face and there's no World War
*  Three. Yeah, that's what's going on. I like what Trump said today
*  When he gave a speech about it that we can all live together in peace and then we can all prosper together
*  Yeah, surprisingly. He doesn't want everyone. He was oh he wants to go to work because the peach man. It's a distraction
*  I can't talk about this. Let's talk about the UFC because yeah, we still we the idea of starting this thing
*  We go deep in these pie and I feel bad. We talked really fun things. I feel good. Yeah like these you like
*  Fine I find what Eddie's info is super super interesting. Thank you. You're fucking with them. No, I'm not I promise sometimes
*  Yes, I'm tired on the side a book. Yeah on the down low. He's slipping into it mean Tripoli go deep into it
*  He's gonna turn everybody. I'm not that deep
*  Married to the ball though, right?
*  Super made of the balls
*  There's only certain ones I can go down. Okay. You said you were married
*  Said you were okay, you changed your mind. No, no, I like balls though. Okay. Well, let's let's start with
*  About doing this a 2019 breakdown but real quick Connor cowboy next weekend fellas next shit. Yeah, we can start with that
*  Yeah, man, I think about that. I was very good in training. Yeah, very lean
*  It looks big and I had Don McCrews on my show the food truck diary yesterday and he saw
*  Connor at the training center in Vegas. It was like dude his footwork the way he moves
*  He's like he has some new shit to him. Really? He's like, I don't want to get into it
*  He's very explosive the thing is if cowboy can survive the initial onslaught it becomes very interesting to see, you know
*  I rewatched Connor and Khabib and you know people always talk about Connor gassing out
*  Well, one of the things that was interesting about Connor Khabib is that the third round he came out guns blazing
*  Yeah, you know Khabib have been mauling him. Have you heard about that camp too?
*  Have you did you hear his Mac life interview? He started doing interviews and he was honest
*  He was man for that Khabib fight. I
*  Didn't train that hard wasn't committed I took the fight, you know, it is what it is
*  He's like that's why I want to rematch. Yeah, and he says he hasn't been committed. Mmm, and I with everything going on the outside kind of
*  Chaos I kind of buy into it man
*  I've been watching some old Connor fights old Connor fights are awesome like from cage warriors
*  But I think you're gonna get a version of that old Connor next Saturday against cowboy. He was throwing a couple where it kicks
*  I don't like that. It's at 170 though
*  I don't like that. Well, it's it's for him, but it's okay because it's basically 155 where they don't cut weight
*  They're both 50 fibers Connor obviously has fought 70 when he fought Nate and you know
*  Connors a small cowboy has fought 70 really successfully against big strong guys dangerous guys like Mike Perry and Alex Pereira
*  Alex Pereira who used to be 55 as well. Yeah, but I think
*  Connor is
*  This is a good fight if he wants to fight 70 because you're not fighting an oosmon like he's talking about fighting oosmon
*  Like that for me. So what do you think? I might just be crazy talk. Well, let me ask so big dude
*  I stood next to him the other day when you know, I go
*  Huge dude. I couldn't believe that just a few hours ago. He had made one set. He's fucking huge
*  He looks like it was 195 with like 3% by it's gonna be hard to beat that motherfucker
*  That's gonna be hard. Oh, do you know he broke his fucking hand training for that fight? I saw it in the fight
*  I called it in the fight Mike. He's not using his left hand. Keep an eye on his left hand
*  He switched southpaw for a little bit was throwing right jabs
*  I was like, I think there's something wrong with his left hand and then somewhere along the line starts throwing it again
*  And he texted me after the fight. He said you called it
*  He was like bro
*  He sent me a video of him breaking his hand in sparring and then he said I just knew I had to just throw it
*  Such a stud threw it anyway, you know that guy's knees were so fucked up that he couldn't walk on concrete
*  He was training for a fight and he had to walk on grass. He would look move over to the concrete
*  He's economy's loser because from fucking is meniscus is torn apart
*  Cartlidge's can't run at all. He can only swim he can only swim
*  He can only swim he does create but he does a lot of cardio and air
*  He's a savage his mind. I think tomorrow's like 32. All right. No, I don't think he's even that old
*  30
*  And the fact that that Colby fight was all stand up all stand up and Colby hit him with hammers
*  They both hit each other but at the end Kamaro took over and he you know that straight right hand that broke his jaw
*  He's one of the best of all time
*  I mean, I was hard to say that when the guys only defended the title once won the title against one of the best in
*  Tyron Woodley and then defend look Colby Covington put away all that trash talk. That guy is a fuck. He's a star animal
*  No, no people want to hate on
*  No, no cheese it's for
*  I came from Culver City and where's your son of a bag of wine with cheese?
*  We have one he was bringing whiskey. We have whiskey. We have why we there's no need to bring
*  We thought you were gonna be like this. I barely got here. I would have you were you missed all the flat earth talk. Ah
*  Sure, you went you meant that miss the Epstein talk, which was really chewing on
*  About the Epstein stuff the crazy stuff you're gonna trip when you hear the ship after the show
*  I want to know what the next door was
*  To me whiskey. Hey, let me see that. How's that one? Where's that Buffalo Trace son?
*  This is my friend Steve vanilla shit. I've had that it's good stuff
*  I like yes his own whiskey. Yes, sir. Yeah, but I need some red wine. You can get some wine too, bitch
*  We're getting crazy. What's up coming off that buddy? Yeah coming off set. Sorry about the makeup
*  Sorry, but my skin being all kinds of smooth. At least your hair. Yeah makeup on now a little bit
*  It's good. I wiped it off with makeup. It's good. Hey B, but do what he did shave your head
*  But do it did shave your head. I love it. I used to have my head so you three dickheads can hang out
*  I know
*  Come to you one day when you're fucking here's my towel
*  He's got great
*  But when you get to be 52 like fuck barbers and they're boring ass conversation
*  Yeah, I don't see you're gonna lose your hair right? Yeah, my dad though. My dad is a
*  Silver you get older
*  You care about
*  Comfortable shoes like you like doesn't more comfortable and who's nice to be around who's nice to be around? Yeah
*  Who's nice fucking right? I enjoy that's that is the number one thing in all of life
*  Who's nice to be around your best times your biggest smiles?
*  The most excitable times are all when we're having fun you and I we think all the fun times
*  We've had our whole lives the most fun times is being around your friends laughing
*  There's some old pictures from the mid 2000s shit

*  Oh
*  Room it's just that you're trying it when you're trying to write stand up you try and do all the things
*  There's a limit to what you can like sometimes those things just just happen
*  Yeah, the main thing is not to worry about not writing. I worry about not writing and it fucks up my other stuff
*  Do you ever do that? Like we're like, I got it right. I just write like I brush my teeth
*  Yeah, right Kate. Yeah, dude. I come on my have a whole thing. I do now
*  I don't even write in my student my office anymore
*  I write all at home and I write at night when I'm high coming home from the store
*  So I come home from the store
*  Everyone's asleep spark up a joint pet my dog
*  Maybe make an espresso and just sit in front of the laptop for an hour and a half
*  Maybe two hours at the most what the morning? Yep. Then what time you get up seven gangster
*  Yeah, but you don't go back to bed
*  No
*  I mean if I go I get up to let my kids out and say goodbye on their on their way to school and then if I'm
*  Feeling good. I'll go work out
*  But if I'm feeling like shit, I'll go back to sleep and I'll sleep for another two hours
*  And then so like those are the days where I'll only lift or I'll do cardio or something like that
*  But in the other days, I'm doing yo, maybe he's running. It's only me right now, you know, I'm on a full
*  Joe likes to be trendy and Joe
*  Joe's an extremist
*  But I did it for an experiment
*  I wanted to hear an Aztec death whistle sure
*  I
*  Think you got a cup it sucked on it. They sucked on it count suck it in they would
*  The Aztecs when they were taunting the enemy they would do that on the hillside
*  Like while they were camped out sleeping they would keep them up all night psychologically fuck with them
*  Jesus Christ time blowing that death whistle. That's no death coming
*  He's already an expert death whistle
*  You think that was some Indians are like dude, maybe that's not a good idea. Let's sneak up on them. No, man
*  They would stay on the outside edges, especially in the old bow and arrow days
*  You could fuck with people because they can only hit you so far away. Is he blowing the Aztec whistle? You're a hundred
*  Sounds like a demon
*  Dude that is me too. That's fuck dude
*  Now imagine a thousand half-naked warriors that are definitely
*  Hopefully love titties like that guy
*  This is bad with the Warriors
*  Okay, you're gonna conjure a demon this is gonna blow out your asshole
*  This is like one of those, you know, it's a bad idea evil. That was scary, man
*  Right. Well, they would do that to scare the fuck out of their enemy Jesus to hard times hard times made hard men
*  No energy coming here and I get here and I have so much I know that's what I'm saying
*  This is called bro energy as we get as we get older we cherish this fun times
*  They're like the best times everything else is nonsense. It's family and fun time. You don't waste time
*  Yeah, but then there's like stuff you have to do that's not fun
*  But ensures that the fun times will continue like discipline exercise work
*  You got it. You got to put in the time. You got a hustle if you don't hustle
*  You're not gonna enjoy the fun time. Yeah, so stay stay its tranquility and excitement
*  Yeah, like how we are right now like having fun
*  You really can only do this correctly if you're not worried about some shit
*  Like if you have some other stuff that you should be handling, but you're not you're blowing some things off
*  Yep, you know your daughter has a recital or some shit, you know, you're supposed to be there
*  You want to hang with your boys that'll fuck with you have you seen the Kevin Hart doc?
*  No, I have not so good. You guys are in it. I love super inspiring man. Fuck
*  He's an inspiring guy. You watch it and you're like, holy fuck. How is Joe?
*  Whatever you think you're doing is the podcast. Oh when he was on here talking school. He's intense
*  I'm right driven. You want to talk about a driven motherfucker. He's also his whole thing is uh, yeah, he wants to be a billionaire
*  Okay, but it's like when it's enough dude, when's enough?
*  He's in this like huge
*  He's like, you know, I just gotta do this and this I'm like I look at my girl
*  You know when is enough? Well, it's never gonna be enough Robert Downey Jr
*  Was here the other day and I'm talking about it. It was saying there's a certain beauty and no one went to hang it
*  He was on your podcast. Yeah, Robert Downey, Jerry yesterday yesterday
*  Use the post next week when his movie comes out next week when how good was that? He was amazing. He's brilliant
*  Really was it really fun? He's a big yeah little short he had to go somewhere about an hour and a half
*  Well, he said what was he saying? You know what? No one was you referring to Iron Man?
*  But yeah about that but also about everything he's talking about you know
*  Great people that have learned you know, like when to step aside when it push we talked about Joe Walsh doing that talked about other
*  like some people just knowing when to just just just relax a little beautiful step back a little and you know, like it's hard to
*  We're talking about good times that those are the most important thing but we're all public right we're four very public people and when you're
*  very public person
*  professionally you
*  Stepping aside almost seems like you're losing something
*  Yeah, you like you just going back to a state of regular existence seems like you're giving up or something, right?
*  Because it's so difficult in the beginning to get good at it and also to get famous and to get
*  Successful that it becomes an obsession and
*  Once you achieve it anything less than that is somehow or other not desirable
*  Even if it would be a happier state for you
*  And so you get caught up in the all the game that you've created in order for you to become successful
*  So even when you're like Kevin Hart who's got massive amounts of riches and massive international fame still isn't satisfied
*  yeah, still has new goals new and maybe that's just how he doesn't he enjoys it or
*  Maybe with someone like me. I will tell you for sure. That's that would not be the case. That would be me being on
*  Yeah an addictive and
*  not being objective or introspective me just going hog walk because I
*  Don't operate like Kevin seems to enjoy it though
*  see with him I wouldn't say it's the same thing because I think he he genuinely gets a real positive
*  Impact out of achieving and then also I think he has a really good sense of how much he inspires people
*  He wants to change he wants to make real changes in
*  Community and all that he's got so many plans my only thing is when I see those schedules
*  And I know you have kids I have a busy schedule compared to a lot of these other guys like God wouldn't
*  You know I'm saying yeah, when you there with the kiddos man, it's tough
*  We're shooting these movies you're doing this Betty brings the kids with them and has tutors
*  That's really I've been on set with him. He brings his kids you can see talks about a documentary
*  Think about tutoring or every being on a set ones. I was I was on two sets with him
*  He had his kids there being on set most the time you're not doing shit. You have a lot of people
*  Yeah, I brought my family when I did here comes the boom we hung around so it's like most of the day
*  You're just hanging around you know what though one of the things I noticed that you have to avoid is as people get older
*  I've been around some pretty
*  pretty successful older people of late one of the things that I notice is that they're generally afraid of losing their relevance and
*  Their usefulness and their impact because if you've been a boomer
*  Don't you think those guys and I don't mention names with those guys that you've been hanging not though not
*  Me neither, but I know who you're talking about but don't you think to get to a certain level of fame and success there has to
*  Be some sort of narcissism so that never really goes away, so that's what they're worried about losing right
*  I don't know for me. I was actually talking not about not about Stallone and
*  I've been around you know just around you get older people who are just told yeah, and I noticed no
*  I never met him
*  But you noticed you just notice that that they're that as you get older you don't get more secure unless you work at it
*  Like anything else if anything you might get more insecure because you're dying and you start to feel like you're losing your relevance your strength
*  Your power all that stuff so a lot of his learning
*  I think what Robert Downey Jr. Was saying that that beauty of kind of learning how to step off and realize
*  Yeah, but then he also just did dr. Doolittle so
*  Just gotta step back meanwhile
*  This Thursday how do you iron man? How dare you bro iron man for just come out? Yeah?
*  He died he dies
*  Was an iron man was it's Avengers. I don't watch him, but I knew that I do think there's narcissism involved in a lot of really successful people
*  Like you mean all of us all of us for sure. There's some of it
*  It's just a matter of you it's a one-man show sometimes
*  It's it's an element that you can put together with a lot of other elements in proper controls
*  And you can make a very useful engine
*  It's whether or not you use that element wisely or whether you not that let that element overwhelm the recipe
*  Where the element is more more potent and has more control than reason and logic and objectivity and
*  Kindness and camaraderie and all the other good elements it consumes
*  I just wanted to be I was a terrified of being a failure you got to like when people admire you
*  You're right when people admire your work and admire what you've done
*  You got to like that and you like that feeling that you get from people and then you work harder
*  wouldn't you say a big part of
*  Males drive to be successful. There's a big part you want like the best-looking girl
*  Yeah, you want to be adored because guys don't ever get that
*  And so when you get that and
*  Then you start getting old and now it's it's it's well your whole life you wanted it
*  Yeah, because now you're falling apart and dwindling away rings over here
*  But you get to a point
*  It's true where but but I think you get to a point where a lot of what you were chasing when you were younger
*  was a sensation a
*  physical sensation of some kind even if it's like the
*  Adoration of crowds and so and then maybe as you get older you go
*  There's got to be that's maybe why people as they get older get a little bit more
*  Quote-unquote spiritual a little bit more scared and tired to
*  Scared and tired together makes it
*  scary
*  But it is man I know this dude when he was younger was never you're trying to hit it that I gotta have I love you
*  Brian a hit of that. I'm a tequila
*  Daddy's got a drive. So do I
*  It's a milder one over it's barely barely psycho
*  You say that I was high for six hours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're gonna work on
*  Get high more often. I think
*  Dude I remember
*  I never get high before I do stamp and I was in the green room with you and I forget who else
*  I was like I'm like these guys. I did once I went well, I'm like, I'm like Joe
*  I can handle this I do a set and I go out there and just eight complete dick
*  I have a method to my madness. The method is when I'm high
*  I will occasionally allow especially when I'm comfortable with the material
*  Allow a complete different breach of thought so like my thought if I'm doing a bit
*  Especially if it's a bit that I've done a bunch of times before and I know how it's structured
*  I'm in the middle of something. I'll allow myself a part where I go
*  Why do we do that?
*  Like who's the first guy who said dude, this is the best way to do it
*  I don't make any sense. We just cut and those things come a lot of times from weed
*  Yeah, but you're a 30 year bet. Yeah. Yeah, if I'm so but I do it on purpose is my point
*  I do it because I'm trying to like allow myself these little weird pathways and every now and then like there's a big part of
*  One of the bits that I have that absolutely came from that and right now
*  It's like one of the best parts of the bits it came from me being baked
*  Joking around about this one particular subject that I already had a bit about on stage and then boom it just comes out
*  I have a different theory about you. I'd love to hear it
*  Well, I think that weed is really good for you because it makes you less defensive because you
*  Naturally have this like what? Oh man, you're always looking for fuck rattlesnake
*  Yeah, you're looking for the predator in the group and you got to be ready
*  I think weed brings that down so it allows you to have a different perspective
*  like a more of a rounded perspective as opposed to a
*  Linear perspective of looking for that motherfucker that might get at you. It might be that just so deep
*  It makes me think that so deep makes me more more vulnerable and more introspective
*  Right and it makes it but it also makes me more curious like weed makes me curious
*  I'm always curious but weed makes me curious in the moment like deeply curious
*  Well allow myself to think about things in a way that I never thought about him before
*  When you're on stage and you're making up bits like, you know, you have a bit and it's kind of on Bambi legs
*  It's real fresh and you're still trying to figure out what the beats are when you're high man
*  It's like though. It's like they come to you sometimes like there's someone that says say applesauce
*  And then boom applesauce comes out I I almost hear the word sometimes
*  You know and it all it only happens if you're comfortable it only happens if you're doing a shitload of sets
*  And only there's a lot of factors
*  I know I'm a little high but I am dying to hear the next door neighbor of m's Epstein
*  I can't stop thinking after the show. All right
*  It's not like a celebrity or anything. Why do you like these? It's just a story theory so much
*  But you don't get into them. Someone asked me why someone asked me why I was a conspiracy theorist
*  It was an interview and they were asked some jujitsu interview. Why are you a conspiracy theorist?
*  And I said, why isn't everybody a goddamn conspiracy theorist?
*  We all know the government lies, but you'll like it and then you believe official stories doesn't make any sense
*  You'll like this so there's this logic this venture capitalist
*  She deals with like the billionaires and she goes um, so what you know, there's these ideas that you know
*  But people all these billionaires get together and then they they they figured out the world
*  This is what we're gonna do this year and they leave, you know, right like the skull
*  Let me tell you why that's complete bullshit like the idea that the powerful get together and it's a
*  So he goes she goes I tried to schedule a dinner with five billionaires five and
*  They the reason they're billionaires is because they're super competitive and they fucking hate their other competitors
*  She goes I couldn't get five of them sit at a table because one dude
*  It fucked the other guys ex-wife the other guy was suing the other guy
*  The other guy was trying to take
*  But the bottom line is she's in the outskirts. She's a kid you actually go
*  No, it's because human beings are competitive and very successful
*  Gentlemen, please stop for a second if there was a fucking lady who wanted to make a lunch with us we wouldn't go
*  No, no, this was for business
*  Oh
*  Who could get she get all
*  She get all she dealt with all them individually. She knew them very well
*  Is it you can't bang billionaires
*  The official story it's adorable
*  You bought the dumbest version of
*  That
*  They wouldn't do it case closed
*  And that was the end of the Illuminati
*  In the Bohemian Grove footage
*  Alex Jones filmed all these elites dressing up like druids and worshipping the owl god mullet. That's real, dude
*  I really do that
*  But what do you what do you I roll?
*  The world because nobody's that organized well, maybe they're not but did you ever see that Bohemian Grove thing that is absolutely 100% real
*  It's not so what Brian it's people dressing up like wizards. Let's say in some
*  Control shit, it's weird burning an effigy in front of an owl
*  Burning man, bro. This is so different than burning man. It's the government. It's people at the highest level of banks
*  It's all these different famous people
*  There's a bunch of crazy really rich influential people that went to that Bohemian Grove and dressed up like druids and they chanted things
*  Have you ever seen it? Yes, you are
*  I did see it cuz you were talking about it and I didn't believe it
*  What do you mean? You didn't believe it? John Ronson was there John Ronson is a hundred percent credible journalist
*  Yeah, whatever you might think about anybody else that was there
*  Although different people that have made YouTube videos on it. John Ronson is legit as they come straight down the middle very intelligent
*  What do you think they're doing there?
*  I think they're doing the same way they do the skull and bones where they get together and they have a group where they all
*  Become a part of this group early on and they feel some kinship just like the free
*  Just like a lot of people but this is very extreme where they're chanting crazy shit
*  They're putting hoods on and they're burning an effigy that's supposed to be a sacrificial person
*  But it's straw in a bundle they do imagine doing that they talk about the owl god mollick. Okay, these are
*  Multi-millionaires, you know, Marina Abramovic is of course he doesn't now you do. Yeah, but Brian you didn't
*  We were text but your initial
*  Objective your initial reactions now you like
*  No, but I just don't believe that that I don't believe
*  Our run the world organized enough, okay to actually get together and create a cabal
*  Let me give you a two-step here
*  Do you believe the footage from behavior and growth there really was these heads of banks and heads of say you believe that right and they're
*  All together, right? Yeah, so wouldn't they talk about business? Yeah. Well, that's probably how they do it
*  This is probably what it's all about. It's probably not as
*  It's like a thing. It's their fight. Do you think they got so rich by being lazy? Of course, they're organized
*  Of course, I'm come up because you become a team with all the other people that are like them
*  They they do things like influence interest groups. That's what they do. Why don't you send a billion dollars of aid over to my
*  Another billion over your
*  Believe like I believe what's going on? That's what we're talking about. Look at this
*  This is the hidden footage that John Ronson and Alex Jones got from Bohemian Grove and like the fucking late 90s
*  I'm gonna say how old is it? I think I like was it early 2000?
*  Shut the fuck up you can hear them they're lighting things on fire. That's the mole at the hour
*  What is the with the volume on so you can hear it put the baby got listen to the volume listen to this shit
*  So they have music in the woods dude, but give me give me the volume
*  Controls okay. It's a dude in other
*  Documented it's like the mop
*  Like that crazy Reagan there like people have been there forever. They've been going there since the beginning of time
*  Yes is one of those things where rich powerful people get together and go hey, we're all in the same team people like to be protected
*  It's what they do it there
*  It's in the middle of California in the middle of the woods
*  You gotta go through a guard checkpoint and I have I have in this area the same area and the same there's this I
*  Have a friend who's a producer who?
*  Got in with one of the biggest producers of all time for a while
*  I don't want to say any names, but he was in that crew there like this
*  There's this producer and he's got this crew of all these different people in his crew to produce shit
*  It's like a it's like a little gang right and it's a top guy everybody knows this sure
*  He was involved in though. It was like a new recruit. Yeah, and they went to a city
*  By bohemian Grove one road nobody no one has access to it unless you're part of this group
*  And it's a big-ass city he goes it's like it's like you're in some Middle East like Abu Dhabi
*  Prince city where everything is paved and just it's insane
*  California it's
*  Reach out to Joe
*  So it's gonna reach out like do you interested in coming our fucking I know they can't control Jonah
*  That's why he's not a big movie star cuz they know they can't control
*  Here's what I think I think that the rich and powerful they gave you a hundred million you do would
*  If someone said I'm gonna give you a hundred million to be in a movie with the writer later later
*  I love the rock I do it just to hug him
*  But but here's what I think I think the rich and powerful get together and have these like they go to they got a big
*  I'm dinner. They're gonna retreat. Yes. You know why I think they do it a couple things you can't really okay
*  They get to fuck do drugs. Nobody's looking. That's where everything
*  Plays correct
*  Where FC came in was they all thought they were protected they all thought that this guy who has these intelligence connections
*  Who's a benefactor of?
*  Science he loves and money on science and he would donate money to their causes
*  They were all together and he was banging these girls and so I'll bang them too sure and then they go to an island
*  So they think they're fine video to be immediate you're being videotaped and you're also being used to influence policy and influence
*  I believe yes
*  He could very well have been an entity of a intelligence agency like I like
*  I have to pee already
*  Drank a lot of water
*  Gallons of water in the stupid diet don't let him get off the rails don't yeah no
*  No, no no no no you've been restrained
*  I thought we're gonna watch classic fights or something yeah, he came too late, dude. I do government shit Brendan
*  Subscribe to the YouTube channel
*  X22 report emirate right now X 20 horrible name, but I'll do it just listen to them that you want to know what's going on
*  That's what's going on and also listen to
*  Subscribe to one at a time X 22 report all right, and then the Dan Bongino show Dan
*  He's fucking awesome. He does jiu-jitsu, too. He's legit Don but damn bond you know training with
*  He reports you want to know what's really going on DC listen to Dan Bongino and x22
*  That's what's really going on all the shit that's going on right now. We knew about this shit two years ago
*  So you know more fam?
*  People were giving up on cue because like when is all this shit gonna come out and then finally it came out all this stuff
*  We know all the players if you pay attention. It's just like Game of Thrones all this shit. It's new to something
*  What about
*  Analytica was that Cambridge and I'm good that
*  Found out that the they were basically like YouTube has an algorithm like if you if you look up conspiracy theories
*  You're gonna start getting they're gonna start curating the algorithm pushes you in that direction
*  That's everything though right even politics if you're a Democrat
*  You're gonna get all the information from that like and what was happening right there is two sides
*  The polar opposite one is right one is wrong
*  So it's really easy to figure out which one's right and wrong you just got to figure out for sure
*  Who's full of shit? Let's see who's first? Where's it coming from Hillary Clinton's full of shit for sure
*  CNN's full of shit for sure so
*  Joe Biden full of shit for sure Adam shift full of shit for sure so you know what out of those four people
*  They're all saying the exact same thing and they're all full of shit and who else is saying the exact same thing CNN MSNBC
*  So we already know okay, so by process of elimination
*  You know that shit can't be
*  Right now what about Tucker Carlson? There's two sides you got to pick one side pick a side one side is it's Tucker Carlson
*  Sides
*  There's three types of people
*  The first one first one people that think Hillary good Trump back right yeah
*  Second people the second type of person is people who think Trump good Hillary bad
*  And then there's the third type that think both of them are bad
*  We gotta stop talking over each other no I'm just this is they can't do this is murder on people's ears
*  You guys done the business too long you should know this you know damn Bon Gino is he does jujitsu
*  Dan Bon Gino he he's a he's got his own podcast. He does YouTube dude. Okay YouTube guy
*  He sometimes does does shit on Fox News, too
*  He's awesome you ever listen to him. No, okay. Well if you're ever interested in
*  a
*  Different side of what's going on. There's only really two sides in DC. There's only two sides in DC
*  There's the side that that believes Adam Schiff, and then there's the other side. Yeah, so for sure
*  I'm shift got in front of Congress and made up that phone call that Trump phone call this whole the
*  Call that this whole
*  Impeachments about he gets up in front of Congress after Trump released the transcript of the Congress Trump said from said hey look into Biden
*  He's fucking on video talking shit about
*  withholding a billion dollars and
*  To Ukraine and aid if they don't fire the prosecutor that's looking out
*  That's going after his son, and he's on video saying this so Trump says look into that shit
*  And so now Trump is getting impeached for
*  Getting the Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden's not the crime. They're not even concerned about the crime
*  That's the body so instead of the actual phone call the Trent the transcripts the trial it takes as usual so you shift goes
*  He pretends he's reading the transcript
*  He says all of this it went something like this and then he starts reading goes listen
*  I want you to I'm only gonna tell you this seven times and said you better listen up good
*  It's exactly like that if you
*  Yes find it
*  Jamie have you ever heard this is like a good impression of shit find it
*  There's a recording of it, but I don't know that I had that
*  The only way you're gonna find it the only way you're gonna find it is that if you go to YouTube they hide everything right?
*  So what you do is the the workaround is you go to duck duck go and in their little spacebar put site
*  SIT too much work to semi-colon
*  YouTube comm and then whatever you want and then it brings up every I started
*  But I started using duck duck go for searches
*  It's the yes saving because if you just go to Google when I would go to Google my Google app
*  I'd start reading news and it would just take me on a fucking rabbit hole and I'd be like a half an hour later
*  Just sitting on the toilet. My legs are numb. I'm like, what am I doing? I live for that man
*  Instead duck duck go I just go right to it and it gives you the opportunity to erase all of your history instantly
*  It's like put it so go to duck duck goes great. I think I heard about it from
*  Some article on the internet that we're talking about how it's like one of the best in terms of like privacy and protecting your privacy
*  Oh interesting one of the best search apps, but what I like about it is it just searches for what I'm looking for exactly
*  It doesn't shadow ban shit. So what you do again?
*  S ite semi-colon YouTube dot com or whatever or ever whatever website you want and then space and then whatever the search
*  Which it's not too much if you're looking for the truth. I never go to Google
*  There's never too much for the truth. He cried. I got duck duck go ready to go anytime
*  I want to search something on YouTube
*  I go to duck duck go because if you go to YouTube and you could
*  Print you could type out the exact title of the video and the author and that shit won't come up
*  They hide that shit. They're hiding everything did
*  Is that I never is only one YouTube in
*  There's Ellen tube what Ellen went oh YouTube just gonna make money off me I'm gonna start my own challenge
*  Hold on you can't make a conspiracy video and put it up on Ellen tube though, can you know?
*  But no what I'm saying is Ellen tube went no no YouTube you're not getting on my content point
*  Point well this red tube no no the ability to just be a regular person and upload something that millions of people are gonna see
*  It's amazing. This is really only one of those
*  The problem is that there's very few people that are controlling all the information
*  Amazon it's very few people and that's a major problem
*  You know what we're seeing is they have the ability to wipe shit out off the internet, too
*  You know the one thing you know
*  Well, and you know what else is problem that is that sometimes you get people that the top the upper echelon
*  You can't even control that you know
*  There was a an article about how CNN the upper management who are older and a little bit more moderate
*  We're looking they had a meeting with their young
*  Journalists and they're like you guys are so hard in the pain against Trump in every way that we're losing viewership because there's zero
*  There's absolutely zero
*  Balance here, yeah
*  It's so unbelievable
*  I know I know exactly what I'm gonna get if I go either the Fox or I go when you turn on your phone your iPhone
*  iPhones connected that every news headline is negative on Trump
*  Opinion it's not it's not opinion. It's like strategic. Let's get this
*  You have a people
*  People are hip to it what people are doing is they're going I know for a fact when I look at Huffington Post
*  Or I look at CNN or Washington Post. Yeah, I'm gonna get a biased. I'm not gonna get objective news
*  What sells now or is man bad, please?
*  What sells now is if you are a pundit if you are a if you're whoever you are you have a show like Don Lemon
*  Or Hannity or what sells you have to you're you're beholden to your ratings
*  It's infotainment. So you have to speak to your base. They their bases don't know be you know, they're looking themselves
*  Yeah, because all they do is talking about is losing all their but there's still a lot. There's still a giant market
*  So everyone says they're losing there's no ratings are down. Yeah, most people ratings are highly inaccurate
*  They don't really understand them. You know how Nielsen's work. They barely know who the fuck. Oh, I agree
*  It's so bad and they can't really a hundred percent like with streaming services
*  What's weird is like Netflix controls all their things when you do a special on Netflix, they don't tell you shit
*  I have no idea. You don't have a problem. That's not weird to you. They give you a lot of money
*  Like I had but if they're giving me here's my thinking but the thing is they give me a lot of money
*  I should begin more right? I don't know. It's a good argument, but they control everything
*  They control the whole network all of it. So ratings are nonsense. They don't give a fuck
*  They know what's popular and what's not so what's popular rise to the top like stranger things and what's not they start canceling
*  It's it's entirely up to them
*  It's weird from a point of an artist or creator because you don't really have any leverage other than the the public
*  Zeitgeist whether or not your things out there it isn't it isn't but the weird thing is like the rating system
*  They have now is it's like either you get no ratings where they have all the information or you get the rating system now
*  It's like what is the Nielsen family? I mean we've done this before they did like a hundred thousand fucking people
*  We still use it for schooled
*  What they find out later is that there are so many other venues that people are watching it on DVRs
*  Yeah, huge all that giant percent
*  Now we had this major jump apparently in the past two weeks and
*  They but by the Nielsen meetings everything stayed the same and then but but the reporters
*  I think was a Hollywood person. He was like no no you guys aren't looking at these other
*  Yeah, but it's the same thing with podcasting too. They've they've redone a way how they judge
*  Determine the downloads for audio podcasts. I'll see video. It is what it is on YouTube
*  That's easy to see but for audio they switched it up. You know I'm talking about Jamie
*  Maybe they switch it completely up. What do you mean?
*  How was it used to it used to be a certain they they would take the two-minute download. It's weird
*  I don't know though the ins and outs of it, but they've completely changed for
*  Advertising what they consider how many downloads you get it's completely different because you have to listen all the way through or whatever
*  It's just that they do a different number now used to be like they used to judge it from minute minute mark two minute mark
*  It's completely I never gave a shit about monetizing my YouTube not even from dad
*  I don't give a shit what that one dude that you worked with he fucked with it
*  I never even paid attention finally look back into we were collecting no money. I don't give a shit
*  So they like demonetize my YouTube channel. I never put any weird shit on there anyways
*  I feel like you would make money if you did. I don't even care. I don't ever want to be like YouTube
*  I don't ever want to be
*  Dependent on them at all. Yeah, but you don't have to be dependent. I don't even care. I don't want to care about
*  Yeah, I don't that money means nothing to me. I'm looking for an alternative
*  Like what is the alternative bit shoot and Alex Jones got completely wiped off?
*  Social media, but he's got his own thing now going back band dot media
*  If you go there that people are just starting their own shit people are going to D live and what else is there?
*  Do you know Jamie? There's gotta be an alternative bigger and bigger echo chambers is what it does. It's good
*  It's good because
*  The thing is it one of the good things about
*  interacting in a YouTube format or social media format like Twitter or Instagram is
*  You know a lot of people
*  A lot, but that's a problem. That's that's that's problem
*  But a lot of people get to see it and there's discussion when you look into the comments people are discussing things
*  They're talking things through but shadow you know you go to once you take it you go to your own personal website growth stops
*  It gets very marginal and then the other thing that happens is it becomes an echo chamber
*  The only people that are tolerated are the people that are the supporters of whatever the person is
*  Yeah, they don't get any criticism and then because mainstream or I shouldn't say mainstream alternative and
*  Competing sites and channels don't want to feature them. They don't get talked about at all
*  You need idea sex you need ideas clashing you have any competition you need you need you need a
*  The free flow of debate and ideas and you have to have discussions and you have to have people that disagree with each other
*  So you can so so that you can see the error of your own ways if you have a if you have an intelligent
*  Debate slash discussion with somebody who knows more than you do or has a different but informed point of view
*  You're gonna come out of that conversation different. Yes, you're gonna you're gonna make some growth
*  You're in the right frame. They're afraid of yes. They don't want that. Well what they want
*  They're not banning the loony left at all
*  But what they will is because that they are the loony left and they think they're doing the right thing
*  But they want what they want is money, you know
*  I was reading the thing about the head of Google and he makes you know something like two million bucks a year
*  But if he hits these performance goals over the next three years, he stands to rake in
*  240 million dollars in stock
*  I was like well, no wonder why they're ruthless
*  No wonder why they make these just no wonder why they take down the slogan. Don't be evil
*  That was their slogan was don't be
*  Don't be evil and then they go like what about 240 million dollars a little evil
*  Yeah, good people will behave crumpling that's what happens in Washington
*  It's just about Lawrence Lessig said Washington has become a special interest cesspool where good people if you want to get ahead
*  You got to figure out a way to be good people must behave
*  Crumpling because it's an economy but not all of them not all of them because if they were all corrupt
*  There would be no reason to suicide anybody. There would be no reason to bribe anybody. There's good people in there
*  Yeah, you fuck up someone's willing to kill a motherfucker just to avoid you don't have to kill
*  There's always good people. You just have to figure out which who are the good people?
*  You don't have to kill people anymore. You think you're on people what didn't have seen just that commit suicide
*  Do you think Kevin spacey's killing people?
*  No, you see that new video that came out right before the dude suicide of himself that accused him of grabbing his dick
*  Oh, yeah, isn't it for people?
*  Kill him with kind come on man. Oh really doing this Frank Underwood. You haven't seen it. No
*  Like a week later, yeah, that's what I'm talking about the shits going on and no one gives a fuck
*  We know you know I'm Simon
*  What's I'm sure you do no, no you just you just destroy the reputation
*  I'm
*  Brian slow down if your reputation is already destroyed though like Kevin spacey
*  And there's a guy claiming that you grabbed his dick might be a good idea to kill him watch this a little bit
*  Give me some vibe. He doesn't want to go to prison. That's all but you got to avoid this
*  And I'm grateful to have my health and in light of that I've made some changes in my life
*  Dude, he's MK ultra you think so
*  Into
*  More good in this world. Ah, yes. I know what you're thinking. He's serious
*  I'm dead serious and it's not that hard. Trust me the next time someone does something you don't like
*  You can go on the attack, but you can also hold your fire and do the unexpected
*  you can
*  Kill them with kindness. Whoa, dude. He put that out and everyone is cool. Everyone's cool
*  He's such a good actor
*  He died a few days later here what he just said and do you know what he's in the middle of that's that
*  It's not like hold on Eddie. Let me
*  Before we hey be
*  Kill himself do you watch that video? Hey B, do you think that's a turn?
*  Do you think that sign was commit suicide or was murdered? I don't know what
*  I totally believe he would kill himself. Why would he want to be alive? Where is he gonna go?
*  I mean his life you think he committed suicide. It's very possible. Yeah, how many guys from Kevin space?
*  What are you showing me? Jamie? What's going on December 26th? Yeah, that video is posted on the 24th, dude
*  But here's the thing though, that means the guy saw it for two days
*  So for two days, he probably on a loop watch this video this guy who grabbed his dick. He's like, why didn't I just punch him?
*  Uh bang. Yeah, but he commit suicide cuz he grabbed his dick
*  He said a lot more issues and grabbed his dick and said let's go outside and get some air. That's it. Yes
*  But I'm just saying the whole other life
*  I'm sorry to get a big grab by Kevin space on a lot of people kill themselves that never got their dick grabbed by Kevin space
*  But some thing is the thing is this guy killed himself two days after Kevin space he released that video
*  It could easily just be a coincidence
*  It could easily be that the type of guy that Kevin space he grabs their dick
*  They're probably not doing so good in the first place
*  Well, wasn't he super young when he grabbed that dick? Well, that's uh, I don't know. This is a different one
*  There's many so few this. Yeah, he was aggressive with the dick grab. I didn't know he's gay. Here's the thing about it, man
*  Here's the thing about it. It had to have worked if he grabbed that many dead. Oh, how many?
*  Yeah, it's cuz they don't know knows everybody's so homophobic I blame homophobic people on Kevin spacey out there grabbing
*  I got as much of a monster rapist as Harvey Weinstein is as much of a fucking piece
*  You made some good he fucked he fucked a whole lot that all that
*  Yeah, yeah that were that allowed it where his consensual oh these boys took a lot of swings had a lot of home runs
*  Yes, hit a lot of home. Yeah, they had their bag of tricks
*  That's why Kevin spacey felt like he could grab dicks cuz it worked before correct because there's probably some thrilled
*  heterosexual guy who can't believe he's got Kevin spacey's cock in his mouth like
*  Celebrity doesn't cut through your heterosexuality. You understand it does for a really
*  person would have kissed I might have kissed Tom Cruise on the mouth just because I was talking for an hour and a half and
*  I wanted to be his friend so badly dude that was it it makes if you're really really dumb a super smart
*  Gay guy could talk you into blowing them
*  Bit where I was always I said I'm always suspicious of
*  Bisexuals because every single one of them I've ever met was a moron and I have a theory
*  I don't believe is really bisexual
*  I think there's gay dudes and then there's really gullible straight dudes who get talked into blowing craft
*  Some dudes you can fucking talking to anything and then all of a sudden like I'm by
*  I
*  Definitely by
*  Spectrum of these people that don't there's people that are asexual they don't give a fuck about their guys
*  Yeah, this is my friend of mine knew a guy who would be like I'll fuck it. I'll fuck anybody
*  Yeah, what are you talking? He goes show me the money you put money on the table
*  There's not there's not a man or a woman. I wouldn't fuck yeah, but that's money
*  Yeah
*  And I'll let anybody fuck me, okay
*  What cost more I needed the money what cost more getting fucked or fucking someone cuz if you fuck someone you gotta get it up
*  Can you touch them and ask hard?
*  Fuck me
*  No, you want to you want to fuck me that's another 200 not practically Brian
*  Practically harder to fucking guy you're going no condom another I love that so it's to the lesson of fights listen listen listen
*  What would be?
*  What would be harder to do would it be harder to fuck a guy or get fucked by a guy? Oh?
*  Question I don't it's a terrible question
*  I don't think you should get fucked by a guy unless you're gay
*  But if you weren't gay getting fucked you already get out might be easy. Yeah, I agree
*  Yeah, because I'm gonna get it up right yeah, I get it open that up
*  You got a thing and then people say you had a hard day you had a hard day you could say
*  My dad saw if he fucked me in the ass. I had to do it. I know I know give a fuck
*  I had fuck you want to fuck my shit shoot. I know I know a fighter who will remain nameless who said
*  He said we were talking about his he was with his wife
*  And they were talking about cheating and stuff and he said tell him tell him what I do tell him what I do
*  No his wife goes hey tell him what you do if you caught me cheating and he goes
*  I she goes now tell him he goes
*  Yeah, I would there's a reason I have Viagra around and it's not cuz I need it for her and I go
*  Well do tell now I'm all ears
*  He goes well
*  I would take Viagra and I would get my dick hard and I would fuck him in the ass and that takes 45 minutes
*  Whatever this guy's a big dude, too
*  So heavy knows who it is and I was just like you are amazing and he was dead serious
*  I'll tell you who it is next. That's an interesting way to approach a project you could guess yeah, okay, we'll talk later
*  So 2019 what do we do to Ben Askren?
*  That was you and me bro. We had a big part of that. I'm still a fan. I'm a huge fan
*  That's my quarterback. I'm a huge fan, but three fights in the UFC
*  Two things happen one big time off of
*  Competing to you know competing in one FC against is not the same level of competition
*  I don't believe as even he fought in Bellator. I'm close and then three you know the guys got a fucked up here
*  He's also older though people people forget like you know when Ben got to the the UFC. He was a older dude
*  He had a lot of fights. He was older
*  They didn't get him when he's a young this hip thing spring chicken this hip things not a new thing
*  Do respect please with all please don't disrespect with all due respect do respect as great a grappler as he is he's
*  simply not
*  He's not a good striker, and he's not close to a striker that you need to be in the UFC
*  He just isn't if maybe I'm blind, but if you're gonna tell me that Ben Askren is a no one's gonna argue this right?
*  See without being that no
*  Grappler that doesn't matter doesn't matter it doesn't matter. Yeah, he didn't lose the damian mind because of his striking true
*  He didn't lose he was losing mass of a doll that was that was some crazy shit
*  I saw that coming whatever happened with the Robbie Lawler fight. I believe and and and
*  Whatever was whether he tapped or he didn't tap
*  I
*  Believe there are guys in the UFC like that a lot of guys like that that would have done the same thing to him and would
*  Not have gotten caught in that thing. I mean I don't know but I mean I
*  I
*  Such a high level that's why we want to see right you're right is striking was subpar for sure
*  Grappling is so good that it doesn't matter. That's why he was there
*  He was there because he's a specialist. I mean his grapplings off the charts and Robbie Lawler
*  There's no argument whether or not Robbie Lawler tapped. He definitely didn't tap
*  They just thought he might have been out there the wolves do think about the guys they
*  Know
*  About Khabib though Khabib's so formidable because of his grappling and what he's a big Khabib didn't take any time off like that
*  Like the taking the two years off that Asghar took off and being 36
*  Yeah, he's on people forget he was older
*  But also when you say thrown to the wolves, it's also like you were a champion from one champions
*  Like you were a former world champion. So when he come over the UFC ain't playing games. Look at Eddie Alvarez
*  He had a tough go look at Justin Gaethje
*  Like there you want to come over your world champion you getting some dogs man
*  If you're not fighting the UFC and I know you know Scott Coogs I love Scott Coogs nothing you see it ain't shit
*  Here's where I disagree Douglas Lima. I think Douglas Lima might be he might be right up there with everybody else at 170
*  He might be one of the best in the world. He might be able to knock out all of them. Oh, yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, he might lose but he might knock them out. No, you're out of your mind man. Listen
*  Is world class he's he's right up when I watch him fight when I watch him fight Michael Venn and Paige when I'm when I watch
*  Him fight Donald. Yeah Semtex when he fought Paul Daly, dude
*  He is about the guys just list on as legit as it comes now go through tomorrow
*  Go through Colby's or go through Woodley's or Darren Till's path five opponent. That's true
*  You're not fighting the best day in day out
*  That's just you you fight one one guy who's really good and then you got to off
*  In front of him lost to Rory in a very close fight and then beat him in the rematch
*  But what what I'm seeing from him is world-class skills
*  He and ridiculous knockout power
*  He may or may not be able to beat those guys the three things you never know
*  But he's definitely in the conversation
*  Yes for me when I look at ability when I look at what he can accomplish even though he's you know
*  He's a huge seven year. He's a big motherfucker man
*  He's got some serious power when he KO'd Korshkov when he KO'd Michael Venn and Paige
*  He's a monster. I could he could KO anyone. He's a monster
*  Yeah, and I love at Lima does I have so much respect for him
*  But to me and until you're in the UFC and you're in that grind
*  You know, I can't it's true that you can't say he's the best that's true, but you can't say he's not world-class
*  I think that guy's not world-class, but in but I can't say oh he would be the UFC's champion
*  I would never say he would be a top five. You can't say it in that division. That division is too crazy
*  You can't say it in any division Maslado could be any 170 pounder alive on any given night
*  He can light up any 170 pounder. How do you think?
*  So could use mine it's it's you know, these guys you got to realize humans in fighting are never a flat board
*  It's always just like a little wibbly a wobbly ankles fucked up. I got a headache
*  I'm having a hard time wake up my girlfriend's fucking with me. I'm getting over the flu. They're never
*  Exactly at the same level in every fight
*  So there are guys that are at a level where you catch them when you're up and they're down you win or they're up
*  And you're down and they win that's real man. That's your name in that
*  John Jones is his wave so much higher
*  The thing is when his wave goes down he just hits their best and then he pops right back up to untouchable levels
*  It's just about the size of the waves, but he still waves
*  He's got the OSP waves versus the chao son in waves
*  We comes in like a fucking murderer just smashes
*  Beats showgun he came and just smashed him he shows that his wave is way higher
*  They don't get someone say the you saw the wave made to be shitty. I don't think that's true
*  I don't need I don't think I think he's good. No matter what I think
*  No time I'm just saying a lot of naysayers say well, there's the you saw the wave and there's that okay
*  But those people are not following science because if you look at what you saw it is shown in the test that he's failed
*  They're not listening they're took they're talking about entirely
*  not
*  physically active
*  Versions of this drug like not it's not it's not having an efficient having yeah, what's the word to look for physiological doses?
*  Yeah, it's not strong enough. Yes
*  Performing performance enhancing and it mimics what would happen if you have a tainted supplement so most likely he's taking dick pills
*  Yeah, I agree. What do you think I could take in?
*  Coke but but all they're doing job that has creatine all they're doing is going okay when you saw those here
*  These were the performances and saw this once you saw the I'm sorry when you saw it wasn't there these were the performance
*  I saw it's your account personal life turmoil. You have to take into account arrests
*  You have to take into account the crash into the woman the broken arm. You got to take into account
*  Possible over partying and all the crazy shit that was going on and then suspension
*  I also think a lot of people take this into account and you know, I talked to Dom McRae's about this
*  I
*  Also, the government is no Dom McRae is good. I'm fighting him. I'm sorry you fucking
*  Please stop
*  Someone using sleep as an excuse why they lost bro. I don't sleep that good that week
*  People don't take this consideration
*  I also think it's tough for him to get up for the Anthony Smith and I know you've been the dominant gray is like
*  I think it's tough for him to be like, all right, I thought Shogun
*  I thought fucking all these superstars Rashad rampage chaile
*  Leota machida Vitor Belfort you go through the whole list. You're like, let me ask you this
*  John Jones versus Francis in Ghana
*  Why'd you have to go there dude what
*  That's gonna happen for sure. The only thing the only thing that I would hope if that ever happens is that we
*  Allow in Ghana to get the press that he deserves like it did like to pump him up in a way that he deserves to me
*  People are terrified of that man. They are hardcore fans and hardcore fighters like everybody who's in the know and everybody in the heavyweight division
*  It's not like a superstar. He's not a world. It's too tough to get superstars status
*  You gotta do some well, the thing is if he had be a dark blue fight, but I think yes
*  Yeah
*  That was a hard one the steep a fight fucked him up to if he had beaten steep a he would help
*  He would be a national hero
*  He'd be a huge he would be an American story. Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm gonna for sure
*  Well, he's still a hero there. Well for sure he is but I mean in this country
*  He would be a hero of like the scariest guy in the world was an immigrant that barely spoke English a little while ago
*  No, he's mercant people and he's only been fighting for six years and he developed his strength by the way in a sand mind
*  When he was a child doing child labor, it's insane
*  What the fuck any of us to be a really nice guy is a great guy great guys from camera and he's funny
*  He's like smiley happy guy. He hits people and they go into orbit. They go into orbit. It's their soul leaves their body
*  You know, it's crazy. You know, it's crazy. I think John beats still beats him, dude
*  What a fight that would be he does right? What a fight that would be fuck John would be the John beats steep a
*  If you had gotten your head, I think John's everybody there's not a man on this planet who beats John Joe Wow
*  We've never seen John where he doesn't have to lose weight
*  We never seen John where you know, he's not cutting
*  25 pounds and just fucking out goody watching his diet
*  What if he's eating healthy like good large portions and just hydrating as much as he wants all day long
*  Maybe he's 10% better, you know, we don't know. Maybe John Jones is really the best 240 pound heavyweight in the world
*  He's just been fighting walk it to 25 but nobody could get there easily
*  30 of these right and if he decided that look his he comes from one of the best camps in the world, right?
*  if Javier Vasquez and crazy Bob Cook get together and they they come together with like a
*  Physical plan, you know for like a Kane Velasquez, right?
*  If they're gonna if they're gonna look at like what's the best weight for a guy like Kane Velasquez?
*  They're probably gonna say, you know, you don't lose any weight like 240 to force the first heavy. Yeah
*  Yeah, Jackson Winklejohn, they're gonna do the same thing hundred percent
*  One of the best camps in the world John Jones was raised in one of you look at the success
*  Just go down the line from Carlos condit like even yo El Romero went down to Jackson Winklejohn
*  He was training with their job. It's gonna be like aka or like Rufus or like any of the top camp
*  They're gonna go. Where do you think he's going?
*  Yeah, you're he said he's going I know but they're gonna figure out a weight for the point
*  I'm aware is even 235 you said is realized it's not he's way bigger than you thought way bigger
*  And he's definitely a better striker I would imagine I don't know about MMA but he's that would be an interesting fight
*  He's just too small. I think he isn't he isn't he too thin. Well, he's a solid 30 pounds lighter
*  I think walking around the John is that's it very so that's that's why he's not he doesn't want to fight him now
*  He wants to get older Israel can gain weight
*  It's real can you know if he decides like Canelo Alvarez when he went off to fight Kovalov, right again?
*  Same kind of thing Canelo Alvarez is a world-class camp. They figure out how to do this. They might use a little
*  Might be there I'm just this might be
*  It's not that outlandish
*  It's not that outlandish when you see him you're like
*  But if he can put on the weight and physically get up to a certain weight because his skill set his his
*  Pure his striking is better. Yeah. Well, he's legit world class legit world class
*  He lost in the title fight to James Willis and I thought he won
*  It was is a very close fight the way did Robert Whitaker. Yeah, and he looks like he's six five
*  He's a beast man six four, but but the thing about him and that whole gym they won
*  Jimmy yeah, Volkanov ski. He just became a world champion
*  Dan Hooker who bounced back from the Barbosa fight looking like an animal looking better than ever your boy Felder
*  That's crazy fight and they're in I think they're in New Zealand, right? Yep. Oh
*  Yeah, dude, there's a bunch of killers in that camp, but they would have to have it
*  They would have to formulate a game plan. They would have to say okay
*  What what weight is the right way? Is it you too big at 230?
*  Could you be 220 is 220 are you faster like when you have the most cardio when what's the fucking point of diminishing returns?
*  Just hate I think with like my example with came is probably not the best example
*  But I still to this day think of him as like probably one of the greatest talents a heavyweight division
*  That's a great example
*  It's an example in his weight, but I don't think he ever concentrated on it
*  I think he was just like that just went at it just just trained real hard and was 240 but like this steep a
*  Steve-bass example 238 but like okay
*  Like here's one like Marlon arise like Marlon rise when he went to when he fought at 135 against a hood on faded
*  The next fight he came in lighter like they're you know American top teams like listen listen listen
*  Let's bring your body weight down a little bit. Let's figure out
*  What's the right formula here?
*  And that's why a big camp that has a lot of experience in world title fights and knows like seeing so much
*  You might get so important because they can look at you to go Brian. I don't see you as a 70
*  I see you as a 55
*  I think we got a nutrition order like what they've done like think about what what's what's happened with Aldo just with the introduction of
*  a nutritionist
*  35
*  You have trouble with 45 legitimately made 35 and look like a beast and took big shots
*  Take some people thought he won the fight. I thought he won the fight. Yeah, that's fair. I thought he won the fight
*  It was close
*  Yeah, yeah
*  But dude, that's that's all about
*  Optimizing all your possibilities, you know, and then there's guys like John Jones who don't have to do that
*  That's so good. Yeah, I just want to get a heavyweight. I just want to get a heavyweight
*  Because he'll get up for it. Can you imagine that the fucking trailer for him for steep a then him versus Francis in Ghana?
*  Oh, I'll think they announced a fight. Thank you
*  Just wonder though about his brothers being all-stars in the NFL. Hold on when you say his brother
*  Yeah, I think was second the league in sats. I don't think about that now and his brother
*  And would you say his brothers are better athletes than John in one way or another or is it?
*  When it comes to what the NFL requires
*  Chandler and this Arthur now if the one on the rights of the pro baller, yeah
*  That guy's training
*  See my guy who could be John John 6 5 2 60. He ain't making 205 son. Oh, no, he's not that dude's huge
*  Jesus but that's phenomenal
*  That's the big things that they grew up beating each other's asses
*  That's what John's used to yeah, and then that the one on the left who's a D tackle then I feel I think he's still
*  In it, but he would come in for John's camps and hold John down. He would yeah, he would train with John
*  Oh, yeah, great guy. He's enormous. Yeah, there's video and pictures of Arthur Arthur training with John
*  He's so big. Look how big oh my god. He's 300 plus. Yeah anyway
*  So it's a great gene pool. He's coming from and you know, I have this theory about
*  Guys who grow up with brothers that beat their asses like Matt Hughes one of the greatest welterweights of all time
*  One of the things about him is he had a twin brother. It was exactly him doesn't ask when I have a twin brother
*  I don't know but I think so Matt Mark Hughes used to beat the shit out of each other
*  He don't check out I think I've been asking as a twin brother
*  you ever see Joe Lowe's on and his brother beating the fuck out of each other at a
*  There's like a family picnic the deals brothers do they have an MMA fight in the grass at a family picket
*  Yeah family picnic they're they're all hanging out in the backyard of a house the whole families around with fucking red cups their hand drinking beer and
*  These guys are beatin the fuck out of each other. Yeah, my brother had to go see a therapist. He'd beat me up
*  I'm sorry Bennett and Max Asperin and not twins definitely not twins
*  Yeah, it's like that thing about brothers. It's it's that's one of the ways you make tougher people
*  Because you don't get an escape every day that big motherfucker is right next to you and you're like shit
*  You have to learn like
*  Chris Weidman same thing is well they did him when he was younger
*  They did a really interesting study about the fastest people in the world all were like either the youngest or second
*  Yes, they're black large fan. Yeah, and they had to keep up with their older brothers and sisters
*  There's there's some that's a little bit of bro science, but that is written up in the book
*  I think it's outliers sports gene or outliers. I think it's in outliers. Yeah, it's in one of those
*  It would examine why people are hyper successful. That'd be a good name for a podcast bro science
*  Where a down there car to launch carte blanche to talk about bullshit? Yeah, you don't have to be an expert on it
*  And that's what we all do anyway
*  Joe all of us. Yeah, that's what we call it bro science. Then you have a free pass. Yeah, dude. I do it, too
*  I don't know half what I'm talking about
*  Have you like looked at a chart how much of what I'm saying do I actually know what I'm talking about?
*  That's like different to your last question
*  Yeah, but that's them questions we just yeah, but would like it like a guy Lane Norton
*  I'll I said to him one time I go let me can I give you my theory on nutrition
*  No, let me just give you my whole philosophy and I and I went off on insulin
*  Hey, and Lane is so great cuz Lane just went I mean, you know
*  You're in the general area
*  I guess it's kind of like describing basketball as five dudes that run down the court and try to take a leather ball
*  Put it in a hoop. He did we should talk more you're talking about him. He did a very
*  In-depth breakdown of all the things that were incorrect about the game changers and incorrect about the documentary
*  Debate about the game changes between Chris Kresser and James Wilkes
*  James Wilkes did a good job because Kresser was wrong about a few things that he called them out on and Kresser didn't really
*  Didn't he's not a computational what? Yeah, and he was ready to go wasn't as good
*  Well, James is really smart guy very really smart that I'd said about him before
*  Before the podcast when they were talking about other vegan people that are you know proponents of the diet
*  I'm like you gotta understand this guy's way smarter than most of these muckle knuckleheads
*  There's a lot of people that do using it for self aggrandized reasons. Yes
*  That's a word aggrandizement grandiose. Oh, no a self aggrandizing like would you say self aggrandized reasons?
*  Anyway, they're just trying to pump themselves up. What what he's doing is he has whether he's right or wrong
*  He has a very firm belief in what he's saying. He's also he's very intellectually capable in terms of like he's also done the research
*  And he's not scared. He's ready to go
*  James willick has done Wilkes. You know his name Wilkes Josh Josh
*  He's done his pie. He's done his fucking work. Do you is rated guy?
*  Very impressed but the end of the day
*  Lane Norton goes over not just the debate where there you know
*  There's they got stuck in the weeds on a couple different issues in terms of like quality of protein
*  They were passion calories and passion. It's just it's a long
*  Conversation it's a long conversation
*  But really it's better had with someone like Wilkes and someone like Lane Norton because Lane Norton has got a legitimate PhD
*  Really understands nutrition really understands the science of it and is a full-on
*  100% science guy now there's a thing that vegans do where they say oh that guy's
*  Funded by you know the meat industry the dairy industry know most
*  Studies are funded by some kind of an industry that does not automatically mean that the person who?
*  Put those studies out is a corrupt person. It's bullshit. It's a bullshit
*  Argument strong argument. It's a straw man. They use to diffuse legitimate argument
*  Yeah
*  Should have stuck to his one point which is you can eat some meat and dairy without dying
*  Not just some man not just some you could you probably quite a bit Joe only eats meat listen, but that's just now
*  Okay, this is I'm not a good example. I've been doing it for like I said 11 days or something like that in the neighborhood
*  How do you feel? Yeah, you said you feel great. I feel great. I lost seven pounds
*  I lost seven pounds out of full six pack now like all my gut went away
*  I still have a little bit of love handles. I got a little bit of this right here
*  11 days and 11 days at the end of the month that'll be gone all that love handle shit will be gone
*  I'm my goal. I'm like 197 my goals like 190. I lose seven more pounds
*  Turns out talk to my doctor when I pissed I broke my leg fuck
*  Yeah, I have a fracture because I told you I was like something's wrong there
*  There's a fracture where my knee and my cartilage connect you have to have surgery. No
*  No from falling skiing some lady wiped out in front of me
*  I tried to get away from killing her and I she just like she just was on like a hill trying to put her
*  Skis on and she just slid right into the fucking trail last minute and I was like yikes and there's kids here
*  It's like fuck there's too many people and I just went out if I yourself I went down but my knee went
*  And I my head went but back I banged my head hard
*  Head crack and I was like, oh, I don't need that brain damage. Did you have a helmet on?
*  of course, but I was like but but it was like
*  When I landed I was like fuck I did not need that and then for the rest of the day
*  I was a little half dizzy and
*  But anyway, I was like man, there's something wrong with my knee
*  I did a yoga class and the next day was kind of like a little sore and the next day after that was sore
*  Er, and I was like god damn it. I got to get an MRI
*  So I got an MRI today and there's some sort of a fracture where the the cartilage meets the bone
*  So what are you gonna do? I got a chill. They just said do nothing to heal on small fracture
*  It's interesting because I'm not walking with a limp. I really own it's very small
*  But I only feel it when I go all the way down like if I was doing a squat ass to ground squat
*  I would feel it at the bottom. Yes
*  But I'm not it's like I just was trying like what is this legit or am I being a pussy?
*  You know the the thing you have when you get injured
*  So, you know you said this about I went and got those insoles after you got them for your plantar fracture eyes
*  Check this out. So remember when I was always talking about I would wake up and I couldn't walk
*  My feet I couldn't move my feet and I have to warm my feet up and I was walking
*  I was 70 I couldn't walk downstairs TRT is your friend, right? No, I did those insoles
*  I don't have any problem either to bounce out of bed shit's going to on me when you said it on the podcast
*  When you said your plan of pressure, I was like wait
*  I've had no fucking problems getting out of bed. My feet are a hundred percent ever since I had these insoles
*  You're welcome you're welcome change my life. What are the insoles you go to a running store was it called runners roost?
*  Yeah, it's in Santa Monica. I step into a mold and then you have it takes five minutes
*  Yeah, and then they print them out right there. I have my own right now. So put them in all my shoes
*  Really his plantar fasciitis went away went away
*  Completely got that plantar fasciitis. What's that? You can also get that to go away by strengthening your feet
*  I think doing barefoot exercise I had it when I was fighting I'd be barefoot all the time
*  I used to wear those naked shoes. I said do Jitsu run on the mat to do my condition barefoot
*  My feet were strong, but forgive me if I'm wrong, but I think that that is overused
*  I think that's the thing that it comes from I think plantar fasciitis is like a tendonitis of the foot
*  I think it comes from overuse. So where the
*  Right now we're heels at all the all the ligaments meet like
*  Kind of underneath there and right where it meets it flares the fuck up when you have it bad
*  You can't walk. Oh dude, I feel like a hot poker stick
*  I think it's real similar to like tendonitis and I've had tendonitis on my elbow and I've had it on my shoulder
*  I'm talking on bearable. Like I could I couldn't run I couldn't do anything. I think it's real similar
*  It's gone. It's gone. Think about all the shit you're doing running around when you're training all that barefoot
*  It's probably puts a heavy load on your feet
*  Probably have to build up to it like like a guy
*  Okay, but I did for years like it I didn't I you know, I was doing that for seven years then like on year seven
*  I got it. Well, it's probably overused. Yeah, maybe seriously and then all those years of training
*  No, you used to run a lot too and you're huge man
*  I still do that's I think that's the thing too when you're 260 and you just run or just 70
*  What are you saying on the beach? What do you say though?
*  What do you want to be what it's like goal 235
*  Oh, yeah, how about you do this carnivore diet? That's what I want to do. That's what I'm gonna do
*  I'm gonna do it with you. I'm telling you me. Hey Brian is worried about the farts meat only bro
*  Red meat for me and Joe D. What scared why you scared about you get farts? No, that's the thing
*  Not only do I not get first of all my
*  Diarrhea is legendary like they would talk about it in books. No, I do it's at it right now
*  That's the carnivore's diarrhea scholars scholars in the past. They encountered this kind of diarrhea
*  They would soon was haunted by demons
*  Photo of your shit right now, but that can't be very healthy. Oh, it's the most healthy
*  Why it doesn't get any system science? So you're getting diarrhea and you're eating
*  No, the most of the diarrhea has gone away, but the ferocity that the explosiveness we had it
*  It was sometimes I enjoy it man
*  The way that I described it was like I do not trust my asshole and it was coming out black. Take a look at that
*  Oh, no. Yeah, that's my toilet say me. What was that peak of hell last week? Not even not even last week
*  What's today just show me from there?
*  side-effect of a carnivore diet apparently
*  Are it's just black liquid like it's not like I'm gonna write a letter to the president like you're a squid like you're a fucking ocean
*  squid
*  You can swim if a shark comes at you just shit
*  There's something about having no carbs. I haven't had zero. I've had no bread. No, not you get lightheaded though
*  No, I've been a problem. Wow, but the other than the diarrhea which is
*  But the the thing about
*  Black tar heroin apparently carbs absorb water. They'll help absorb water and then they pump up
*  So your body is used to this sort of a balance and according to dr. Sean Baker
*  I don't know if he's correct, but he's a carnivore proponent
*  He says that what's got to happen is your colon has to adjust the factor
*  You're no longer consuming carbs and your body has to figure out what to deal with all how to deal with all the liquid
*  You lose weight when you're shooting fucking diarrhea. That's true
*  But I've also been eating a probably a diminished amount of calories and by only having one thing
*  It's not really one thing because I'm eating
*  balance between steak and like beef steak and elk and bacon and occasionally I have eggs you can have eggs has your
*  Classroom salmon. That's what I asked me fuck you're going so
*  I asked you that
*  I'm getting I got my blood work done on Monday and I'm gonna get it done at the end of the month to you
*  You should do carnivore. Here's the thing is that dietary cholesterol has very little effect on blood cholesterol and body cholesterol
*  Most of what people have with high cholesterol a lot of is genetic a lot of it is sedentary life
*  There's a lot of factors diet is one of those factors and there's also some people they just
*  genetically should never have a high
*  High cholesterol diet or a high saturated fat diet just genetic genetically. It's terrible for them
*  How do you like some people shouldn't eat peanuts or your mom Brazil nuts?
*  Have you heard of that?
*  You can do the you can do the bunch of tests my boy Todd Feldman did this and he found out if you should be
*  Fasting if she'd be having carbs or kind of carbs kind of proteins. It's crazy man. Yeah, I mean there's a it's a it's a
*  Super-intense testing we find out health nucleus down and that's Craig ventures company
*  I'm not going
*  We can go and do a show it's a five five hour physical
*  What do you do
*  There's something they can do in La Jolla they can't do in Los Angeles
*  You just know this guy longevity special
*  He wants you to use he wants to use you for your Instagram likes
*  Yeah
*  Hey
*  And there's no longevity specialist in Beverly Hills Brian any Bravo hasn't talked for 15 minutes just brewing with conspiracy theories
*  It's just popping this pop
*  Well, they do get all your they do get a lot of information on you
*  They do sell your data your dad is being sold left and right all the time fact fact
*  That's a fact your dad is always being sold. We don't know. Yeah. Yeah, that is a fact
*  So maybe Eddie's right the end of the day. Maybe Eddie's better be more like Eddie than me
*  He's definitely right about something. Oh, yeah, that's the nicest thing you've ever said about me. It's true
*  I appreciate it
*  I get super quiet as I get older like when I find out we're alive to for 18 years
*  By by essentially all the top policy makers about Afghanistan. I think that's I think that's like the way you say Afghanistan Afghanistan
*  Afghanistan I love that was never a winnable war
*  Are you surprised no, I'm not but I'm naive
*  You know what it is
*  I'll say this whenever I hear that people at the top are doing things in their self-interest
*  And they're allowing people to die
*  You know why I don't believe it because I don't think that way and I can't believe people are such assholes and I'm not saying
*  I'm an angel. I'm not saying I'm a better person
*  I'm saying some nice people are such assholes you can't fucking believe it and they're successful for it and they get rewarded for it
*  I also think there's people that are doing this and they've been doing this at a time where information you could hold on to it
*  You know, you could you could have secrets in a way that you can't have secret today
*  I think we're just living in a totally different world
*  totally like it used to be that
*  Being famous was the greatest thing ever and now being famous. It's not so great
*  It's like you're just a target, you know, it's like being hands
*  You still you have a voice the thing is if you can take the heat like I'm talking about
*  I'm talking about being like a famous actor or or a rock star. You're a target. Look at print the Prince of England him and that Megan
*  Marco, we're like, oh we're fucking out here. This is too much. Are they quitting the world? Yeah, they're moving to Canada
*  Blame them
*  Yeah, they're like we get the you know, the negativity she can't deal with it. That guy's a great fucking guy
*  He's a regular dude that guy Prince Harry. He's a great Prince Harry. Is he from the royal family? Yeah. Yeah
*  He's out. Have you heard this?
*  The idea of you being a royal what the fuck are we talking about? We in a Harry Potter book
*  Is this some Game of Thrones? It's so strange. You're not a royal. It's so that's not real. That's not real
*  She's the richest person in the world, but yeah who is the Queen of England? No, she's not Eddie educated
*  No, she's not. He goes to me. I don't know who has the most money
*  Did he go the people that own the you know what I'm talking about people that I don't know
*  She's the richest. I don't listen to me people that own oil in Middle East
*  There are people that are there this undocumented well because they're not public for sure
*  They don't have to be on the fucking Forbes 500. They have trillions of dollars. This is a fact
*  This is an undeniable there's people with
*  Unbelievable wealth you wouldn't be able to understand it. Yeah, I'm here Putin might have that
*  You might be a rich man the world but the Queen of England can go suck a dick
*  Fine fine people of England
*  She's a powerful lady I didn't really mean it she might be the ruler of the world that's what some people believe she might be
*  She might they might all be coming from that out Jamie
*  She might be she might be the most powerful person in the world
*  But a lot of people's oils is ridiculous man
*  You don't time the idea of someone being born into a position of power. We're not saying it's it's it's I know we're not
*  Awesome, we're just crazy that it's still real the world's here
*  We'll think about this and people are so interested in their lives just a bunch of CBD oil think about how what we're seeing now is
*  We're seeing
*  Clearly now clearly who is above the law there are people that can do whatever the fuck they want
*  We're seeing it now used to be a myth
*  Conspiracy there, but we're seeing it now who is above the law with all this is going on with Epstein and all that
*  And we're seeing how the media is backing them up to how interesting is that?
*  Hollywood backing them
*  They're playing on the hallways of the jail before they killed up
*  No, it's scary shit Prince Harry just saying what this is nonsense. I'm still young someone's gonna step away from this
*  Maybe that will change imagine if that was like the fucking beginning of the pieces that brought down the what is a little things Jenga
*  So that is Jenga. Yeah
*  Going on right now think about his uncle big shit going down his uncle with you know
*  I
*  Know yeah, yeah, well, that's just just embarrassing because he was probably banging all the girls probably
*  Probably know we got pictures. Yeah, I mean we got pictures and the lady coming out. I think that guy seems a little spectrumy
*  Yeah, you know when he's talking he seems a little off
*  To the interview you would have to be a little fucked up to grow up as a royal in that sort of environment
*  That probably is he was a victim, you know
*  Imagine like you're you're in Harlem with some crack dealer who wants to take you around and you're from the royal family
*  You're like, oh, where are we going?
*  You know, it's tight with the royal family trap house. What the trap house?
*  Oh this is not only Epstein Epstein was tied with the royal family Jimmy Savile as well. So I mean there was
*  Yeah
*  Maybe for sure
*  You know what Savile what with the dark side of him, you know, what is it there's a dark side
*  He was do he not always and yeah, and he man
*  I thought there's something darker than that. Like is there a dark side to the
*  Because he's also known as like Dick Clarke of the UK he was like, yeah, but not anymore man
*  Yeah, but a lot of story about not everybody not everybody knows Jimmy Savile
*  It most people do not know who Jimmy Savile Jimmy
*  But people in
*  Skylux look at how disgusting
*  But Eddie people in England who know who he is now know no in England but England's this
*  But in
*  England the people who knew him and grew up with him now know he was a monster and he raped
*  34 women look out look who he was typed. He raped children. He raped all kinds of people man
*  He was a monster and he was a celebrity that it's the equivalent of if we found out dick Clark was
*  Fucking all sorts of boys
*  He would he would be he would be all into raising money for mental hospitals because his he preyed on
*  Mentally ill people click on that link. This is everybody knew about Jimmy Savile. What is that?
*  Dude the Jimmy Savile store
*  Nine hours
*  Officer has spoken about some of his colleagues attitude towards Jimmy Savile in the 1960s saying that everyone in the force
*  Knew Jimmy liked them young the ex officer who wants to remain anonymous
*  Was with Leeds City Police the 1960s girls or boys it was girls and boys
*  I've never heard of them
*  This is the first time that first time
*  But in
*  Imagine if Epstein was a celebrity. Oh, wow that he did the same thing, but how long ago it was
*  60s 60s when did this news come out?
*  It came out after I died
*  But there was a lot of accusations while he was still alive in like a 60s and 70s
*  But they would just you know, he had everybody and he had everybody so nobody was gonna indict him
*  Wow, you know what I mean? It was back in the day when you can get away with something like that, you know like
*  Dark how about that journalists who infiltrated the Vatican remember that
*  Nobody needs to infiltrate the Vatican is what infiltrates
*  There's a French journalist who is gay himself who went in to basically interview the priest in the Vatican
*  Okay, so I'm doing an account of the Vatican. Well, you know, he spent a while there a while
*  Yeah years and and he came out and basically said in this book
*  He said there's there are a lot of gay priests there and there are a lot of pedophiles and both are protecting each other
*  Cuz they don't want each other to get exposed
*  You say anybody you tell me I fuck boys and I'm gonna tell people you fuck guys and if this whole and it came out
*  In the book, it's a real. Yeah, I mean it's funny interviews
*  Well, if you know the history of the Roman Catholic Church, you know Constantine is a mainstream history
*  Constantine he did he was a pagan which is can be considered Luciferian
*  Yeah, so a Vatican sexual
*  Vatican's gay overlords a sensational new book minds the Catholic Church sexual secret and he's gay
*  I'm Frank Frank will right-wing homophobes exploit it Frank Bruni's game. Yeah. Yeah. Well for a gay guy
*  It's got to be a bittersweet thing to know that the gay wizards control
*  Everything to do with the Catholic Church and even dress like gay
*  When you look at the history of the Vatican when you look at the history
*  Constantine decided to convert to Christianity because the people were leaving the people were like fuck that
*  So this is mainstream history Constantine goes. Okay. I'm no longer pagan slash Luciferian
*  I'm no longer ancient Babylonian shit where we like Christ to we're gonna do Christ. We're gonna do we got
*  We got our own we got this is mainstream. We're gonna start the Roman Catholic Church. We're gonna have a pope
*  He talks to Jesus like it's where I'm gonna have Cardinals
*  They talk to Jesus like once a week and then we have the bishops
*  And then the priests every now and then and then all of a sudden they created rock stars dudes with power
*  The Pope has power. He talks to Jesus every day Cardinals bishops priests, right? So come on back
*  We got we got Jesus for you. They made Jesus and just like you're telling us things
*  We already know no no, but what I'm saying is they were never into Jesus. It was never about Jesus
*  We know that yeah. Yeah, so when you look at the Vatican, you're like man the Constantine didn't convert to Christianity
*  No, it well maybe he did maybe didn't but that was always a debate about it
*  But there was always a debate right? So when you look at the Vatican, they have a lot of fucking Luciferian shit
*  No, look at look at the resurrection
*  Look at the sculpture of the resurrection pull that up the sculpture and you tell me if that's Jesus look up the
*  This is
*  Have you ever been to the Vatican I've seen a lot of videos on it should go you should it's amazing just to see it
*  It's pretty fucking
*  Christ
*  Their main church that does not that's supposed to be Jesus right there. There's got this is opposed
*  It looks like a Slayer album cover. Well, it's like hello. It's an artist
*  Rendering that looks like hello weights Slayer right there. So they're saying pull up the
*  Supposed to represent the resurrection of Jesus
*  How come you couldn't show the part how can we show the part where he's like in front of a meadow and he?
*  Resurrected and there's children running in the meadow. This is an artist. It's not like the Mona Lisa represents all women
*  Yeah, this is a guy's to take this is in the Vatican. This is our main church
*  But what a main church Eddie, please can I just see what that looks like? Come on, man? It's beautiful pull up
*  And Jamie Jamie same picture same they chose hell just go back to the same picture
*  They chose the part where he's rising out of hell
*  You should have chosen but is that what he's in the sky with the clouds but is Eddie is that what it's supposed to represent?
*  Yes, him resurrected from hell. He's coming out of the ground. It looks like roots
*  There's but those things in the bottom aren't faces. Okay, right are they?
*  I don't know
*  It's possible the artist felt the same way he was like
*  Use the part where he resurrected and he's on like over a meadow or something. Maybe the artist wasn't a Christian
*  But hold on a second. None of them were coming out of line. Is that the ground? What is that supposed to be? Hell?
*  How do you know he's resurrecting from hell? He went to hell and then he resurrected Jesus went to hell
*  Why would Jesus go to hell that doesn't make any sense? I don't think that's in the scripture
*  Okay, so it doesn't what is that image? All right the art behind is getting it looks like hell to me
*  It looks like a Slayer album cover the restoration of the statue of the resurrection. I've seen that has become Satan's throne
*  What is that? I've never seen the picture. He's just rising with a backup, please
*  What nuclear bomb crater who these people are crazy people? That's the Vatican. That's the main church in the Vatican
*  No, I understand that but I don't know what that represents
*  You would have to talk to the actual artist like if the Vatican hired someone to make an art piece about the resurrection
*  And this is his depiction of it
*  I don't know how much that has to say about the Vatican's position or about this guy who created either into Jesus
*  Maybe I'm jumping to by the way, I said Frank Bruni's gay. That's not the guy who wrote the book
*  That's a piece of shit. Sorry Frank Bruni
*  Look at the serpent
*  In the Vatican
*  Just figures of speeches we rudely use here in America
*  Frank Bruni to defend you though his picture he did look my friend Brian said you look gay. He just meant handsome
*  Yeah, that's all he meant. That's right. He meant gay like maybe in the Flintstones have a gay old time. Good
*  Come see me this week and I'm down with the Queen's right Queen's right. That's one of my favorite all time
*  That's in the Vatican. That's a serpent
*  Come on
*  Into Christ they're not into Christ. They want to destroy Christ. Oh, wait, that's supposed to be a snake. They're trying to destroy
*  How is that Jesus how is that Jesus right there where where is Jesus is that the Vatican that is the Vatican that is
*  Snake, you know, it's the most amazing thing about the Vatican though. It's not the Satanic shit st
*  Peter's Basilica st. Peter's Basilica took hundreds of years when you stand in the middle of it you you can't believe it's real man
*  I mean like go to that upper left corner that you got there right there Jamie right there
*  Yeah, that in you when you when you zoom in on that can't click on it doesn't clear. It's so what is that?
*  That's St. Peter's Basilica. What's it zoomed in on? It's it's a fucking enormous church. It's so bigger than that
*  It's so big. It's hard. But the snake one. How do you how do we get past that snake one? Yes
*  You know somebody over that somebody loves snakes
*  Those are the same people that came up with the Big Bang Theory same people were in the butterflies
*  They're the same people who did that the hell awaits
*  Cathedral this people was serpent Cathedral
*  It's a slothful it's the same people
*  They're trying to kill Christ. They're not trying to they're not Christian. Look at this St. Peter's Basilica
*  No power to us no no power tools no fucking cranes meanwhile, maybe they did have
*  That's the most it's amazing
*  Didn't even make it didn't make sense to me. Yeah, we were my whole family
*  We were walking around we barely talked to each other
*  Even my kids who are always like super energetic and pipe down did they were just like
*  The first thing I remember looking at and not be
*  When I go to the Venetian at Vegas, I'm like, oh my god
*  I'm like Jesus Christ go there
*  Yeah, look at that look at that dude
*  Not anymore looking at it right now is your house
*  Looking at it right now is one thing but looking at it when you're there in person it really it
*  It's one of the reasons why people were so into believing that makes this because it's so
*  Bigger than anything you've ever seen your life there if you feel like you have to be humble when you walk in
*  Yeah
*  There are paintings that were done
*  They were started by one artist and then finished by another artist because that artist died it took him and generate like it took him
*  A lifetime and then another guy took up. Yeah, it's amazing. It's the credit
*  No, they're no one. It's interesting about that
*  You know Christ done for God and it wasn't done. Nobody signs it right? It wasn't about you
*  It was about it was about the larger picture and that's the difference between architecture back then and architecture today
*  Architecture like you know today if you see it's about the architect you see these incredible structures do like, you know
*  Whatever it might be these structures that we go and visit all the time
*  We don't really know it was done by maybe one guy then another guy but with the that's never it was commissioned by a king
*  You hear about the king who finance you don't hear about the guy who built it because that wasn't the point back
*  Wasn't the Freemasons that they build everything
*  It was Anunnaki
*  Big bank theory the expansion of observable universe began with the explosion of a single particle to a definite point in time
*  Oh, we can go there. We can go there Jamie a
*  Belgian
*  cosmologist Catholic priest and
*  Father of the big bank theater. So big bank theory. So he was a
*  Cosmologist as well as being Catholic. Do you know that Brian?
*  There's the Vatican has the biggest telescopes in the world they have one called Lucifer
*  I don't think about that. They have a telescope called Lucifer
*  You've gone too far
*  How about it's real how about it's real it's that's crazy
*  No, I don't think that's true. I don't think that's the biggest telescope in the world
*  It's one of the biggest at one time or it still may be the biggest
*  It was the biggest at one time back before the Vatican the Vatican has been
*  It's a beautiful place. I love it. I was born Catholic. I was born Catholic and
*  The Catholic Church
*  I love the Cardinals. I love the bishops. I love all of your backtrack. You should you should go
*  You should go just to see how weird it is. Yeah, I've seen a lot of it man
*  And I love it, but I mean in person in person is strange
*  What does that say Lucifer instrument helps astronomers see through darkness the Vatican
*  Think I'm retarded Arizona
*  The Vatican has an observatory in Arizona
*  Let's see how big it is it's amazing the Vatican would have a Vatican is the one
*  Amazing the vet
*  Wait
*  That the Vatican would have a telescope in the name it Lucifer go to that click of that link
*  Yeah, why they name it Lucifer exactly because it's an acronym for something, but it just so happens to be Lucifer. Yes
*  Really, that's them just that's what they say
*  They say it stands for something it stands for like some kind of linear
*  You better stand for something to your fault for everything yeah
*  What does this say here
*  Large binocular telescope go make that a little larger for my shitty eyes
*  It's an optical telescope for astronomy located at 10,000 700 feet Mount Graham in
*  Pina Lea Pino, you know
*  mountains of
*  Southeastern Arizona part of the Mount Graham
*  International observatory the LBT is currently one of the world's most advanced optical telescopes at 2 a point for
*  330 inch wide mirrors blah blah blah blah blah
*  Where's the name it's the second biggest telescope you sure that's the name Eddie they call it Lucifer now, but it was
*  Oh LUC IA
*  originally Lucifer LUC I excuse me large binocular telescope near
*  Infrared
*  It's a coincidence, but they picked ones one letter to you like they picked the name Eddie Jesus Christ they had a change it
*  They picked the L
*  Skipped like four letters. That doesn't make any sense. How do they call it?
*  Exactly, that's crazy. It was a coincidence, but it really only came they only found enough letters for Lucy
*  Any any odd something here
*  What was this telescope created
*  Observatory in in Arizona the Jesuits were always but when
*  What's the art Jamie will scroll up James on the right there? Yeah
*  2004 this wouldn't they started it imagine being a part of a gigantic religious institution and
*  Naming a telescope that you could say like the god. I you call the god. Yes
*  In the meeting where they're like the top three names were like, okay, we got Jesus. I
*  We got God of light
*  How did that one get picked imagine the press
*  By Jesuits when they unveiled this telescope and they at the Vatican and they call it Lucifer
*  How did that get picked? What a what a weird?
*  that must have been
*  One guy opposed to it at least one guy
*  Sounds crazy, but look L loosen
*  you
*  universe
*  see a
*  cosmology it's a
*  Interstellar
*  Fuck
*  Earth our radius of Earth come on
*  But it's not Satan it's not Satan it's Lucifer it's a acronym
*  Okay, but we are the God the house of God and this is Lucifer. It's his enemy. It's a coincidence
*  You didn't know
*  How did the Vatican relax the Vatican didn't name a telescope Lucifer, okay is from Catholic
*  I was there but wait a minute
*  This is the damage control right here. Why was the Vatican named his telescope in Arizona Lucifer?
*  I'm a proud and devoted Catholic blah blah answer the Vatican did not name a telescope Lucifer the Vatican Observatory shares space
*  No pun intended with other organizations and groups the Vatican Observatory does not own
*  Each piece of equipment nor can I give official names or nicknames to things does not own another group
*  Installed a telescope neck and nicknamed it Lucifer that would be hilarious if you had a telescope right next to the Vatican's telescope
*  To prove the gospel like we're in hell
*  And meanwhile, okay, okay, what about the serpent cathedral with the fangs and the snake eyes
*  It's a coincidence what about the the the resurrection sculpture?
*  Well, you know the artists this serpent was the reason why we're human
*  What about Constantine was pagan and said and even the mainstream history says that he never converted that was bullshit
*  That's mainstream. So if he never converted Constantine, I thought there was a
*  Debate yeah, but there is a debate on the fact there's a political decision
*  But yeah, exactly
*  So the one theory and it's it's it's either one or the other it's he actually did convert to Christ or he just said
*  That for political purposes, but meanwhile, he was still pagan, right?
*  It's one of the other and then you start looking at the Vatican. You're like man
*  They're the ones who are creating the stuff that turned people away from the Bible
*  They created the Big Bang Theory wait if you believe in the Big Bang Theory, you're like, how could the Bible be true?
*  How could Jesus be in charge of the big bang?
*  Scientific too, right? Yeah, but it's part
*  Right, you're right
*  But if you were trying to kill if you were trying to kill religion you want everything that's opposite of the religion, right?
*  If they're because religion the Bible tells you that we're on a special
*  You saying the Catholic Church trying to kill religion
*  Didn't say that is that we're insinuating this doesn't make any sense
*  Any this has become a sacrifice that is don't hack off any dicks. Let's never said that I never said that
*  Division I got a little excited about the Catholic Church loves Jesus. What happens to the heavyweight division?
*  Thanks to pay retires
*  steepest haven't injury issues
*  Won't heal well, he's Croatian
*  I don't know. That's a lot of Europeans might be Orthodox Christian. Yeah
*  I think I think
*  20 well, what about roses truck?
*  Jarzino is a fucking monster man. That is that is a crazy fight between those two heavyweights
*  I don't think he's ready for Francis. We don't know the way he knocked
*  No one knows her and broke his face in half. Why wait throw with three seconds? Yeah, he but he did he did land
*  It Alistair fought a smart fight and we just had one mental lap. You see what my boyfriend's did Alistair. Yes, he did
*  Yes, but you also the first round consideration, you know
*  Is fighting smarter because of that fight?
*  I mean Alistair is a clever guy keeps learning the most it is as weird as it is
*  Like that guy hasn't been diminished by so many chaos. He's been killed more than anybody in UFC history
*  I don't think there's a guy that I can name
*  Maybe like Peter Aerts Peter Aerts was KO'd like some ungodly number of times
*  Yeah, a ton of competitions also make sense, but Alistair you don't see any signs dude sharp as a tick. It's weird
*  What kind of take do you have at your house sharp ones, okay, well I'm just making sure I'm also high
*  I don't think roses strikes anybody to be taken lightly. He could beat anybody
*  I don't either but it's also like
*  Man, they're both giant to you just go from zero to hundred with him
*  But well, who knows man look the shots that he took from Alistair
*  He walked him off of there were nothing that was one of the craziest aspects of that fight like leading into the fifth round
*  He was acting like Alistair over him former K1 Grand Prix champion former strike force champion former dream champion
*  One of the best heavyweights really ever if you had a 20 list of all-time great heavyweights
*  He's on both kickboxing and MMA right and roses strike is just walking through his shots
*  picks his picks his time and then
*  Closes the show in the last round but like a few seconds to go you ain't walked him through Francis's shots. No, it's different thing
*  It's a different thing. But will he fight the same way? Well, will he fight that way against now? We don't have enough on I don't know
*  I'm interested though. I want to see me too. I think it's fun
*  It's the scariest knockout artists the heavyweight divisions ever seen
*  I don't think there's anybody that comes close. He puts people in orbit that left hook on Alistair over him that punches on like anything
*  I've ever seen in all my years of watching fighting. I was so brutal so brutal and it seems like he no
*  Incredible speed and mass, you know, what's interesting?
*  Oh, it's deep a did take him if you go back and watch the steep a fat
*  I was there in person steep a ate his shots and beat him
*  Yeah
*  Well, he never caught him that clean like he did with Alistair that one time come to three times
*  Pretty fucking tasty biggest head I've ever seen on his steep a is also good at rolling with shit, you know that VIP ticket
*  What's up for that fight? You're talking about? Yeah
*  Connor the UFC. Yeah, Connor. They don't hate me. I thought they hated you know, man. They love you know, you know
*  Well, we're gonna work it out. You hug Dana yet. No, that's a no. I'm gonna get a group hug going
*  They don't do it. They don't dislike you know, I don't there's no reason there's no Godfather. There's no hate for any
*  No
*  What other divisions we got here, you know what's interesting man Jared Cannon here and Robert Whitaker
*  My thing that's a good fight
*  My thing is what are you gonna do with till though?
*  So I thought because you know style better say once you'll Romero then you got till just hanging there just be Kelvin
*  Well, I think they're setting up style better and y'all Romero. That's what I'm here
*  My position and this is not no disrespect my position that yo Romero was the uncrowned champ yo Romero
*  I think beat Whitaker in the second fight too. And then but Boricina, you know
*  There's an that that guy scares a fuck, but he's all injured. He's got a bunch of injuries, but you don't think
*  Costa Costa beat yo Romero that fight. No. No, I do think he did
*  I mean, so why would be yo Romero be the champ because no no, no, no, no
*  Yo Romero was the champ coming from the Whitaker fight. I really believe he beat Whitaker in the second fight interesting
*  He heard him back twice for sure and you know, it's just if you give those ten eight rounds
*  He wins the fight. Okay, and I think he should have gotten them
*  I think he had him on queer Street judge is so crazy. It is so crazy Whitaker and it was also over there
*  Whitaker was never in a position. We had yo Romero even remotely hurt like that
*  Okay, never had him in danger then I saw but you know, obviously
*  Whitaker loses the style better in spectacular fashion
*  But when I see yo Romero against Paul Acosta, I go well Costa obviously is next in line for a shot
*  But then Costa gets hurt. Did you lose your plug? It's right there on the floor right there Costa get hurt
*  You know, so coast is like had a couple surgeries. I think he's had bicep surgery. I think his bicep detached
*  I think is what happened see with Paulo Costa. He to me is one of the most promising guys in the vision
*  Motherfucker never gets tired. He's got a face like a goddamn fire hydrant when he beat yo Romero
*  I know it's never that I was thought he was good. I was that high. I'm there when he beat you all make Jesus Christ
*  I'm going to walk them down. What? Yeah, I think about fuck didn't give a fuck. He's a problem fucking musk
*  He's so bad. See so big. He's so big for 185
*  You're like how is it like a young Vitor not get tired like what do when I stand next to that guy?
*  Setback or cover from bicep surgery. He won't be ready to fight until spring. Yeah, so that's a serious one man
*  When your bicep tears off your bones, they got a problem. That's happened to mine
*  They didn't tear off but I was coming off my shoulders coming off
*  Restrapped that motherfucker. How about your boy stop and are called out yo, although he wants to fight some options scariest guy
*  He's like I gotta fight that guy because that guy's the guy top enters old school
*  Yeah, and he's also he looks at him like stylistically
*  He wants to find out if he could stop that fucking wrestling and that power yo well as a free well never uses his wrestling
*  But he brought he's because he gets tired. He's 50 years old if we're legit 50. We don't even know how old he might be
*  System that's what he's but his genetic he's he was so funny official word
*  47-41
*  When he was here
*  Terry not YouTube here. Yeah, they always assume the Cubans are fudging their age a little bit
*  That's always been but that's like a stereotype that's been going on since the Olympics from this race is to Phil Stevenson
*  But when you when you when he talked about when yoel Romero, you know would talk about
*  Genetics and his physique he's like go to Cuba walk around he goes everybody look like me
*  It's like it's true man. They got crazy jeans man think about how many?
*  World class boxers world-class wrestlers world-class
*  Lombard Huck to Lombard
*  They get some yes, I ran it to him at that quintet ultra show
*  Lombard dude I love that guy so fucking light is done Israel Adesanya confirms
*  He is set to defend the middleweight title against yoel Romero
*  What's the date on that they they have a name date and venue today?
*  Yo has trouble making 85 or no. Yes. He does. He's miss weight. That's why he wasn't champion
*  I mean he struggles he struggles a little bit, but I mean that's when he knocked out Luke Rockhold
*  He should have won the title. Yeah, but he's the way but he didn't didn't have the weight
*  I crushed the style bender though. I like I like I like style bender's chances in that hey man
*  You know what I do too. I think style bender's just his time clearly one of the best middleweights
*  We've ever seen dude his striking is for you. Come on. Who's mom is to me I see
*  Like a term when you see who's mon you see a terminator
*  He's going through motherfuckers when you see style bender you see like like a Bruce Lee
*  We don't see the head of the game so I motherfuckers
*  Bender though is it's very subtle you actually never see him get cat gattish nobody gets a shot
*  Well gas of course can't clean out. Oh, yes
*  No idea I saw that his face was off. That's true hit the shower that is true. That is true
*  Gasolam gasolam for his physicality and his size and what he's working with is
*  Another one of those guys like Daniel Cormier who's so impressive to me like that's one was a tank shot
*  He needs to be a 170. I think that I think so too. I think
*  Really cut for a 170
*  Nutrition yeah, he's not just so big outside of the fight
*  I think at 170 Kelvin just runs through motherfuckers. He might be the world champion
*  I think I think he'd be world champion. I believe that we just have to get him
*  I think you'd not read us like we're a plan
*  But if we if someone did get him to a real nutritionist
*  And he did it Josie Aldo style or he took his time and did it over a long period of time correctly
*  Where's he trained for Mexicans his Kings?
*  You are he's a 10th planet black
*  Yeah, he'd be champion. He trades at Kings MMA and then his jiu-jitsu transit Victor Davila
*  One of my other black house at the comedy store last night. I heard who wasn't
*  Calvin loves comedy story. Yeah, he's always there. He's a great guy. He's a great guy as well
*  Tough the nicest is he guys of all time
*  So shockingly tough though, like I look at his body. I look at him and I zero fear
*  There's no reason he should be that tough
*  There's no reason he should be able to hit guys with that much taller and he's just he's astonishing
*  Yeah, zero fear and just the nicest are you like when he got when he fights there's no anxiety
*  Never he's just he loves it
*  He wants he's like Tony like Tony him and Tony just have a star camp though for Tony, right?
*  Not quite not quite. He's always training, but he's always training
*  But I swear to God if one of those two get hurt on a few weeks freak the fuck out
*  What is Tony doing? He's not in camp. He's training
*  Bro your government recording house. No, I just
*  Just have my phone
*  Tony's always every day Tony's on his training every day man. He's just he does
*  I mean, that's his secret weapon is that
*  That's his default setting is train do cardio do some kind of shit. He's doing something every day
*  Yeah, yeah, that's those the guys that never get out of shape
*  Voskhe what about he's a monster. Oh, he's a beast. He's a guy
*  Curious to see how much Holloway I'm really curious just please go to the fucking showers
*  Sorry, I'm bad with the Russian name your I who beat your up that the Russian guy. What's his name?
*  I don't know how to kill her Piotr what pure?
*  Vasily on yawn you piece of shit seems like more and more Russians are just more Russians are coming in and fucking people up, right?
*  Different man, they have extra tendons and shit
*  Heavyweight Russian that's
*  Promise you guys yeah, no one that stands out where you look at him and you go well you oosik in boxing
*  I know what you like draw go you think about oosik moving up to like legitimate heavyweight. He's a fuck dudes up
*  You think so? I think people are scared of him. Yeah, I'm really
*  Against you know, like when you get to the top of the heap, I think he's again problems. He's too small
*  He's so talented man, there's no draw go guy like
*  This guy
*  Close thing he's gonna be sad
*  Why did heavy one fight at heavyweight and then they're already moving him into like title position? Oh, yeah, he's there
*  Yeah, I don't know him come back imagine a cabib at 205 or a cabib at heavyweight
*  So I think a beam is gonna fight at 170 before he's done
*  I really do I think he's gonna fight where he doesn't have to worry about cutting weight
*  Be him in st. Pierre at 70 then cuz he's not fighting just the boys at 70
*  Well, they would meet at 65
*  I think St. Pierre said that he could legitimately get to 65 and they could do a catchweight fight to be we go 70
*  Yeah, yeah, what a fight that would be could be even GSP at 65
*  37
*  He still wants to fight for sure. Yes, and he's one of those guys like Tony. He's consistently active
*  I bought a lot of thick against biz being you look great. He said he had a real problem for that fight
*  Too much
*  Yeah, yeah, so he's
*  Doing a lot of water exercises
*  He had he puts these GSP puts these things on his hands and his feet
*  He does all these crazy I used to do it with them. Yeah, we used to it
*  We used to it in Laguna Niguel. It'd be our workout would be in the pool for an hour and he has these things
*  It's just like you're doing sprints. No, it's like it's almost like these these hand you grab these hand
*  Just yeah, and what does it do?
*  It's a workout for your shoulders your condition. It's a fucking on this I can hear what he's saying
*  Can we get some volume? Damn? What are those things? He has in his hands and also improve the core strength
*  So what I'm gonna do is I use the pool. I try to be in a place where it's not too deep
*  If the depth of the pool is not good enough
*  Like like this right now. I try to submerge myself to the shoulder
*  Then what I do is I I I make a punch and I go it's relation reverse nation in the same time as I'm doing it
*  Yeah, okay, but also all schooling
*  It's not easy fuck that's why he's got a stiff jab that's the jab right there
*  There's also no punishment on your bones or body. That's cool. You say 230 or 240
*  30
*  Fucking legs, he's got huge legs. It's homing jeans. Don't look at his legs, dude
*  How about that video I sent you that guy live streaming the war? Oh
*  Jesus Christ that depressed me
*  Fuck man
*  World yeah
*  What was that like hey
*  When was that I don't think so if it's not like 10 years ago something now, I think that's real reason
*  I don't know. I don't know. I'm gonna send it to you haven't seen it. Oh, you saw it. It was in the group chat
*  Yeah, I saw it's fucked up. Yeah, she could be easily fake these days
*  Oh
*  Blow shit up now, right, but I don't think that was fake to $2.50
*  We also have dudes who are actually fighting in a war who have cell phones and then there's they're actually
*  Look behind look behind oh
*  Bro, that shit is real as real as fuck. I just don't know if this is what American troops
*  Probably does it say Jamie?
*  I
*  Hope they didn't you probably better off without your seat belts is that American or what is
*  He was I mean the guys who got hit look like they were probably not on our side
*  But I don't know that looks like an ID or something. Damn. I don't know
*  I just hope nothing happens with this. I ran shit. Nothing's gonna happen. Nothing's oh, well now that Eddie said it
*  I know you've kept up
*  Iran's vested interest. No, I do something
*  You know what? I mean we talked about this early what actually happened is when they bombed when I ran like they swore revenge
*  They were that red flag and they were gonna bomb twice they bombed and they killed nobody but in their media
*  They reported that they killed 30 Americans. So it looks like a real retaliation face
*  It's all about
*  It all comes down
*  Do we're surrounding or we got military bases all around around? What are they gonna do now?
*  That was I know that I feel like I feel like
*  If if the intelligence hadn't come back that there was something imminent that this guy we knew this guy was he was in
*  Baghdad yeah, he wasn't a terrorist guys a serious thing that were in our interest
*  No, no, we do know that going back to actually Bush to we know that he he was
*  Mastermind of a lot of this. Yeah
*  You need to be taken out controlling Hezbollah trying to set up those kinds of states and all these other states
*  So if Trump wouldn't have taken him out then the loony left would be going after him for not taking them out
*  Well, well, here's the thing also Trump has been very disengaged with the Middle East
*  He's like I don't want to be involved in the Middle East you want to pull the troops out
*  I always I agree with this policy and I think that Iran got emboldened and started becoming more active in
*  The spheres of influence that we are trying well what happened was is they made a lot of deals while Obama was in office and
*  Trump was like reneging and all that he's like who made these stupid ass deals. So Iran's like fuck you
*  I thought we had a deal Trump's like fuck that deal that deal goes against the United States
*  So fuck all that so that's what's going on
*  so it the rumor is the rumor is that the
*  The president of Iran wasn't getting along with Soleimani
*  Anyways, so Trump said said I got you let's take him out. I'll do you a favor
*  I look like a bad motherfucker and then you say we're gonna get revenge you bomb a base that has nobody you
*  That's very clean. You claim that there's 30 people and everybody in Iran goes we got revenge
*  I can see that and then everybody's fine. I can see that nobody wants what what nobody wants. What what three day?
*  Who's working night you're working working the night both around the same
*  I gotta go see my kids for me, too. I got my son to bed. None of you bitches are going anywhere
*  Three fights
*  Six o'clock, you don't have nowhere to be
*  715 show
*  So who does vacating the flyway title so make sure Joseph been a
*  Joy shot at the title against a Brazilian gentleman who?
*  Pulled his name Jamie. I'm gonna fuck up the pronunciation stuff to remember any flyways
*  Can we talk about Connor and cowboy we already did but you weren't here
*  I talked to Luke Thomas about it for an hour straight
*  Go either way, maybe I mean I got the fuck no figure eight. Oh, yeah, that's right
*  Davidson figure. Oh, that might be the last one of the division
*  Dangerous dude, man, you know Joe Benavides been training 10th planet the last couple years
*  I don't know if you know that has you where which case is yet 10th planet Las Vegas with KC Hallsteads is coach nice
*  So Joe as a person
*  My favorite people and I feel like you know for him
*  He had a ACL tear how to go through surgery came back and then the titles kind of been in limbo
*  I had a close fight with Henry sahoota man split decision. Yeah, very close fight. Didn't he win
*  Yes, he won. He'll beat Henry pseudo. He's one of the few guys who beat her pseudo
*  So if anybody deserves a shot at the title is Joe Benavides for sure
*  I'm real interested in that rematch in Volkanovsky and Max, but yeah, that's happening immediately
*  I don't know what imagine you would have a rematch
*  Rematches like what Max is that means I got I need some time. I'm gonna rest
*  Maybe you want to do in Australia listen Volkanovsky wants to rest too. I think I said that was a guy
*  Here's the thing about 145 people people talk about 55 people talking about 70 people talk to it
*  145 in the UFC that might be the deepest division bro. How about the Korean zombie taking out Frank Yeager quick?
*  I was surprised Korean zombie. Yeah. Yeah, you're Rodriguez. You got your boy fucking the
*  45 but you also five you also beats the free Calvin cater who almost took out to beat in the third correct Brian Ortega
*  But Calvin cater is now gonna fight Jeremy Stevenson
*  That's a crazy fight do that Calvin cater is the dark horse
*  Beat beat him and is that no no, let me tell you something's a beat if that was a five round fight
*  It's a beat was in trouble big trouble third round. He was getting started
*  He was he was getting started on his bike
*  You watch the interview the post fight interview
*  Which I've just watched the whole fight and the interview this week and at the end of the fight
*  He was heaving breathing
*  I said I did not expect him to fight after me so hard in the third round
*  And he took him down at the end of the third round just held on and while he's just holding on
*  Calvin cater is battering him from the bottom. He didn't try to get back up
*  He just punished him from the bottom and Zabit did zero damage with that take down for 45 is the best division
*  Fucking dangerous and he's getting better. He's getting better and better better. He starts Ricardo Lomas. He's a fucking beast
*  What do you guys think about Bryce Mitchell? Is he is he rising at 45 or is it 55?
*  I
*  Want submission of the year with the with the
*  Twister yeah, he's 55 right? Oh, isn't he 45? I
*  Don't know how many fights you have in the UFC right now. I don't know man. All I know is that he's
*  Said he learned it online
*  Did you see his interview with the field on no dude you got to watch that interview with Theo von
*  It's two dudes from fucking Arkansas and Alabama, Louisiana
*  It's hilarious. That's it. He's like he's a Theo von of the UFC
*  He's a panther shorts
*  He's hilarious. I love that guy. Um sugar Sean O'Malley's finally get back in the game. He fought in quintet. He got ya
*  Yeah, fuck you guys got fun bro speaking about getting fucked over. How about Cubs wants and rolling with Jake Shields? Yeah
*  I didn't hear did you guys watch his ACL explodes? You got to get on you see five pass and watch quintet ultra
*  That was a
*  Cubs fights at 145 Jake obviously when MMA was fighting was fighting 170. He's way bigger guy
*  He's a bit he's probably big and he had a ridiculous reap like it was a
*  Exaggerated reap on that leg man. It was like wait, and it wasn't even a reap in between the legs
*  It was a reap across the hip and blue cub shell dude. His leg just blew out
*  Exploded really fucked up explode wasn't even a submission. It was in the process of yeah
*  It was so bad, man. It was so bad. He's pop and you see
*  He falls down then you look in the cub James that man married kids only source of income
*  Gonna be out for a year
*  Yeah, how about that? How about that? You just laying there for a grappling match?
*  You're you just beat chrome Gracie and now you're in a position where you're out 100% for a year at 36
*  It sucks, but I'm not fucking do a grappling match if I was a world-class MMA fighter
*  Don't say that don't fuck with grapple and I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it
*  Worth it. That's right. That out Jamie. No, it's not worth it
*  Again the Queen of England
*  Marijuana is illegal in your country ma'am. Hey, listen, I will say this when the Queen was 19. She's like look her up
*  Stunning now it's even worse
*  Sexualized her now you've gone too far
*  Pornographized and she was super nice
*  I don't think that world-class fighters should be fucking jet-skiing and I don't think they should be fucking jumping motorcycles over cliffs
*  Cowboy says hold my friend. I know I know it does everything. I should be able to do whatever he wants
*  I like if I was if I was tight with cowboy, I would say dude. It's not worth the risk
*  He obviously he doesn't care and he would laugh and he'll laugh my face. That's who he is man
*  He is we is but like legitimately you look at Cubs wants and that guy just ran into a
*  Giant problem that shouldn't have existed the position wouldn't have been available in MMA the way it was in
*  You know in training though with Cub to but he wouldn't be grabbed
*  I'm so over competitive manner against a guy who was 30 pounds larger than him. Yeah. Well Jake is so strong
*  Jackson's though. I'm sure he works with big guys. It was a freak thing
*  It could happen but it was competition
*  In training it could have happened in practice, but less likely it was a freak thing
*  It was a freak thing. It was a great show though
*  So Gordon Ryan really retire. Is that real? I think so. I think so. Why not right?
*  It's do MMA though, right? You should well, I thought he said he was all I know
*  All I know is he was on a trip road trip doing seminars everywhere selling out and shit and then something happened
*  There he decided he was like, you know what let me slow down and enjoy life what a baller that's what he said
*  That's what he said. So I don't know. I for maybe 24 maybe some mushrooms or something
*  The best in the world you don't get to go at 24, you know, like I
*  Tell us again about Bohemian Grove. Yeah
*  Fuck
*  That video was very blurry dude
*  Oh shit, he says a cornfield
*  Being retired gives me an opportunity span on things
*  To focus on while I was trying to be the best excited learn, you know what as far as
*  Jiu-jitsu, he's like he's done. He's done. He's done more than most people. So if he wants to retire he can retire
*  I'm out fuck it dude. I'm over this jiu-jitsu thing. I'm gonna do this what he could do seriously
*  All he needs to do is just open up a school. He'll have 400 500 students
*  Make about six seven to sixty seventy grand a month and it'll be a nice
*  He wants to teach no no, he wants to teach does he all he's got to do is open a school
*  He'll have three four hundred students easy. He'll make 60 70 K a month easy and it'll just be chillin
*  Just training guys. That's the easy life. Hey Brian. He's already he's already beaten fucking pretty much everybody out there

*  I like it at once. I'm trying to juice it back up to I'm trying to bring everybody over there
*  I'm like, hey guys like we can go both places
*  You could do an eight o'clock at the improv of ten o'clock at the store
*  Bounce back and forth fuck a lot factor not really this enough gravy to go around for two two great clubs
*  I think I like the way they handle things at the improv. They're nice people, you know, the people that run it are cool
*  I've been going there forever and they kind of took me in after I left the store
*  So I feel obligated to like continue to perform totally totally. Yeah. Yeah, I like it there man
*  Page is awesome. Reed is awesome. The people that run it are awesome. It's cool
*  And it's right across the street from a weed store
*  I did improv once and that factory once the improv show I did with Tony Hinchcliffe. He had his friend show that one great
*  You know has Alabama bit about how yes
*  Don't give it up. But yes, dude, Larry
*  It just so happened that that week I had ten motherfuckers from Alabama 10th Planet Decatur, Alabama
*  Come in and come to see me do a live show at the improv
*  They were all there from Alabama and three of them were cops. Oh, no, they're mad at Tony. No, no, they loved it
*  But come on
*  He's got that Alabama bit it's a funny bit
*  Yeah, it's it's amazing and they all loved it. They all loved it. Have you seen his me too movie bit? No, I'm not saying nothing
*  We'll talk later. I love Tony Hinchcliffe. He's a fucking beast swinging that guy's a beast kid swinging
*  Oh hard man. I've known Tony for a long time. He works hard like we were talking about earlier
*  I I really am happy that the comedy scene is slowly getting
*  braver with jokes
*  It seems like it's a weird thing because in the 80s it was a like the cool thing to be a liberal and I'm Democrat
*  Republicans they just they're just Christians. They have family values
*  They don't want to get higher go to heavy metal concerts fuck Republicans
*  But as you get older and you have kids and I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened, but it seems like now
*  The cool kids are Republicans. Would you know that expression?
*  Show me a young man who's not a liberal and I'll show you a man with no heart
*  Show me an old man who's not conservative and I'll show you a man with no brain
*  There you go, there's certain aspects of me that have become more conservative as I've got older
*  I've like appreciate hard work more
*  I I understand like the mental pitfalls involved in self pity and a lot of family values
*  Man, that's the number one thing because when I grew up there were no family values and I thought family values is a way to control
*  You they're trying to control you with the family values in Christ. Yeah, and the older you get you're like
*  I was a fucking idiot. Of course, it's all about family
*  You gotta have values a dude with no values is a dude you can't trust worth the shit
*  I ain't trust it's also when you have something to lose
*  You realize that everybody has something to lose and it puts you in like you commiserate with all the other people that also have
*  Families, you know, you all feel that's one thing when you go to like family gatherings and everyone's got their kids
*  Like you feel about their kids the way you feel about your kids
*  Look out you're going near the stairs like you don't
*  This is what communities and tribes used to be like, yeah, like we gravitate towards that. It's good for everybody
*  Yeah, it's a you know what? I used to think growing up that giving into your desires was like that's your right
*  That's my right if I'm horny, I'm gonna fuck if I want a party. I'm gonna drink and these fucking
*  right-wing people from Alabama
*  They're trying to throw Jesus down my throat and try to push, you know
*  I'll push their family values and but I swear now dude, I'm not Republican
*  I'm not claiming Republican at all or anything, but I get it now
*  I get it cuz I have a kid and there's no way
*  Anybody is gonna convince me that because some fucking kid with pink hair all
*  Looped up on pharmaceuticals shoots up a mall that it makes sense that I give up my guns and I can't protect my family
*  These are long complex
*  We're gonna get explain that to me gonna get in the weeds that we branch off in all these different directions
*  But I know what you're saying is like as you get older, especially when you have family
*  But what it's made me is what it's made me way more
*  Compassionate and way more understanding. I'm still not great at it. I still fuck up sometimes
*  I'm I'm a human, you know humans fluctuate. We don't we're not a perfect thing but
*  Overlying when my boat rights itself when I figure out where my head is really at my thought process is always I
*  Want things to be better for everybody?
*  Like I think it's possible that if we all work together everything could be way smoother
*  There could be less lows and really high and highs. There would be some smooth
*  Level ground we can help each other
*  The problem is when some people have nothing and other people have everything and it looks like chaos and then there's a battle between
*  ideas and then people want you to comply and there's there's so much crazy shit that's going on as you get older and like
*  People are looking for control of something. It's ultimately your life, which is uncontrollable. Well, what you're saying is a hundred percent correct
*  Everything you're saying is right the problem in that would fuck what fucks everything up is
*  People getting blackmailed and people being compromised and those are the people that are making the laws and they are those laws
*  Affect my family. That's where it gets all fucked up because everything you're saying is right
*  But that's not what these people these certain people not everybody
*  There's a lot of good people in the government a lot of good people and it's a mate
*  I'm fat. I'm fascinated every day finding out who they are and then boom you group them all together
*  Those are the good guys those are the bad guys let's watch then you make your popcorn and you watch the fucking show
*  You know what I mean?
*  And every now and then you say something that because it's affecting my family. So anytime someone says, oh, there's a school shooting now
*  Immediately, let's take away the guns like dude. That is the most retarded
*  Solution to these mass shootings is take a take away my right to defend my family
*  I understand what you're saying. I understand what you're saying and I agree with you
*  But I understand why they would come to that conclusion
*  especially if they don't
*  Understand what does happen if you look at a place like I mean
*  I don't want to say Hong Kong should have guns because if then they did they would throw away their
*  Tyrannical rulers they wouldn't have to just protest in the streets in mass with hundreds of thousands of people for months and months at a time
*  I'm not saying that they should be up shooting people
*  You've seen those videos in Hong Kong where the police are shooting protesters, that's what I'm talking about
*  But this is that this is the other side of the coin
*  That's a different level the thing about school shootings and protests and tyrannical governments is that humans are messy. There's no
*  Clear simple answer. It's like look if you want to if you have a small fire in front of you
*  And you have a bucket of water and you want to put out that fire. There's a very very easy to get to answer
*  It's right there. It's a bucket you throw the bucket of water on the fire. It puts the fire out. No one would argue that
*  the problem with all these really subtle nuanced complicated
*  Super complex problems is there isn't one answer to it. There's a but like the the issue of
*  Gun violence, you know, I had a tweet that I put out a lot was probably my most liked tweet ever that I said
*  that
*  What was the exact tweet what did I say about gun control is a we oh we have a
*  mental health issue described
*  disguised as a gun control issue and tyranny described described as
*  As government I forget how I said it but the point being that this is a mental health issue
*  it's not an issue of of
*  Guns as much as people the country has a mental health problem disguised a gun problem and a tyranny problem disguised as a security problem
*  Well, everything you're saying is correct. But the problem is it's not about
*  Getting it's not about doing the right thing to these these people that are in positions to make these laws. They're
*  They're they are using these events
*  To push their gun
*  Confiscation laws they are that's what's going on
*  So you're talking common sense you're talking common sense, but it's not common sense with these people
*  These people are just like oh we could use that boom push another executive order boom little by little inch by inch
*  We're gonna take their fucking guns away. You had a guy on just the other day Ed Calderon
*  I took a little like one minute little piece of your podcast and I put it on my social media today this morning
*  And it was him saying I love this country
*  I'm new to this country, but there's a there's a couple things where I see it headed that I'm not into and you're like
*  What like what like what and he goes well
*  I left my country because I didn't have the right to protect myself from the bad guys
*  It was the government and the criminals, you know now here you guys got that right and and now you guys it's like being threatened
*  Because that's not good coming from where I came from
*  Trust me. You want to be able to protect your family?
*  It just all comes down to that give me a reason explain to me how giving up my guns
*  Make sense in protecting my family if you give me a good reason then I'll give them up. I haven't heard a good reason yet
*  Well, it's a plea to emotions because the reality is when you look at the number of guns versus the number of incidents
*  I don't I don't want to diminish anybody's death or anybody's family members death
*  But the number of guns in this country is fucking staggering when you compare it to the number of actual
*  Gun violence incidents or mass shooting instance. It's relatively small
*  And then the problem is when you compare the number of those people who are mass shooters
*  You look at that number versus what percentage of them were on drugs
*  Psychiatric drugs and it's fucking gigantic. Yeah, I don't say that that's the cause
*  Yeah, I'm not saying that's the cause but if there's one correlation that we all need to look at
*  That's one of them man. Yeah as much as guns the way I look at it is like to me
*  All that matters is my son and my wife. I don't care what happens at that school
*  I'm or that mall or that school or that mall or that school or that mall. I know is here
*  I want to protect my family. I know I'm gonna protect them
*  But you want to say you care about your community about your friends. You care about a lot of people
*  This is that thing that people get to when they get like real
*  Defensive and scared when they really worry about the outside world they said that just about us is about us is about us
*  I just want to protect my family
*  I understand you do but we shouldn't even have there shouldn't be a concern and I think if everybody lived in harmony
*  They'll be way less of a concern about some utopia that it's it's too late to achieve this gun-free utopia
*  That's a not talking about gun-free utopia. No, I would never say that. Okay, I mean
*  No, I'm the opposite. I think that a well-armed
*  Society is a polite society. Yeah, I really do. Texas is one of my favorite places to go and it's an interesting experiment
*  I'm not saying no church
*  Everyone comes out though old lady came out. So yeah, exactly
*  That's what I'm talking about. You remember my bit that I used to have about the draw Muhammad contest that they did in Texas
*  There's a Charlie Hebdo, you know the magazine Charlie Hebdo was this magazine in Paris and they did a cartoon about Muhammad
*  You're not supposed to draw Muhammad. Well, they killed everyone that worked it killed like nine people. They killed police officer
*  It was a really big issue huge international issue. Everybody was in terrified. Everybody's like fuck
*  Did that have something to do with South Park? Listen, listen, no, no
*  The New York Times wouldn't draw the pictures. They wouldn't do wouldn't print the pictures
*  The Los Angeles Times wouldn't print the pictures Washington Post wouldn't print the pictures
*  No one was doing anything then Texas got into the mix and they decided to have a draw Muhammad contest
*  Instantly within within minutes a dude showed up in with his friend they started shooting at the building
*  They were killed almost instantly and I'm like why because they were doing a draw Muhammad contest in Texas
*  I'm like, did you pay attention to anything about Texas? And then I get this whole bit about how this the place where they
*  Know that bit about more tigers in captivity in Texas and all the wild the world. What's the bit?
*  From triggered from my 2016 special
*  But there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than all of the wild of the world
*  That's how crazy Texas is Texas is Wild West people who just said we're going right here
*  When they just stopped all those kit Carson type dudes from the fucking Wild West
*  They just stopped in Texas and they stayed there. There's more tigers in Texas than the whole rest of the planet. That's insane
*  It's insane. They're in dudes yards. Yeah, that's what's insane and I go it all started with one guy
*  We got a tiger the other guy's like I didn't know we're good tigers shit
*  And he went got two tigers and the first guy was like I ain't about to let this faggot out tiger me
*  And he and he opened up tiger world and that's literally what it's like down there
*  Dudes have hundreds of tigers in their yard. That's crazy
*  You can have a yard and if you have the resources you can keep those tigers fed you can have fences
*  We have a hundred tigers in your yard
*  Texas is a different animal son, but it's one of the safest places to be it's one of the it is violence in Texas
*  Just like there's violence whenever you get large groups of people. Yeah, but I like people in Texas. They're friendly Dallas
*  I like Dallas a lot man. They're like Austin. I like you. I like everywhere
*  I go in Texas, but they're fucking there. They're what I would want America to be like their cordial. They hold doors for you
*  They say good morning. They look in the eye. They're smiling Texas is
*  Not only the best place in the United States for me for a jujitsu seminars, but also comedy to Texas
*  Texas is a different animal comedy
*  Hundred people show up for seminars. It's it's insane man. I did my first CD in Texas
*  Yeah, it's Houston at the last Houston is the best place. That's the number one. Oh man. Well Dallas and Houston
*  I don't know man. I love Austin to do when there's a crowd when I see a crowd of
*  Mexican
*  Berset there is
*  They try to breach those subjects go hey stop stop stop stop I can't I can't do that I'm gonna he's crazy
*  Then what you should really listen to Eddie about the people that make tunnels under the earth my hey hey hey
*  Hey, bro, I gotta go home. I got a yoga class like 30. I like when people come out to me
*  I got people coming up to me and and
*  They're like all alien that they still think I'm the 2005 dude
*  You've evolved aliens
*  Been we were we've evolved from aliens in the split the whole Anunnaki story man
*  It's hard for they're so into it. It's like when how do I tell this guy that I don't believe in this shit?
*  You know what I had a guy the other night
*  I was just like I'm not gonna say nothing no more because I guess fucking aliens
*  Our DNA was split
*  Doing bong heads and watching documentaries
*  Nobody nobody
*  Watch maybe there's a lot of ties. Maybe there's a fucking
*  100-way tie a thousand way time, but it's very hard to watch more space documentaries than me and you
*  Come on real space documentaries to not just alien one we would just sit there, and there's like 12 parts to like this BBC
*  Universe remember that giant alien bong that I had yeah yellow fish bong red band has that thing nobody was into space and
*  Aliens more than us now you had that fucking Roswell poster on
*  The newspaper clip
*  Dude we were balls deep in that shit
*  Let me tell you something man it got fired up on I again when I watched that Bob Lazar documentary
*  When Bob Lazar was saying things in the 1990s that became true in the late in the 2000 teens
*  In terms of like element 115 that they had this thing that they could propel these spaceships with and they were saying there's no such
*  Thing he's like there's a thing they have it. It's from another planet. He explained the propulsion system
*  Explained all this stuff. It sounds like such nonsense, but I believe Bob Lazar believes all that shit
*  I believe he don't believe it's true. I believe he's set up
*  They let him talk too much like how they're gonna let him do Netflix and they're gonna come on JRE
*  They're gonna let him do go on Larry King again Eddie Bravo with the 3d chest they want him to do that
*  It's if you're on Netflix
*  They want the deep state wants you on Netflix, so it's a good thing
*  It's a good thing too. I think he believes it, you know, just like William Cooper
*  I think he he figured out he got set up they were trying to get him to believe that
*  alien spacecraft
*  And all that cuz he would his job at the Office of Naval Intelligence William Cooper. He wrote behold a pale horse
*  He wrote that book. He's like probably considered the helio Gracie of conspiracy theories William Cooper
*  He was in charge of putting together the documents for these
*  top secret
*  Naval Office of Naval Intelligence meetings and he was reading them and going was he killed in a shootout?
*  They shot his ass dude, but he was killing a shootout like in front of his house
*  He was talking too much he predicted Osama bin Laden before 9-eleven. I don't know if you know this
*  There's video on YouTube you can watch as William Cooper so, you know, it's gonna be an attack
*  He goes out space about like bases on the moon where aliens had base
*  He evolved he you got it. You got to follow the time sort of like you're not into aliens anymore
*  And now he really don't know because he's a big part of it. He's a big part of it of what?
*  he's a big part of me going oh cuz he
*  He is the one who?
*  Opened my eyes to the fact that he thought he was being set up
*  Into he thought they're trying to get us to believe in aliens so they could fake an alien attack
*  So that'll usher in the New World Order cuz what happens if the aliens attack?
*  We all unite and all the movies you see them in the movies like oh they're attacking let's call China China's got this new
*  Thing and the Russia and then we're all together. We all unite. That's the whole purpose of everything
*  It's always been about everything. There's so many pieces. How do we do this?
*  But wait a minute, who's the master fucking puppeteer? That's too long
*  I would need an hour to explain all that that's too long. That's too much. That's too long. That's too long
*  But William Cooper he was the guy who he was like aliens exist. I'm looking at these documents
*  They're having these meetings about this crash alien
*  Aircraft so he's out at he's got his own little private radio and like or not private radio
*  But I don't like in the late 80s early 90s. He's on radio
*  Whatever that before the way before the oh, yeah, some sort of show and then he's like oh these motherfuckers are setting me up
*  There's this is all bullshit he goes they they're setting up a fake alien invasion. That's what they're doing
*  Okay, that's that's you know who I've been trying to get on the podcast recently. Yes, Esther Hicks
*  Really? Yeah, you still alive. Yeah, still live not interested
*  her uh her husband passed I believe
*  I'm sorry if that's incorrect. Yeah, you know, she's that lady that channels that dude. I was I used to be way into her
*  Yeah, I was in here's the thing about someone like that
*  It's almost like
*  The universe is throwing you a puzzle like you can extract valuable information
*  Out of this puzzle, but you got to understand what's edible and what's not when you eat a coconut you don't eat the outside
*  You eat the inside the inside has that beautiful white meat and it also has a delicious coconut milk
*  Those those things are good the outside you can't eat
*  there's a lot of people that will tell you things and
*  Some of those things seem like bullshit
*  but inside those things is some undeniable truths about how we should live our lives and how we should view the world and how we
*  Can sort of you unite each other with love and understanding and we can
*  Connect in a way. It's a like a murder mystery. Let's all figure out life, right?
*  But it's it is like a murder mystery
*  It's more probably more complicated because it's never over murder mysteries haven't any right life is just as long as there is life
*  Most people man, I know some people they're so happy
*  They the last thing on their mind is trying to figure out what the fuck this is all about
*  They're just living their life and it's all about their family and they don't give a shit about Iran
*  They don't give a fuck about NASA. They're just living their life and man. I envy that shit
*  I am trying to move closer to that. I envy that shit. Hey, you know what people tell me, you know, like are you oh, that's all
*  you do is
*  Study conspiracy theories and I'm like no on the weekends dude on the weekends
*  I am blue pill in myself on the weekends baseball with my son karate
*  We've got the fucking watching the Disney cartoons with all the space shit in it
*  I we I blue pill with a fuck out of I don't try to get my son into
*  Conspiracy theories at all. That's gonna be later. I'm like, I just want that's gonna be later as later
*  I'll get him when he's like 15 15 15, but right now he can't handle it. There's no way there's no way
*  Ask him to and all his whole life every minute is happiness just
*  Love and happiness and we just we just want to make him every day. He loved school more than anything
*  He loved school more than fucking he loved school and then after school
*  It's all about fun and he decides what we're gonna do. He calls the shots. You're gonna go to karate
*  Because today we're gonna do karate and then we're gonna cuz he's all in the baseball too
*  And then we're gonna go to the batting cages my boom. That's it
*  We go to karate batting cages that I go teach jujitsu then the next day. He'll say daddy
*  I think we're gonna I'm gonna take a relaxation day worked a lot the last couple days

*  And then we'll watch some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He's all about teenage
*  He decides and then every day it's a different thing what he wants it. Let's go to the movies today after school
*  Of you learning from like the pain of your childhood and like doing all the right thing I do the opposite with my dad
*  My dad had 19 kids and I was just one kid with my mom was like a weird
*  Offside like he had a family with five kids and then he got a bunch of other women pregnant
*  He was all over the place truck driver. He had 19 kids. I was one of 19 yet out of eight different chicks
*  he was banging and
*  He never I found out I met I met a couple of my half brothers and half sisters that were were actually part of his
*  real family and
*  We met one day we went to the old spaghetti factory in in Hollywood and he told they told me all about him
*  And I didn't know I thought he had five kids
*  He had a family with five kids and my mom was some chick, you know, he was seeing on the side
*  That's what I thought. I didn't know he had a bunch of others goes how much they go
*  She goes how many my half sister goes how many I was happy my half sister half brother
*  How many kids do you think your dad has?
*  I said six. It's not try 19 damn
*  I go he's like Hilly old Gracie. Holy shit real similar and one thing that he never told anybody
*  He never said the words. I love you to anybody to his like real family
*  He never said it to me because I would seem like once a year that the words never came out of I never told
*  My mom that apparently he's one of those guys that will never say I love you to anybody and I'm the opposite
*  Dude, I tell my son I look him in the eye every day
*  So, you know who loves you the most, you know, I'm gonna I love you the most
*  And I whispered is your mic, you know, I'll kill anybody for you. Don't you ever forget that? Well, we're getting crazy
*  Oh, I get crazy with him every day. It is important. Yeah, why I was going people know that you and then it's a funny thing
*  Good now it's a funny thing like first he's like, okay dad
*  Okay, and now I go say I'm not gonna let you forget daddy
*  I won't forget I call you promise cuz I won't forget I go I just want to make sure you don't forget
*  And he goes okay because I daddy I won't forget I promise
*  Every day
*  You know you've really embraced to be the dad it's all that matters man, I'm living for him
*  My that's why I shaved my head. I'm like, what the fuck am I doing washing my hair?
*  I didn't have this
*  Transplant scar in the back of my head. I would have shaved my head a long time ago
*  But I just decided like this is so pointless it looks terrible keep paying to get hair cut
*  They always look like shit. Everybody online is calm like telling me I'm turning Joe Rogan
*  I love those comments. I love them anybody talk like stupid shit
*  Like it's obvious that like they're like hate me
*  I do them a favor and I decide to save their life and I just block them because I'm like that much hate
*  Dude, you're gonna get fucking cancer following me, bro. You know, I need to block you and save your life
*  Well, there's just a lot of people that want attention and they're not getting it at home much like you or me look
*  Did I could I like to save them? I that's a beautiful thing
*  But I could have easily been a hater if I was 15. I had an internet account
*  Yeah, I could easily be the crazy the internet dude
*  Anybody can come out and just fuck and say whatever I'm saying if I was a good 15 year old kid and I could comment
*  And you you made me feel jealous and I didn't have any love at home and I saw you like doing all the jujitsu videos
*  And I would go fuck that guy. The guy sucks, you know, how about Leo Vera? I would just send you some mean shit
*  I would send you some mean shit. Yeah, just as a 15 year old piece of shit
*  Yeah, but that's just because you're a 15 year and because you're not really talking
*  It's a bad way to talk to people man through text messages and shit. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense
*  We're supposed to look at each other you know when people say obvious things that that
*  Translate into positivity and and it's obvious there. They're on the same frequency as me
*  I follow every one of those dudes anybody comment something that it says like genuinely
*  They they agree with what I'm saying and they're on my team like you're on my motherfucking team
*  If someone says if someone says anything if they if they criticize me, I won't block them. I'm like if it's legit
*  I'm like I get that I get that but if it's clear
*  That you're a hater. I might do let me save your life. Let me block you
*  Let me put a couple years on that life
*  I don't I don't let any of those as soon as you as soon as you expose yourself
*  I'm like dude, you should not be following me. There's a bunch of other people you could be following dude
*  It's obvious. You don't like me
*  Find someone else. Well, there's two schools of thought right this school's thought you should let everybody in
*  And oh and there's the other school of thought is that it's like a party
*  Like if you had a party and one dude's assholes rule kick him out kick him the fuck out
*  But this is my party. Yeah, it's your party. Yeah. Yeah, I think that
*  You want to criticize me intelligently? I never blocked those people ever. I would feel like a douchebag
*  I wouldn't do that if you criticize me, but you're being intelligent about it and you're not being a dick about it
*  I'm like, okay, let let people argue about that. Okay, let them whatever, you know
*  But if you come out say you fucking piece of shit you're retarded like dude, let me save your life
*  That's some ozone therapy I did some ozone therapy and not in you know what that is yeah, it's like
*  You know what? This is what happened. I did when I went down there to Mexico
*  I went down there for five days and the I didn't do stem cells till the third day
*  It's like you had to prep yourself for the stem cells. We didn't
*  Just
*  Juicing the gerson diet is like dude. It's uh, what is the gerson gerson gerson? It's the gerson therapy
*  It's what saved how he was guys man. How many last good had colon cancer and he did the gerson diet gerson therapy
*  How does it work you juice you have to take fresh juices like there's certain plant juices plant juices
*  You have to make them yet
*  And you you do one like every hour and you do a coffee enema like five times a day
*  Yeah, so juicing coffee enema juicy coffee enema. Do I coffee enema?
*  Juicing coffee and all day. No not not like like someone with cancer would do someone with cancer
*  You got there's a for do for three months, dude every day. You're juicing coffee enemy
*  You're just cleaning out something about it work. Tell ya
*  Vasquez is cancer-free and it was from the juicing it was from the gerson therapy
*  So is that all he's doing for nutrients is just juicing and then coffee. I don't know. Maybe who knows?
*  I don't know. I don't know the details. This is what hobby that's part of it part of these juicing school is thriving
*  He's teaching jujitsu. He tells me he beat it
*  You know, I don't know the the facts. I just go by what he tells me. I see him on Instagram
*  He's teaching jujitsu. He told me did the gerson therapy
*  He told me what it was about and when I went to Mexico
*  That's what that's one of the things they do cuz this is the weird thing is I went down to cancer
*  Alternative hospital down in in Mexico called Chipsa and people thought I had cancer
*  I didn't realize like because I know the owners I know Ed clay and Scotty Nelson
*  They're my they thought you had cancer because you were there and the only reason I went down there was for the stem cells
*  Right because in Mexico this is there it's in Tijuana
*  They can do anything so not only is Ed clay and Scotty Nelson like they just committed their lives to
*  putting all the best
*  Anti-cancer treatments together like the gerson therapy is one of many things
*  They do a bunch of alternative like people come down there with like third stage fourth stage or whatever they got and
*  This is like the last hurrah. So they hit him with the gerson therapy. They hit him with the NADH
*  Have you heard about this? Yes, and a DH they hit him with hyperbaric chambers every day
*  Electro magnetic fucking therapy. There's all this shit there. They got different things on IVs and
*  So I went down there and I didn't realize that people were gonna think I was like I had cancer
*  So is this really beneficial to people that have cancer like what exactly so many treatments
*  They you're saying they hit him with all the I'm assuming you hit him with like a pile of them all together
*  Yeah, they got a system down there man, and and they don't make any claims man. There's no claims
*  Well, you can't make you can't make claims but they got what what chipsa is all about is all the latest
*  Ed clays I met him when he was 19 and I was 30 and I knew I knew when I met Ed clay
*  I'm like dude, you're 19. You sound like you're 45. I'm like smart, dude
*  Dude, I'm like, what are you doing in this 19 year old body? I know one day you're gonna be a
*  Business tycoon of some sort you're gonna be huge and so he dedicated his life his story was he got addicted to
*  Pills he got addicted to Vicodin. He was a black belt BJJ black belt. That's how I know him through the martial arts world
*  He owned his own mixed martial arts gym, Nashville MMA
*  He and then he had a couple MMA fights and then he got a he got hurt had some surgery got addicted to pills and
*  He had a real bad addiction and it was fucking him up and then he heard about ibogaine and I will gain is like
*  the African version of ayahuasca and
*  Supposedly, I don't know that much about it
*  But supposedly you go through an ibogaine trip and it resets your brain in some way
*  I don't know that you don't you could quit those pills without going through all the withdrawals in the pain
*  You just got to go through it for 36 hours or something like that
*  You do ibogaine and he found out about this and he went down to Mexico and did it and it cured him of his
*  Fucking pill addiction like he really worked. So at first he was he sold his MMA gym
*  He goes I'm gonna put and he was like a real estate mogul to super smart guy
*  He was all in the real estate and everything. He has he had he was well-off sold his MMA
*  He was growing beyond an MMA gym
*  Really? He was just growing beyond that and then he decided to open up an ibogaine
*  Hospital in Mexico to help as many people as he could to get over their pill addictions
*  he was like I'm just gonna just dedicate my life to saving people and then a
*  Lot of stuff happened. It's a long story, but he ended up going, you know what? Let's save people. Let's save people
*  Let's try to help people with cancer. So it all led to that. Like the what's the everyone's worst fears getting cancer
*  I didn't know he was doing that until I talked to you because we've talked about him many times in the podcast that whole
*  Ibogaine retreat and then I think that people are having an issue with various addictions
*  There's a lot of a lot of a lot of weird problems with going straight
*  He just went from let's save people from pill addiction to let's save people from cancer
*  So him and Scotty Nelson who used to own on the mat OTM they got together and they put all their money together and
*  You know bought this hospital and do you want to call so crazy?
*  They bought a dude I'm there all week and we're sitting in the car he's running everything like El Patrón
*  Do you know how crazy that is? Yeah owns a hospital?
*  He owns a hospital and he's all about he's got like scientists all around him and they're all about
*  Finding the best shit. They're just let me ask you this
*  What can they do in comparison to like what they can do in Panama? Could they do the same kind of shit?
*  It's the exact same weird. No, that's the same thing
*  That rear it in one of his partners is one of the guys that went to Chipsa
*  So that's why they're doing stem they're doing the same thing
*  But they even admit the dude in Panama is like the godfather of everything
*  But the way they're doing it at Chipsa and like Chipsa is like it's a it's a cancer alternative hospital
*  But the only reason you know, they're using stem cells too for some treatments
*  So you don't have to have cancer to go there. I get people sending me shit like dude heal up, bro
*  I'm with you and I'm like dude, I don't have cancer and then I shaved my head
*  Oh, dude, I went to chips on then I shaved my head. Everyone thinks I'm dying
*  So I'm not dying guys
*  I just I went to Chipsa to get stem cells because my body is broken as fuck
*  I'm 50 years old and my knee my shoulder my back they're fucked up and I was getting to the point
*  I started roll. I was rolling this whole year, you know roll with little guys little blue belts little purple belts
*  Then I started working up with the bigger guys and I was like fuck it
*  Let's just see what happens boom and then my shoulder gets fucked up again and I'm like, you know what?
*  Yeah, I got fucked up again
*  And then I then I and at that point Ed clay was Ed clint and Scott
*  He was saying dude come down to the hospital will get you on these stem cells will do you're gonna we're gonna repair all that shit
*  Come on, man. Come on down. Come on down. And I'm like, I don't know if that's gonna work
*  I don't know. I don't know if you get an MRI on your shoulder. Yeah shoulder surgery. Yes, and then you heard it again
*  Yeah, but I didn't get an MRI. No, I just felt like I strained it
*  I'm like is it did I strain it or did I fuck it that fuck the surgery up?
*  That was the question how many months after the surgery were you rolling?
*  About a year. I waited a year. That's not them. Yeah waited about a year. That's not unreasonable
*  Okay, no, maybe six months. I'm sorry. Not a thought about it. I go
*  I think they told me a year, but I waited six months. I was going little people but it's no big deal
*  so I so
*  Ed was always telling me to come down and I just kept like putting it off and then finally after I re-injured my shoulder
*  I'm like, you know what? What the fuck am I doing? Dude? I gotta get it. I gotta do these stems
*  I gotta do them the best thing that it's out there and if it doesn't work, you know what at least I tried
*  I'm do I gotta do the best shit. So I called up and I go
*  Let's set it up. So we found a week where we could both we did it together me and Eddie goes
*  We're gonna do this shit everything to get everything we did. He was right there with me and did it with me
*  Beautiful he's one of the greatest guys I've ever met in my life. Well, I hope it works, you know, it'd be I just gotta wait
*  I gotta wait a couple
*  I will tell you this that I didn't start the stems until the third day and the first couple days
*  we were doing NADH we're doing all this stuff and
*  Immediately my inflammation and my knees was gone immediately like from all the stuff
*  We were doing the ozone therapy the hyperbaric chamber. We were doing this electron all day
*  I was there like eight hours doing so you say every day your inflammation like your knees
*  Like what they feel like before oh my knees are fucked up my my good knee
*  Not the sir. My surgery knee is not my good rubber guard knee my surgery knee. Thank God
*  It's not my rubber guard knee, but it still hasn't healed it cut out so much meniscus. It's fucking sore and tender
*  It just won't heal. How bad was the tear before you got it fixed?
*  Dude, it locked on me about ten times before I got a surgery
*  So every time it locks it rips it up some more it was a mess
*  So they took out most of my meniscus and and so it still hasn't healed and then my good knee
*  Something happened and leg lock drills. I don't know something happened where I think I sprained it
*  So I'm like, okay, I gotta stop but then at the same time my shoulder got fucked up
*  So like all of a sudden all my whole body is fucked up. It's hard to get out of bed
*  And then I called Ed and I'm like dude, let's just do this. Let's see if let's let's go through it
*  Let's do this. So they injected my shoulder with
*  like
*  Apparently there's I don't know the the the technical term for these
*  stem cells, but they were
*  umbilical cord
*  Organic, I don't know. I just said just give me your best shit. They stuck my shoulder. They stuck my knee and
*  Then I put it in we got stem cells. This is what everybody says about IV. This is what everybody says about you
*  Yeah, you don't wait long enough
*  Everybody says you dive right back into rolling too quick and then you got to give yourself more rehab
*  Tell you that couple people who told you a few people talking they're worried that you you're addicted to rolling
*  Which everybody is right and like when you're coming back from an injury how much like weightlifting stuff did you do?
*  I was doing weightlifting to you and like physical physical therapist
*  They give you a fucking savages trying to take my head off. Oh, I understand
*  I don't know what I mean, but they're saying is that you went too hard. I did. Yeah now I know that
*  I wanted to test myself. So now this is the plan the plan is I'm gonna wait a couple because the stem cells it takes
*  Supposedly they take because I took them through IV too. We did them double
*  We shot them with a fucking million fucking gazillion and then put them in IV
*  But I did the whole fucking thing hyperbaric chamber every day watching Fight Club on
*  DVD all that shit dude every day dude all day. I was doing the shit. I go I have to go through this
*  I'm getting all this is my I got a hundred and fifteen schools that depend on me. I got to do this shit
*  So now I'm just waiting it's been less than a month since I did it
*  Supposedly you're not supposed to it takes a while for stem cells to regrow shit
*  Two to three months or something like that
*  So I'm gonna do shit for two or three months because if I start rolling now
*  Well, you know John Donahurt doesn't roll right? Yeah, he heard his hip or something. He's that hip replacement
*  He's gonna have a knee replacement his body's all fucked. We're all headed there. Yeah, we're all we're all gonna end up
*  Being there. Yeah, you can't roll forever. No, you know, I heard Hickson's rolling again
*  That's what I heard, you know, it's told me that you know what it is
*  It's like um can't leave it alone if it just feels so good
*  Like I appreciate it so much now is the weird thing is the weird thing is I when I started rolling again this year
*  More than ever while I roll more than ever anytime. I pull off a little sweep or a little cool transition
*  although we say
*  I
*  Enjoy it loud. Yeah, I'm constantly boy
*  so
*  Because I appreciate like the little move
*  If I butterfly sweep a motherfucking and I pass his guard at the same time you I'm gonna say yes
*  Yeah for sure. I'm like I'm like I appreciate every little transition and then I remember every little transition
*  I'm like I gotta teach this I gotta teach that. Oh, I forgot about that. There's just so much
*  It's so endless that unless you're rolling you'll forget that's what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of stop like stop rolling and then I
*  Forget certain transitions because there's so much the best thing you could do the best thing now. I know on my deathbed
*  Record as many of your roles as fucking possible
*  Record your roles watch them watch your decision-making watch your mistakes, man
*  And then you remember shit you got to record as many roles as possible that's that's all I'm gonna so it's like comedy
*  Yes
*  exact dude
*  The only reason I record every one of my sets is because of you
*  That's the only reason because you always say you gotta record your sets
*  You gotta record your sets
*  So my rituals is on my way to my my next set is I'm listening to the last set on the driveover
*  You know what I mean? And there's so many times I'll go back to listen old sets
*  Like there's some shit that I don't even remember saying and I would have never remembered it. Yeah, you know what I mean?
*  There's so much shit. You're like damn. There's too much to remember
*  No, man, the ride home the ride home you have to treat as part of the job
*  This is what I've listened to her the right home. I never done that. This is my afraid to know
*  This is my new thing. My new gimmick is the ride home. I listen to recordings
*  Maybe take another hit depending on whether or not I want to go deep and then bust out the laptop
*  So the ride home, I'm listening and then when I get home, I write I'm gonna stand up frame of mind
*  Everybody's asleep. Everybody's asleep. So the whole world asleep. So it's like one o'clock in the morning
*  It's just me just sitting there with a dog just chilling. Damn. It's typing
*  Yeah, and if I do that every day and I said this is my job
*  My job is not just to show the comedy store and do my set
*  My job is to listen to a set on the way there and then listen to that set on the way home and then sit in
*  My laptop for an hour to hour and a half and I feel like if I do
*  It's not that hard man coal mining is hard. Yeah, you know sand mining that shit's hard
*  Yeah, I gotta do that. What I do is know what the problem is
*  Nobody has always your boss. Yeah, nobody tells you what to do
*  If you just worked at a warehouse they hit Eddie just do whatever you can with all these packages
*  Versus if you work for Amazon, they give you a fucking time clock and trick ready go and stopwatch is ticking down
*  How many minutes you have left to send this package out?
*  You're running because you don't want to get reprimanded
*  You know I was telling you about my ritual right my rituals if I as I'm driving to
*  My next set or getting ready for my next set. I listen to my old side
*  Yes, and I have it fresh in my head and I go on stage, right?
*  So what happens is I have a few good sets in a row. Nothing goes bad
*  It seems to go good. Some people seem to like it and then I get fucking lazy
*  I get lazy and there was one time where I was gonna do that
*  Bruce buffer show at the laugh factor. We're gonna do a show at the laugh first time. I'm ever there
*  So I thought okay, I'm gonna drive there and listen to my last recording like I usually do but then I didn't want to
*  I go I want to take an uber and drink, you know
*  I got late. I got too cocky dude. So then I thought no, no, no, I gotta I gotta be strict
*  I got it. No, you know, I can't call an uber
*  I'm gonna drive my truck and listen to my goddamn set again, but then I thought oh my god
*  maybe I'll just put earplugs in and get in the uber and just
*  Listen to listen to with my earbuds and I'm like cool
*  That's what that's what I'll do
*  So I called the uber and I usually don't drink at home before I before I go to the comedy store because I'm driving
*  So I thought I'm ubering it so I have one drink
*  So now I'm one drink in in my rituals one drink at the Comedy Store, right?
*  So I I get in the uber and immediately when I get in the uber the guy goes first time ever only time ever
*  Guy goes dude. Are you Eddie Bravo? You're I love JRE. I listen to you on the podcast all time
*  So he just wanted to talk about JRE. So I never listened to the set so we get to the laugh
*  I'm like I didn't listen to the set. I talked to this guy. He was cool. He was a fucking cool-ass guy
*  You know what? I'm not gonna listen to shit. I'll be fine, right? So I get there and then built Bruce buffers
*  I got shots of stick shots to kill us everyone and I'm like, I'm not I'm like drinking way too much
*  Don't have my set fresh in my head and I went on stage and fucking it wasn't a total disaster
*  Man I had my family there and everything for the first time. I'm like, it was not a good set
*  It was a bad set and I'm like fuck but I learned from that you learn from them losses
*  I'm like don't ever get lazy
*  Because when you have that set fresh in your mind and then you go on stage it ain't that hard you just heard that
*  Motherfucker, you know what I mean? Well, it's not just that for me. It's writing things down like two cards are big
*  I use index cards down with sharpies before my sense
*  My rider. Okay, I do a show I'll write just bullet points just titles of bits shit like that
*  Yeah, and then another thing that works is like during the day of a show
*  I'll sit in front of the computer and just rewrite bits. Yeah, just write them out write them out
*  It's like it's not necessary. Yeah, and you can get away without doing it. But I always feel like the more I
*  Do more I do the better more prepared you are for sure
*  Yeah, it's just like when I would do the opening monologues for like EBI countdown shows. I used to do that
*  I don't do it anymore always always you write it all out. Yeah, the first three takes ain't that good
*  You don't remember but by the fourth and fifth take you got you can see it and yeah
*  There's a teleprompter in front of the you've done it so much and then now you could really nail it
*  It's like it's the same thing just as you just give a certain. Yes a certain pass that you just nail
*  You gotta do over and over but you know those grooves that you catch in when you are in in that path that you've been
*  Through a thousand times. Yeah, just like comedy. Yeah, just like everything else
*  Just like a monologue just like acting in a movie if it wasn't for jujitsu
*  I wouldn't be doing comedy man jujitsu train me
*  Well jujitsu taught you also how to teach so you talk to people like you have this way of projecting public speaking experience is huge
*  I I got a couple
*  Instructors that are looking to do and looking to do comedy
*  Yeah, cuz if you could if you could teach a seminar you can teach a three-hour seminar
*  You have the tools to be a stand-up comedian. Now you got to be funny
*  Well, listen, this is the thing about stand-up comedians only 30% of them ever even try it
*  Yeah, it's probably 70% of the potential legitimate stand-up comedians in the country
*  Yeah, don't ever do it. Yeah, you know this people that do it and they're delusional and they do it
*  They did they don't see reality correctly
*  So they'll never really be good. There's there's people like that
*  Yeah, but then there's people that just decide to keep working at the you know, the car and they're funny as funny as fuck
*  Yeah, I told I know I've told you about this guy. But when I was an amateur comedian when I was driving
*  For private investigator, I met this private investigator
*  He had a like it was like be a private investigators assistant. I was like, oh cool really was just he became a very good friend of mine
*  He lost his license drinking and driving. So he needed someone to drive him around. So that was a private investigators assistant
*  I was just his driver
*  But his name was Dave Dolan. I
*  loved him to the day he died, but he
*  He needed someone to drive him to places and he also was it turns out just randomly
*  He was a cousin to one of the people who owned the Comedy Connection in Boston Bill Downs
*  He's Bill Downs cousin. So I met him and I was like what you're Bill's cousin. He's like guys my fucking cousin
*  He was the funny one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life and at the time for sure
*  The funniest guy I had ever met and I was like, how is this guy not a comedian?
*  This doesn't even make sense, dude
*  We would go places and we would have to like get up at four o'clock in the morning
*  I would pick him up and then we drive to like some location
*  we have to park on the corner to see if some guy who's
*  Pretending to be injured is going to work under the table in another way
*  Like we have to take pictures of him and shit that kind of stuff was mostly insurance scams
*  So I'd be sitting on the side of the road with this guy and he would be just talking shit
*  Just talking shit about life and about girls and about fucking everything from top to bottom
*  He was doing a mob. He was doing a one-man show for me and I'm a professional
*  You know not really at the time I was an amateur and I don't think I'd ever even gotten paid
*  But I was an aspiring comedian and I'm sitting here with this guy in a car
*  I'm like, this is the funniest fucking dude I've ever talked to in my life. I'm nothing compared to him
*  He's so much funnier than me. He never wanted to do comedy even while my comedy was taking off
*  He never wanted to do comedy. I'm like Dave you could do comedy. He's like fuck that. I bust scumbags
*  All he wanted it was just a private investigator busting scumbags
*  And now like I don't know if it's the economy or what but it's it's like this in jujitsu
*  Comedy and jujitsu have one thing in common. It seems like
*  Economically, it's bigger than it's ever been because back like 10 15 years ago
*  I remember thinking to myself like damn there ain't that many motherfuckers out there
*  They could they could teach seminars and make some big money. I was like fuck there ain't that many it's and now shit
*  seminars in jujitsu are
*  Every every boring it's insane. It's like touring everybody
*  Exactly comedians everybody's touring everyone's got their specials. Yes, dude
*  It's amazing economy is insane. It wasn't like this 10 years ago because I remember like not even 10 years ago
*  My business manager said
*  You gotta slow down with your money because you're running out of money
*  Ten like ten eight years ago. It was like it wasn't always good. But right now
*  Man everybody in my association it seemed like I would say 90%
*  Everybody's growing constantly growing growing growing the word has gotten out about the benefits of jujitsu
*  There's so many people that have Instagram pages and yeah, so many people make videos
*  And the economy the economy is booming. Yeah podcasts
*  Yeah, people talk about jujitsu a lot you get to see way more videos of jujitsu if on Instagram or YouTube or whatever
*  I mean, it's a good time for gra and also like there's so many
*  Dominant players in grappling today from Craig Jones, you know, it's a different world
*  You know and Eddie Tone is now
*  Gary Tone in and Eddie Cummins, you know
*  Eddie's now running his own school and Gary's fighting in MMA and it's like this these some of these like super high-level
*  High-profile guys now have like large social media followings. Yeah, you know like Gary Tone and it's like he's a funny Twitter follow
*  He says funny shit like he's a smart dude and he's doing really well in MMA and you're like, hey that guy's got
*  Nasty nasty grappling. Yeah, like do you see that flying scissor hook? He hit Nabu Dabi? Yeah
*  Flying flying heel hook. Yeah scissor takedown. Yeah, he's a legit world-class
*  Submission artist that's now fighting in MMA look what's happening in Abu Dhabi
*  I get all the the rising stars the hottest stars are all no-gigas on Craig Jones Lachlan Giles
*  John blank Gio Martinez Gordon Ryan
*  Gary Tone in all of them all no-gigas. They're not doing anything in the game. They're not competing in the game
*  They're no-gigas. So you're starting to see right now that it's getting the sport is getting so technical
*  And so specialized that if you want to be the best in the key
*  You got to spend all your time in the key you want to be the best no-gigas
*  You got to spend all your time no-gigas. It's hard to do both doing both man
*  It's tough like Gordon Ryan's not trying to compete in the key because he knows he realizes like damn that's gonna that's another lifetime
*  You know, I think that we there's there's gotta be some way
*  Where we can wake people up to how fun that shit is to watch?
*  You know, I mean combat jujitsu goes a long way your concept because people get to see people get bitch slaps
*  People love people getting bitch slapped, but I think that uh, I think some they're they're missing something
*  Well the car no, no, I think I think we already have it. We have it. We have combat jujitsu
*  That's the best shit and then we also have quintet. Quintet is the best way to make
*  jujitsu a team sport
*  That quintet is awesome
*  But what I'm talking about is they're missing something that makes it mainstream all it all it is remember UFC
*  We all knew in the UFC when it was underground. We all knew that it was the greatest sport ever
*  We all knew that but the world didn't know that and and what what happened?
*  to awaken the world was the ultimate fighter with Forrest Griffin and
*  Stephen but Stefan Bonner, right? That's the one that blew everybody knows that that's part of history
*  You can put that in that UFC documentary that show blew up MMA blew up the UFC
*  and
*  It wasn't because like all of a sudden the UFC became more entertaining after that like they figured it out after it was always the same
*  Sport but over here. No one knew about it over here. Everybody knows about it and they love it
*  They're just needed some there just need to be something to expose the world to what already existed
*  Not like change what already existed right it was already perfect just people didn't know about it now people know about it
*  It's the same thing ultimate fighter Forrest Griffin. They blew it up. So when it comes to grappling
*  I think it's gonna be someone we're gonna do combat jujitsu world's quintet style
*  We're gonna we're gonna do the doing doing both. Are you gonna do tag team? No that tag team shit is hilarious
*  Do you remember do you remember what you know what quintet is right? Yes
*  Quintet is five against five. Yes, right and very it's random who winds up it's amazing
*  It's a nice of weight classes. So what I'm gonna do is do combat jujitsu five against five. Oh, don't you?
*  Yeah, oh, the big guys are gonna smash the little people. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but we're gonna change it
*  It's gonna be five on five, but every it's gonna be the featherweights. Everyone's gonna be 145
*  Okay, everybody's gonna be the same way. We're not gonna do David and Goliath
*  Because all that ends up happening there is the small guy tries to survive to get the big guy out
*  Well, so that kind of fucks up the strategy, you know what I mean of pure jujitsu, but when everybody's the same weight
*  There's no reason to take anybody out
*  Every fight you want to beat the guy not just hold them because if I'm going against the guy that's 20 pounds heavier than me
*  The smart strategy would be just don't get tapped and hold on and get him out of there
*  Right that fucks up the sport was is quintet
*  Did they set it up with the five people have a total weight limit? Yes, so you there's all these mismatches but
*  It's a beautiful thing
*  But I'm gonna do a different a total weight limit like
*  Five people 850 pounds something like that 900 pounds
*  So you had to figure out what you're gonna choose like all one side like that pounders
*  It's pretty badass. But when it comes to combat jujitsu, they all gotta be this we're gonna just we're gonna do welter weights five on five
*  You know middle weights five on five but the same thing like if there's a draw here they both get DQ'd
*  It's gonna be the same concept. But at the end what's gonna be a little different too is
*  That a lot of times in in quintet you have like every match is a draw and they all you know
*  There it's a tie. They're all eliminated at the same time
*  So then at that point they go to whoever has the most penalty cards and if that's a tie
*  Then they go to a judge's decision and my version
*  We if it goes to a tie then we go each team picks the opposing teams
*  Ebi ot competitor and they decide an EBI ot which is basically a rear naked choke shootout. We do it a little different
*  We're keeping that EBI ot did it to you as a tiebreaker. That's it
*  Not in every match just at the very end of it to tie we go to EBI ot. I love it
*  It's a great idea crazy, yeah
*  I think grappling is probably just even watching grappling on YouTube. I mean as many times I look at videos
*  There's a million views many times
*  There's there's more people watching grappling and paying attention to high-level grappling on YouTube now
*  Then I think anytime that I could ever remember. Yeah, there's so many shows now like there's fight to win
*  What's Jail Sun and Swann?
*  submission underground
*  Then there's a
*  Kasai and then there's
*  Finishers, which they got a great one. They got a they got a quintet style finishers coming up ultimate mat warriors
*  Combat sports. Yeah, there's a whole shit load. You know what? I'm looking forward to as much as anything
*  What do you want a wilder Tyson Fury to oh shit? What is that? That's soon soon couple. That's February
*  Is that what it is? Jamie?
*  February 22nd and that's the one where Tyson got knocked down and he rose from the dead
*  Yeah, and he won or lost what he still was a draw. It was a draw
*  But most people feel like if you look at it objectively, there's two ways of looking at yeah
*  If you look at it objectively Tyson Fury out boxed him
*  He beat him ten rounds to two
*  But if you look at it in terms of like chaos and wildness and what counts more
*  Deontay Wilder floored him twice and one time literally we saw his soul
*  Pull out of his body then he grabbed his soul by the ankle and dragged it back in
*  Tyson Fury just rose like no one expected and fought his way out of a terrible situation and then
*  Dominated the rest of the round in my eyes Tyson Fury won the fight
*  But in my eyes, I'm fine with a draw because Deontay Wilder nuked him into orbit twice
*  You know, it was it was so chaos
*  I couldn't say who really won one. I want to watch that shit and I gave up on boxing
*  But I watched the heavyweight division now. It seems like it's awesome now. Deontay is from another planet, man
*  He's got Thanos his glove in his right hand. How about Francis and Gano against him?
*  Well, I mean Francis
*  I think Francis really legitimately could be a top-tier heavyweight because of his power and because of his speed
*  And because his knockout ability is insane if he really got into boxing the way he got into MMA
*  I think you really could be a top-flight boxer
*  But you wouldn't want him just jumping right in with Deontay Wilder Deontay Wilder is a bronze medalist in the Olympics
*  World-class boxer. I mean he has an insane record the most insane
*  You know, he has the most insane record in the history of the heavyweight division. I
*  Think if I'm right pull up Deontay Wilder. Oh dude, listen way more way crazier. It's literally
*  40 knockouts
*  One draw one decision
*  Wow, dude
*  Every fight to knockout. He's a fucking monster. That is the most he's a monster. He's a monster dude
*  He's a monster. No one hits like him. It doesn't make any sense
*  He hit that last dude Louis Ortiz in the forehead and his body went to like just shut down
*  He just bought he just catches guys these punches and everybody out among the show. He's a great guy
*  He was on the show. He's a great guy. You know what? He told me
*  He told me that when he fought Tyson for he weighed 209 pounds. What he was
*  I don't know why I was so light
*  That's just how how heavy I was like he doesn't try to put on weight because he knows he can nuke people and it's all
*  Stand up, right? So there's probably a benefit of being a 209 pound guy in boxing
*  Where there's no there's no leg kicks. It's speed and he has crazy power
*  Like his undeniable power
*  But no one could smother him and drag him to the ground do all kinds of shit that heavy people can do in a fight
*  MMA fight, right? Yeah, he in boxing. I think he might have an advantage. I think yet at
*  210 pounds that's probably
*  the max
*  Weight for power like anything extra is gonna slow down the power now. You're gonna slow down
*  I would agree with you is so you get to Francis
*  Francis hits so much harder than anyone. It's 205 pounds dude. He hits people so hard
*  Francis is a different animal because he hits like a really strong
*  60 pounds of muscle on top of that. I know what you're saying, but what I'm saying is
*  When once you start sacrificing speed maybe it's the speed because he's smaller the speed gets it through and he's got enough power
*  Maybe not the most power you could have but enough power to knock people out
*  But he still has the speed because he's smaller. Maybe that makes sense
*  I mean, it's it's a trade-off for sure, but I don't think Francis is slow at all
*  See when you have a big the thing about a Francis guy is like a thing about Connor and what does he walk at?
*  Francis is giant man. He walks into more than 260
*  Okay, more than 260 walking around and moves very fast
*  But those guys that have a lot of like Connor fast twitch muscle fiber like for us
*  I'll be talked about on the podcast. He was like those guys they're sprinters
*  They're just jumping and leaping and it's all these and and Daniel Cormier always talks about him as big actions these big actions
*  They're doing they require a lot of energy and those guys are rarely the guys who have like the most stamina
*  But they're the guys who are definitely the most dangerous for short amounts of time
*  And if you saw in the steep a fight steep a weathered to storm with Francis and then grabbed a hold of them and managed to wear
*  them out start dragging them to the ground and beat him up on the ground that
*  fight
*  Showed you what the problems are with that like fucking sprinting style
*  Like you you got to fight every fight like you know, this guy can definitely make it to the fifth round
*  Yeah, you got to fight every fight. You're not looking for the knockout, but if it's there, it's awesome
*  Yeah
*  And if you don't you never gonna beat the other for the worst and the elite of the elite is steep a silly
*  Steep a is the elite of the elite. He's the guy who's he's regained the heavyweight title
*  He's defended it more than anybody ever ever ever. He's that he's got the record
*  Steep a me out just has defended the UFC heavyweight title more than anyone. How many times I believe it's four
*  I believe you had four successful title defenses. That's crazy. Yes, and then
*  Loses Daniel Cormier and then comes a Mac and knocks out Daniel Cormier to retain the title
*  So I mean he's a Muhammad Ali type epic. He's epic steep a is epic
*  He doesn't get nearly enough love for what he's done like for martial arts
*  Like it's just he's not as flashy as some guys. He doesn't talk a lot of shit
*  He just puts his nose to the grindstone and gets his work done
*  But if you look at his accomplishments knocked out Alistair Overeem knocked out Junio dos Santos
*  I mean, he's a fucking monster man. He's a monster, you know
*  Knocks out Daniel Cormier to regain his title. He's a fucking animal and the only guy I mean
*  Derek Lewis beat Francis and Ghana, but it was a crazy fight where really nothing happened. It was a weird fight, but
*  Steep is the first guy to beat him steep a beat him, you know, he got a hold of Francis and he actually beat him
*  He's the only guy everybody else just running from those hammers son those hammers coming at you
*  Are you are you a steep a fan because he's from Cleveland?
*  Does that have any bearing? Oh, really? Okay, man, Cleveland people probably don't like Columbus people when they're all in, Ohio together
*  What's that when it was there outside? No, no, then then they become like, okay, we got a Ohio
*  Ohio Michigan out Ohio Ohio more more Browns fans in Columbus than Bengals fans, right more bangles. It's very close 50-50. Yeah
*  Okay, Ohio's an awesome spot man, it's a fun spot to go to too
*  It's like a fun spot to do stand-up at I'm trying to book some gigs out there. We can try to do a seminar
*  Seminar and show I'm weekend
*  I try to do a show on Friday night seminar Saturday morning and then get the fuck out
*  But sometimes when I'll do a show Saturday night, too, it's hard to do a seminar. It's sometimes I can't do it both
*  What's the most time you've ever done on stage?
*  40 minutes
*  That a lot so good man, it's close to headliner, you know
*  Like it used to be that a headliner had to do 45 it used to be there was 15 minutes for the opener
*  35 minutes for or 30 minutes rather for the middle act and then 45 minutes for the closer that was always I don't formula
*  I like just being that dude opening up no pressure if I fuck up you're gonna have a killer neck. So relax
*  I like no pressure. I like just being I like hiding behind Sam Tripley. I love that shit
*  I'm like you got a you got a killer about to go on. So if I don't do so well
*  The same simply he Sam Chippewa is the tip of the spear when it comes to stand up, that's what I was calm
*  I'm like, that's the front line. That's the guy we send in
*  You know Sam will go hard. Yeah, Sam Tripley will go hard the paint
*  you know the one thing I I think about the comedy store and back when we used to hang out there in
*  2001 and all the people that were there like Ari and Sam Tripley and Duncan all those dudes back then like
*  Sebastian and Eddie Griffin all all those dudes like they blew the fuck up
*  But not everybody not Sam not Steve Simone
*  There's a couple other guys, but some dude just got fucking big. Everyone's fucking rich now. It's crazy
*  and my my philosophy is not philosophy, but what I take from
*  Comedy is you for sure?
*  You're gonna give your best performance when you have like a packed house and they all love you
*  You're gonna give a good performance, right?
*  Cuz you feel all that energy and it gives it back to you as opposed to like doing stand-up in front of like six people
*  And they don't know who you are
*  That's probably not gonna be your best set
*  Maybe most of the time and they're gonna be your best set it ain't gonna compare to a whole
*  fucking room filled with people that love you and then all that energy makes you
*  Give your best performance like ever right and Sam never really got back. So Sam was always like, hey, yeah
*  He's a good comic, you know, but ever no one really like no one was saying like oh, he's amazing
*  They were saying he's good. He's good because he was they only saw him
*  Without fame in front of audiences like in the OR where no one really knew him
*  And so those are fucking hard crowds, dude
*  That's a hard room dude, but now now when we're doing tinfoil hat people are showing up for him, dude
*  They love him
*  So now you're seeing Sam in front of 200 people 250 people that love him or scream for him and he's
*  You're seeing the best of him because now he's got a crowd that's screaming for him and he comes out dude
*  I'm telling you telling you he crushes on the road when we go on the road and do a tinfoil hat
*  Sam destroys. I'm sure dude. I've known Sam forever. It's crazy. He's a funny guy. I'm glad it's all happening
*  so the thing with comedy is like you never really get to see what a comic really is about until
*  He performs in front of a and it's like a catch-22 because you ain't gonna have a pack room that knows you unless you
*  Acquired some kind of fame somehow through a TV show or through something through the internet
*  But man now you're starting to see right now. You're starting to see the real Sam like you're starting to see him peeking and shit
*  It's it's awesome. Every time we go out to him like dude fucking crushing. He's out there just smashing beautiful
*  Yeah, shout out to sham
*  Not only that dude seriously Sam is the one of the fucking coolest guys
*  I'm beautiful. You know I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say that that guy's a beautiful person doing this show on Tuesday the
*  Armenian assassin. Oh shit Eddie Bravo. This is fun, man. Thank you, man
*  Can I give a couple plugs? Yeah, I got a couple of plug
*  January 24th Dallas Fort Worth
*  Hyenas tinfoil hat me and Sam and then the next day January 25th in Oklahoma City at Bricktown
*  Comedy Club hope to see you there. Thank you very much. Love of love everybody. Oh and stay tuned
*  We're gonna be announcing a big 420 show in
*  Vancouver oh shit gonna be announced this week. We're very excited. That's it. Bye everybody
*  420 what's going on?
