# Joe Rogan Experience #1916 - Jon Bernthal
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5.72s)]
*  I grew up in D.C. and I think about the people who are my teachers and my parents, my friends' [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=10.92s)]
*  parents and they're sort of at the forefront of troops coming home and getting spit on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=18.44s)]
*  and you got people, you're coming out of Jim Crow and people going down south and getting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=25.84s)]
*  lynched in Meridian, Mississippi. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=34.76s)]
*  And then these assassinations, I just can't imagine what that must, like a string of assassinations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And just given the conversation, if you're talking about the most fucked up time when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=44.56s)]
*  you think everything is going to complete shit and it's just Harry Carrey. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=50.04s)]
*  I mean, imagine if right now, in the string of next week, Kanye was assassinated, Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=55.88s)]
*  was assassinated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=62.36s)]
*  I guess you had the thing at Pelosi's house, I guess that's kind of weird, but it's also [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=63.36s)]
*  kind of like... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=67.92s)]
*  That's just weird. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=68.92s)]
*  It's just weird, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=69.92s)]
*  But imagine that, imagine what we'd all be saying. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=70.92s)]
*  I think in the last couple of years, we really saw how close, how fragile this whole thing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=75.36s)]
*  is and how close this thing can go to just breaking down and you're kind of on your own. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=80.36s)]
*  But I just... [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=86.04s)]
*  To have both... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=87.04s)]
*  Yeah, you got a good point. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=88.04s)]
*  Like what did that feel like? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=91.04s)]
*  John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, all these murders, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=92.04s)]
*  all these assassinations, very close to each other. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=97.76s)]
*  You're talking about what, like 68s? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=100.48s)]
*  And then also you have, I mean, not to the same extent, I don't know how it would have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=102.16s)]
*  now, but you had Altamont, you had... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=107.04s)]
*  And then again, just scores of... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=110.12s)]
*  You had troops coming home. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=113.04s)]
*  Think about how we regard our military now and the reverence and respect that we treat [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  our military. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=121.04s)]
*  And think about these troops coming home, getting spit on, people throwing red paint [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=122.84s)]
*  at them in the airports. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=131.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=132.08s)]
*  What that says about us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=133.08s)]
*  Even if they had social media back then. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  And then all the other people that died during that time, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  All the rock stars, like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, everyone's dying. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=144.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  And then the 70s come along and you have fucking Watergate and Nixon's gone and all the chaos [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  And everybody's just manically horrified. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  You have the previous generation just absolutely fixated on this new war on drugs and what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=163.68s)]
*  that means. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  And then you have these great... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, who would be the equivalent of Hendrix, Morrison, and Janis Joplin now if they all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  died? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, we've got people getting shot in the street. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  We've got... [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=185.56s)]
*  What was his name from Migos? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=189.12s)]
*  He just died. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Offset just died. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, not Offset. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=192.68s)]
*  The other guy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=193.68s)]
*  Offset's still alive. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=194.68s)]
*  He's the one who's married to Cardi B. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=197.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=198.72s)]
*  It's... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=199.72s)]
*  The other guy got accidentally shot by one of his friends. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=200.72s)]
*  They were in the middle of some gunfight and one of his guys accidentally shot him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=205.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=212.08s)]
*  There's just... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=213.08s)]
*  We're so aware of the violence now, gun violence in South Central and gun violence in South [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=215.0s)]
*  Side of Chicago and gun violence in Baltimore. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=221.56s)]
*  I think we're probably more acutely aware of the... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=225.32s)]
*  Just because of the news cycle, just because of social media. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  In terms of the turmoil, and also you go from the tone of the 50s to the 60s, you have a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=232.6s)]
*  completely different style of culture is emerging. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=238.6s)]
*  The psychedelic style of culture and the music is different. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=242.88s)]
*  You got Woodstock and it seems like there's this... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=245.88s)]
*  Harris Thompson wrote about it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=250.52s)]
*  What happened after all that happened was you could just see this wave of change and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=252.6s)]
*  then it pulled back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=257.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=258.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=259.88s)]
*  Got a little bit too much for everybody. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=260.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=262.4s)]
*  I mean, is it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=263.4s)]
*  But it's all these monumental shifts and then everything tries to balance itself out and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=265.64s)]
*  then you have these new dilemmas and new problems. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=271.44s)]
*  I would imagine it is. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=273.64s)]
*  I have a friend named Tony Maggio, who's a legendary drug cop in Baltimore from the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=276.2s)]
*  East Side. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=284.64s)]
*  He's from the community. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  He's got the complete and utter respect of everyone in that department, not just on the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=287.84s)]
*  East Side, but city-wide in Baltimore. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=292.8s)]
*  And also he's got the respect of people on the street. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=294.92s)]
*  He talks about now, just talking about these soldiers coming home in the Vietnam era and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=296.84s)]
*  what that was like. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=302.8s)]
*  I really equate that to everything that law enforcement's going through right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  We have these... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=309.16s)]
*  For the first time with Vietnam, you had these images. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=310.16s)]
*  Look, I wasn't alive, but from what I hear, you had these images coming into people's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=312.04s)]
*  living rooms of these horrible situations, people talking about the My Lai Massacre, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=315.6s)]
*  people talking about these things in Vietnam. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=321.64s)]
*  And to the same extent now, we were just sort of... [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=325.8s)]
*  There's so many examples of crazy and rampant police brutality. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=330.32s)]
*  You have these instances that were then magnified to the point where people who have no experience [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=334.68s)]
*  in this world would think that this is what all police are doing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden you have this unbelievably strident anti-police movement in this country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=342.88s)]
*  And the result of it, in a lot of places, is a total increase in crime. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=351.36s)]
*  And talking to Tony about it, he really believes that it's just a pendulum. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=357.68s)]
*  It's just a pendulum. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=364.76s)]
*  You go one way, then you go the other. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=366.12s)]
*  And he thinks it's going to really swing back. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=369.12s)]
*  Well, I hope he's right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=371.32s)]
*  It seems like that's always the case, as long as there's not some sort of a catastrophic [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  thing that happens, like a world war, something that literally flattens society and civilization. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=378.88s)]
*  I mean, generally people try to move things in a better direction. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  It's just setbacks and all these things that happen along the way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  I think culturally, we're all trying to move towards a better direction. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=395.68s)]
*  That's why there is so much outrage. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  When you have this anti-police sentiment, it is because of all these horrible egregious [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  examples of police brutality that we see. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=407.26000000000005s)]
*  The right way to do it is not defund the police. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  The right way to do it is not this attitude towards all law enforcement, which is crazy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=412.72s)]
*  Because some of those same people, they're going to find themselves in a situation where [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=419.16s)]
*  they need law enforcement. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=422.32000000000005s)]
*  And then what do they do? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=424.32000000000005s)]
*  They look like hypocrites. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  It's a lack of understanding of the scope of the overall problem. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=428.12s)]
*  And I think a lot of the times, the conversation is just really being led by the wrong people. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=432.88000000000005s)]
*  We're looking at pundits and celebrities and so-called experts in these situations. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=436.72s)]
*  We're not talking to the people that are actually on the ground doing the job, people from the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=441.32s)]
*  communities. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=445.88s)]
*  And I think there's a lot to be learned from those folks. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=448.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=450.48s)]
*  Oh, no doubt. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=451.48s)]
*  It seems like there's also this problem of there's so much information to sort through. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=453.4s)]
*  When you're dealing with this 24-hour news cycle and social media, you're dealing with [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  most of the things that people concentrate on are negative. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=462.92s)]
*  And so you're dealing with negative consequences and negative actions from billions of people [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  and we're all trying to filter it out and apply it to our everyday lives while everyone's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=471.28s)]
*  freaking out about climate change, while everyone's freaking out about the war in Ukraine, while [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  everyone's freaking about the drug problem and the border problem, the cartels and fentanyl [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=480.64s)]
*  and shit. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=486.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=487.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=488.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=489.84s)]
*  And everything's designed to just sort of be delivered in the most unnuanced, the most [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=490.84s)]
*  just sort of bright lights. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  Hey, pay attention to me. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's scary. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=499.32s)]
*  The truth gets really lost and these issues are enormously complicated and they're not [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=502.04s)]
*  easy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=508.76s)]
*  And trying to say that they are or trying to just sort of deliver an agenda or say I'm [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=509.76s)]
*  on this team or this team, I'm on this side or the other side. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  For me, I find that enormously un-American and I find it, I think it's a huge mistake [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=519.12s)]
*  and it's not the way I want to live my life or it's not the way I want my kids to live theirs. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=525.28s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=529.52s)]
*  Yeah, I feel exactly the same way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=530.52s)]
*  We have a horrible tendency towards tribalism in this country. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  There's definitely this trend. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=537.28s)]
*  I think that's also exacerbated by social media and the algorithms where people are [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=540.12s)]
*  just, they're holding up on teams and attacking people on the other side and all of it is [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  kind of fucked. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=549.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=550.68s)]
*  And isolating even more and more. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=551.68s)]
*  And I think that, I really think that the lines in which we're dividing ourselves, so [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=552.8s)]
*  many people have talked about the polarization. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=559.92s)]
*  It's like one of these things. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  It's like everybody talks about it but we still kind of, still march to the beat of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  that drummer and I think that the lines that divide us, they're so porous, they're so insignificant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=570.28s)]
*  There's no value based on those lines ever in my opinion. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  I think we miss out on so much by holding people back or saying you are on this side [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=582.52s)]
*  or you're on that side and I look at it in terms of the way we, our prejudices and these [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=592.4s)]
*  things that we ascribe to, I look at it in that movement that we were talking about to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=605.16s)]
*  sort of jump to this conclusion. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=611.8s)]
*  If you've never been in a situation where you've really needed the police to say that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=613.24s)]
*  all cops are bastards or abolish the police or to say that folks in these communities [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=618.2s)]
*  where the violence is going down in sort of the most violent cities in America, to think [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=628.16s)]
*  that those folks that are from those communities don't want more policing there is just a huge [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=636.76s)]
*  mistake and I really feel like when I talk to my friends in Shreveport, Louisiana or [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=641.16s)]
*  in Baltimore, that is not the case. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  I look at it a lot of times if you had a football team and you felt that, you know what, I just [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=650.36s)]
*  don't want any homosexuals on my football team. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=664.48s)]
*  If you're just like, if that's how you felt, there could be somebody on that, you could [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=668.76s)]
*  have somebody on your team who's six foot five, you know, runs a four-four-forty and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  just can demolish people but because of your own stupid prejudice, because of your own [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=678.4s)]
*  just ridiculousness that you ascribe to, you're missing out and your team's got to fail and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=683.44s)]
*  it's just such a, it's impossible to thrive. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=689.28s)]
*  It's impossible and I just find it so unbelievably un-American. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=693.28s)]
*  It's definitely un-American. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=697.92s)]
*  You have such an interesting nuanced perspective which, you know, I don't want to say is unusual [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  for actors because I think actors are just human beings and they vary widely but to be [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  a guy like yourself who decides, hey, I want to put these opinions out there and I want [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  to talk about things in this sort of nuanced and, you know, objective way, like what made [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=716.8399999999999s)]
*  you decide to do that because that's very unusual for actors. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=723.7199999999999s)]
*  It's also unusual for actors to do it well. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=727.56s)]
*  Like you don't come across as someone who's trying to sort of soften your words or say [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  things in a way that's virtuous so that people like you more. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=739.16s)]
*  You seem very genuine in what you do and to do that as like in a podcast form, the way [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=743.76s)]
*  you're doing it, it's almost like, it's like, did you get any people saying like, hey, maybe [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=750.4s)]
*  you shouldn't do this? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this could be a liability, John. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=757.12s)]
*  What are you doing, dude? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=759.44s)]
*  You're throwing it all away. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=760.44s)]
*  Why do you have all these opinions? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=761.44s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and be the punisher. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=762.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=764.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=765.44s)]
*  And honestly, man, you know, I have huge trepidation. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=766.44s)]
*  I have huge hesitation and I don't necessarily think it's for the reasons that you just pointed [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=769.72s)]
*  out. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=775.64s)]
*  I think, you know, for me, you know, not to be grandiose about it but look, I love acting. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=776.64s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=784.72s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways, it genuinely saved my life. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think that I imagine, I'm a huge fan of yours and I listen to your show religiously [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=789.0s)]
*  and I imagine that's similar potentially to how you feel about comedy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=795.24s)]
*  I feel about acting. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=800.36s)]
*  I feel like it's a lifelong pursuit. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=801.36s)]
*  I feel like it's something that failure and humiliation is always on my shoulder. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=802.84s)]
*  He's always there talking to me and whispering to me and it's always a fight that I like [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  fighting. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=813.88s)]
*  You're never going to have it licked. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=815.52s)]
*  You always got to get better. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=817.04s)]
*  There's always further you can take it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=818.32s)]
*  There's always a grind to it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=820.72s)]
*  That's how I look at it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=822.64s)]
*  I love it and I'm beholden to it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=823.88s)]
*  So anything that kind of gets in the way of that is, I've been kind of conditioned to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=825.8s)]
*  think is the enemy. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=832.04s)]
*  And to be honest with you, one thing that I'm quite certain is the enemy of that is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=834.04s)]
*  putting more of myself out there. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=839.68s)]
*  I'm really not interested in being more well known. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=842.68s)]
*  So to be honest with you, there's a lot of trepidation about it in that way. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=851.0s)]
*  I think the more you hear from me, the more I share my views, just the more time in the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=855.16s)]
*  box you get of John being John, the less you're going to believe me as a tennis coach or as [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=861.56s)]
*  a mathematician or the punisher or whatever it is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  And so that is, but I will say, you know, the intentionality behind the show is something [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=870.48s)]
*  I genuinely believe in. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=877.76s)]
*  I think this all kind of came forward, you know, in COVID in sort of the wake of not [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  only George Floyd, but in just all these examples of this police brutality and this rampant [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=887.08s)]
*  police brutality and the fervor that kind of came after it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=894.84s)]
*  I was really in this situation where, like so many, I was so disgusted and heartbroken [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=898.84s)]
*  and angry watching that video and Eric Garner and I mean all of them, but George Floyd and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=907.8s)]
*  I really, really wanted to get out there and be part of that protest and be part of that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=915.56s)]
*  uprising. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=924.28s)]
*  But at the same time, I turned on the TV and I saw people throwing bottles at police officers. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought I saw people throwing bricks at police officers. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=931.36s)]
*  And to me, every single one of those police officers is a brother, a sister, a son, a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=934.4s)]
*  daughter, someone's best friend. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=939.64s)]
*  And I was disgusted by that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=943.92s)]
*  And I really, you know, I'm very grateful for kind of how I grew up and where I grew [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=947.28s)]
*  up. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=953.56s)]
*  In Washington, I have black folks in my family. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=954.8s)]
*  I grew up extraordinarily with familial and best friends and ties very much into the black [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=962.28s)]
*  community and I'm very much, I think, aware of the struggles that black folk have been [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=971.0s)]
*  in through the city and especially their struggles with police. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=978.28s)]
*  I myself have been beaten by the police, but I've also had my life saved by the police. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  And I also believe that so many of the folks that were sort of leading the charge in this [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=988.56s)]
*  anti-police movement and also so many folks that were leading the charge in this anti-black [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=995.76s)]
*  lives matter movement, there are folks who really had no experience, you know, really [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1001.56s)]
*  in it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1010.0799999999999s)]
*  And I saw people kind of like arguing from the polls, flag waving from the polls. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1011.88s)]
*  And I was seeing something kind of in America generally where strength and patriotism was [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1015.2800000000001s)]
*  being confused with being rigid or being steadfast in your views and completely unbending and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1025.64s)]
*  an unwillingness to sit down with somebody that thinks differently than you and to be [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  confident in yourself enough to say, hey, you're an American, I'm an American, and like [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1035.64s)]
*  I might learn something from you. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1041.2s)]
*  I don't have all the answers. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1042.5200000000002s)]
*  And I think at that time, the genesis of, you know, I mean, you know, why the podcast [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1044.92s)]
*  started is I looked at, okay, well, you know, on one side you've got, you know, in this [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1051.48s)]
*  anti-police movement, who is the most, you know, who's the archetype that everyone is [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1057.44s)]
*  sort of most afraid of in that? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1062.4s)]
*  To me, it's the plain clothes unit, aggressive, take the fight to the criminal police officer, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1065.68s)]
*  right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1071.8s)]
*  And then on the other side, who's the archetype? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1072.8s)]
*  Who are we all afraid of? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay, well, maybe it's the African American gang member. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1075.3200000000002s)]
*  And you know, to me, I looked at my life and one of the things I'm most grateful for is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1079.2s)]
*  I have really, really, really dear, genuine close friends who fit both of those bills. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1083.28s)]
*  And it's my assumption because they are actually in it, pitted against each other at times, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1090.08s)]
*  but they are on the same streets dealing with each other. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1098.1999999999998s)]
*  There's so many times that they have opportunities to see good in each other, to find things [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1100.72s)]
*  that they respect about each other. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1107.52s)]
*  I find when I spend time, when I go out and ride along and I spend time with plain clothes [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1109.24s)]
*  police units, they'll look at their own groups and they'll say who's really about it and [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1115.84s)]
*  who's not. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1119.96s)]
*  They find flaws within their own community. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1120.96s)]
*  With a lot of the guys who have been really successful in the criminal world, it's the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1123.32s)]
*  same. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  And they're able to reach across this sort of so-called aisle and they're able to say, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1127.8799999999999s)]
*  hey, there's something about that guy I really respect. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1132.56s)]
*  I really dig what he did. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1134.52s)]
*  I really dig what that person did. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1135.6399999999999s)]
*  And I found that they kind of appreciate the same things. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1138.04s)]
*  They'd laugh at the same things. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1141.24s)]
*  They're a lot closer than they are further apart. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1143.24s)]
*  And I just thought that these were really the people that I want to listen to. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1146.16s)]
*  I want to listen to the people who are actually in it and who walk the talk. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1149.68s)]
*  Walk the walk, don't just talk about it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1155.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's really where the idea for the show started. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1157.96s)]
*  And sorry, it's such a long-winded answer, but I would also just say about it, man, the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  trepidation I have in doing the show is quelled a bit because I just really, really believe [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1169.92s)]
*  in the folks that come on. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  The show is not about me. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1180.48s)]
*  I don't think I'm particularly good at it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1183.52s)]
*  I don't think I'm particularly that interesting of a guy to be leading these conversations. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1187.04s)]
*  What I think I have is this unbelievable group of friends, both because of how I grew up [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1194.48s)]
*  and because of what I do for a living, that people talk to me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1201.16s)]
*  And I've become really, really close with them. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1205.48s)]
*  And asking somebody to come on and talk about these things, it's not easy. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1208.24s)]
*  It comes at a cost. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1212.8s)]
*  But I'm really grateful for it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1214.96s)]
*  Giving these folks a platform, these are precisely the people that I want my kids listening to [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1218.72s)]
*  and the two things in my life that are most important. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1223.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's my work and it's my family. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1227.76s)]
*  So at times those are opposed to each other, but ultimately I really believe in it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1230.3200000000002s)]
*  How long did this do in your mind before you ultimately decided to do something? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1234.88s)]
*  It's stood in my mind for a while. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1242.24s)]
*  And we started doing them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1244.16s)]
*  And it sort of fits in. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  So what was the first one? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1248.2s)]
*  So the first one that we did was exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1249.68s)]
*  We did it with my friend Jerry Belasteros, who's a crash unit cop. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1252.96s)]
*  So how does this conversation start? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1258.0s)]
*  How do you decide to start doing this? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1260.0s)]
*  How do you say, you know what, I'm going to sit down with people where you just like, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1262.72s)]
*  I don't feel like their side's being represented. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1267.96s)]
*  I feel like I have something to add to this or I feel like I have a unique position. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1271.24s)]
*  Not me. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1275.6s)]
*  Where I can kind of bring people together. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1276.6s)]
*  Yeah, not me. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1277.6s)]
*  Them. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1278.6s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there's that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1279.6s)]
*  And I have friends who, especially if you look at South Central, specifically, Newton [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1281.24s)]
*  Division in South Central, it's historically one of the most violent, they call it a shoot [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1292.28s)]
*  Newton, one of the most violent precincts in the entire city. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1299.72s)]
*  I was enormously close with some of the guys in that precinct. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1304.8s)]
*  Jerry Belasteros is sort of this legendary cop there. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1309.04s)]
*  He's lost people on the street and he's gone all the way. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1313.0s)]
*  And he's a guy that's respected. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1320.04s)]
*  I believe in his reasons. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1322.64s)]
*  Was he the first guy you sat down with? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1324.04s)]
*  So he's the first guy I sat down with, but I sat down with him and I sat down with a [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1325.96s)]
*  guy named Dante Johnson. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1332.28s)]
*  People call him Bojangles on the street. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1334.4s)]
*  He grew up in the Pueblo Bishop Housing Projects. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1335.88s)]
*  The Pueblo Bishop Housing Projects and Newton Division are right next to each other. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1338.68s)]
*  They've been sort of set against each other forever. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1344.0s)]
*  People call him Bojangles, like I said. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1349.0800000000002s)]
*  He's a community activist. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1351.4s)]
*  He's somebody who's given so much back to the community of the Pueblos. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1353.0s)]
*  But he was also, he was part of the Pueblo, and still is part of the Pueblo Bishop Bloods. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1358.16s)]
*  And these guys knew each other. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1364.6000000000001s)]
*  They knew of each other. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1366.68s)]
*  They'd come into contact with each other in the street. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1367.68s)]
*  And at first, getting them together was difficult. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1374.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a big first step. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  You're going to get into podcasting. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a very big undertaking. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1380.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but again, it's, I don't know. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  You just felt compelled? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1387.3200000000002s)]
*  I did. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1388.5600000000002s)]
*  I did. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1389.5600000000002s)]
*  And look, I think at the time, my cousin was in a band called Fountains of Wayne, and right [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1390.5600000000002s)]
*  in the beginning of COVID, when it was first sort of popping off, he died way too early, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1396.48s)]
*  left two daughters behind. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1403.52s)]
*  Only person in my family really that showed me that it was possible to kind of be an artist. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  And it was really, he died real early. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1412.44s)]
*  He was sort of like, hey, I'm sick, and I'm going into the hospital now. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1416.0800000000002s)]
*  I got this thing, and hey, I'm on a ventilator, and never came out. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1420.92s)]
*  His parents couldn't go visit him. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1427.32s)]
*  His kids couldn't go visit him, even though they were a mile apart because they closed [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1428.56s)]
*  off the hospitals. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1431.4399999999998s)]
*  And I live up in Ojai, California, in a place that COVID almost didn't really exist there [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1432.4399999999998s)]
*  at the time. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1442.32s)]
*  But then again, when the George Floyd uprising popped off, I really wanted to get out. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1443.32s)]
*  I really wanted to be a part of that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1448.9199999999998s)]
*  But then again, when I saw the anti-police movement, anytime I'd go in protest, I'd also [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1452.24s)]
*  stop by Newton Division and just pay my respects. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1456.08s)]
*  And I just was so frustrated that I couldn't be both. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1458.6799999999998s)]
*  I couldn't, so pro Black Lives Matter, but also super pro law enforcement, and understand [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  that these things are not mutually exclusive. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1468.08s)]
*  So that's kind of where the idea came from. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1470.0s)]
*  But with these guys specifically, it was really hard to get them together. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1472.24s)]
*  There had been an officer-involved shooting at the Pueblos right at that time, and there [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1479.1999999999998s)]
*  was an ongoing case. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1484.56s)]
*  And what was interesting, the way that we came around is Bo, he started an acting school [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1486.12s)]
*  in the Pueblos in South Central with Shia LaBeouf years ago called Sloss and Rec. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1494.2s)]
*  And Bo himself is an acting student and an actor himself. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1500.84s)]
*  And there's a show that I wrote about Shreveport, Louisiana, and I wanted to do a reading of [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1505.76s)]
*  it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1513.52s)]
*  And so I got Bo and a bunch of guys from the Pueblos, some of whom were active gang members, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1514.52s)]
*  to do this reading of the show. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1521.68s)]
*  And I brought in a bunch of industry people and a bunch of agents and managers to come [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1523.2s)]
*  give these guys an opportunity. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  But the place that we had the reading was at a place that was sort of run by my friend [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1528.86s)]
*  who's in the LAPD. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1534.02s)]
*  So you had these cops coming in at that time, setting up chairs and hanging lights. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1535.48s)]
*  And you had these ex and current gang members performing. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1540.34s)]
*  And to put them all on mission together and put them all sort of into it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1544.26s)]
*  By the end, everyone's hugging each other. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1547.74s)]
*  And now, you know, we're setting up a show with Jerry and Bo where they both love fishing. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1549.22s)]
*  So they're going fishing and they're taking people fishing with them. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  But this is the whole thesis. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1556.34s)]
*  And what I expected to happen really did. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1557.9399999999998s)]
*  I know these two men. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1561.26s)]
*  I believe in these two men with all my heart. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1562.86s)]
*  I respect these two men limitlessly. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1564.94s)]
*  And I knew that they would laugh at the same shit. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1570.48s)]
*  I knew that they would be finishing each other's sentences. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1572.5s)]
*  Their experience is what binds them. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1575.16s)]
*  And again, they can point out flaws in each other. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1577.68s)]
*  And at times they do in the episode. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1580.3s)]
*  They can point out flaws with the system. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1582.7s)]
*  They can talk about things that are grossly unfair. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1584.3s)]
*  You know, this is one of the things that sort of came out that was so interesting is, you [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1588.14s)]
*  Jerry was talking about being a decades long veteran of the LAPD. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1592.54s)]
*  Places would give him free coffee. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1600.66s)]
*  He would go eat for free. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1601.9s)]
*  But now walking in in uniform, people wouldn't let them in. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1602.98s)]
*  They're establishments. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1608.04s)]
*  And on the other side, you got Bo saying, yeah, I've lived with that my whole life, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1609.54s)]
*  man. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1615.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1616.5s)]
*  And there's real points of connection that way. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1617.5s)]
*  And then I just think from there, it just, you know, I believed in that in that thesis [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1621.06s)]
*  and we just kind of kept it going. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1627.1s)]
*  And I got a group of people around me that I think really believe in it as well. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, man, it's it's so this is what we're doing. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  One of the things that separates people so much is the lack of communication. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1635.6599999999999s)]
*  And the fact that you're able to get those two guys to sit down and communicate that [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1640.1399999999999s)]
*  opens up doors to so many other people and opens up doors of possibility in people's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1644.1s)]
*  minds where they can watch that conversation and go, you know what, at the end of the day, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1648.6599999999999s)]
*  we're all just people and we all believe in what we believe in. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1653.1799999999998s)]
*  And oftentimes we look at the other people on the other side as being the opposite or [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1656.2199999999998s)]
*  being the enemy when, in fact, they're just other human beings. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1661.62s)]
*  That's it. We have way more in common than we do like conflict. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1664.2199999999998s)]
*  And I think with the ice with how isolated everyone is and everyone wants to say, I'm [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1668.4599999999998s)]
*  on this side or on this side. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1674.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like if these two guys can sit down to each other who have, again, lost freedom, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1675.98s)]
*  lost lives, lost friends, taken lives, you know, in this so-called war, but they can [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1680.42s)]
*  actually sit down and strike a real genuine friendship and then go fishing and then go [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1685.8200000000002s)]
*  fucking fishing. Like, what are you doing? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1690.02s)]
*  Like standing on the side being like, I hate those people, but you never you know what [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1691.66s)]
*  I mean? And and and yeah, I believe in that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1694.9s)]
*  I believe in that with with all my heart. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1698.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, what disturbs me is that that absolute lack of nuance that some people have where [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1700.42s)]
*  it's this side is bad, that side is bad. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1706.1000000000001s)]
*  And all that is exacerbated not just by social media, but also by foreign entities that [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1708.8200000000002s)]
*  are embedded in social media that continually stir up this sort of strife and stir up this [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1715.74s)]
*  conflict. And it's done intentionally to try to divide us. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1720.9s)]
*  That sounds like very tinfoil hat, but it's all been proven that this is going on. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1724.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know, man. It's so clearly it's so clearly a weakness. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1729.3400000000001s)]
*  It's so clearly a weakness in the fabric and the structure of our society. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1734.7s)]
*  So, of course, there, you know, look, man, I lived in Moscow for for for two years. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1739.74s)]
*  And yeah, what are you doing over there? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1744.58s)]
*  You know, I I was really kind of a fuck up as a kid, Joe. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1746.38s)]
*  And all my favorite people were. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1751.74s)]
*  Oh, boy. Yeah, I took it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1753.78s)]
*  I don't know. I took it to a different level, maybe. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1755.9s)]
*  But I I was really lost as a kid, got into a ton of trouble, went to school, played a [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1757.82s)]
*  little bit of sports in school, but I was getting in a lot of trouble, trouble with [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1764.14s)]
*  the law, trouble, you know, ended up not being able to finish school. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1769.46s)]
*  And I got really into acting in in college, almost as a whim, no, no aim. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1772.98s)]
*  It was just almost on accident. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1778.74s)]
*  And I met a wonderful woman there named Alma Becker, and she she ended up marrying my [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1780.3400000000001s)]
*  wife and I. She's and she was sort of fascinated with Eastern European and Russian [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1786.6200000000001s)]
*  theater. And when I got done sort of like being in trouble and I went school when I [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1793.06s)]
*  couldn't finish school, I decided this is really what I wanted to do. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1798.6599999999999s)]
*  And I really wanted to be an actor. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1802.1799999999998s)]
*  But I had no kind of frame of reference. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1803.82s)]
*  I didn't think it was any different than being a plumber, being a lawyer, being a cop. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1806.3s)]
*  Like, what are the steps I have to do? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1809.98s)]
*  This is what I want to do for a living. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1811.3s)]
*  She sort of explained, well, it doesn't really quite work that way. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1813.02s)]
*  But, you know, she said that, look, if if if if she were I, you know, she she thought [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1815.4199999999998s)]
*  the best theater school in the world was was the Moscow Art Theater in Russia. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1821.78s)]
*  And she said, you know, I can get you an audition for that school. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1825.54s)]
*  Best theater in the world is in Russia, according to her. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1827.98s)]
*  And and and I certainly believe that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1831.7s)]
*  I mean, if you if you look at it, I mean, kind of historically, you know, all of acting [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1834.86s)]
*  that that that we you know, that we celebrate is is, you know, was was really like the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1840.58s)]
*  kernel of that all started at that theater at the Moscow Art Theater. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1846.74s)]
*  Stanislavski and Chekhov. Yeah. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1850.06s)]
*  Yeah. The first play they did was The Seagull. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1851.6599999999999s)]
*  And they they they they they put that play together in a summer home outside Moscow. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1853.74s)]
*  And then they came into the city and they put it on. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1860.26s)]
*  And up until that point. What year was this? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1861.9399999999998s)]
*  There's not this was in the 1920s. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1864.06s)]
*  So basically all theater, all acting up until that point was very presentational. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1866.54s)]
*  It was very go to the front of the stage and kind of proclaim to the audience, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1870.3799999999999s)]
*  you know, face outward. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1875.86s)]
*  And what they would stay in a slosky came up with what you hear and his method, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1877.02s)]
*  which is not, you know, like sitting in your own shit or having people call you your [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1883.06s)]
*  character name, that that that is not method acting. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1888.02s)]
*  This method that that he came up with was really about realism on stage. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1890.94s)]
*  So if you're drinking tea in a scene, really drink tea. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1895.98s)]
*  Turn your back to the audience. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1899.06s)]
*  Talk as if you're actually in the situation. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1900.34s)]
*  And in 1933, they went on a world tour with this play, The Seagull. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1902.86s)]
*  They went through Europe and then they went to America. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1908.22s)]
*  They went to San Francisco, to Chicago and to New York. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1910.1799999999998s)]
*  And that changed acting. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1913.1799999999998s)]
*  All of the sort of great American theater training, you know, from the group theater [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1914.3799999999999s)]
*  with Strasburg and Newtahoggin, it all came out of their exposure to this one play. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1918.86s)]
*  Nobody had ever seen acting like that. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1923.22s)]
*  And it all started at this school. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1924.9399999999998s)]
*  How did they figure that out? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1926.8999999999999s)]
*  How did who figure that out? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1928.46s)]
*  The Russians. What was the genesis of that? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1929.7s)]
*  You know, I think it was, you know, it was this unbelievable conglomeration of a [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1932.1s)]
*  rejection of of how theater was before that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1938.74s)]
*  But also, you know, like so many things, it takes a sort of perfect storm of people [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1942.1399999999999s)]
*  coming together. You had Chekhov who, you know, look in the in the Eastern European [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1946.34s)]
*  world and, you know, Chekhov to Russia is very much what Shakespeare is to us. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1952.6599999999999s)]
*  You have this guy who is writing in this unbelievably realistic way, who, you know, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1958.78s)]
*  examine human behavior. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1964.18s)]
*  He was a doctor and he really looked at it. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1965.82s)]
*  He really looked at life sort of in this sort of like omnipotent or omnipresent way, like [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1969.58s)]
*  he was looking down on it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1974.94s)]
*  For example, you would have somebody who was you have a love story. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1976.02s)]
*  The Seagull, there's always some confusion because it's called a comedy, but it's really [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1982.58s)]
*  ultimately the lead character takes his own life, kills himself at the end. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1986.42s)]
*  And it's very tragic. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1990.0200000000002s)]
*  But from a doctor, there was something really funny about all these people who are in love [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1991.5s)]
*  with the wrong person. I'm spending my life wanting to love this person. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1995.94s)]
*  I want this so bad. Yeah. But right next to you is a person who really loves you. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=1999.14s)]
*  And you're ignoring that and just sort of the feebleness and the fragility of human [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2002.66s)]
*  behavior and really examining it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2007.14s)]
*  These small characters giving them real emotional life on stage, you know, that's [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2009.7800000000002s)]
*  so you had this in the writing and then you had this brilliant actor, director, Stanislavski, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2016.06s)]
*  who just thought, you know, what if we actually play this for real? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2023.5s)]
*  And it was a completely revolutionary thing. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2026.6599999999999s)]
*  It changed, changed everything. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  It changed. It's the style of film acting and theater acting that that is literally [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2030.06s)]
*  taken over everything today. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2035.26s)]
*  That's fascinating. I would have never known that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2036.86s)]
*  And so you go over there and what is it like to go over to Russia? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2039.54s)]
*  Did you understand speak Russian? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2042.9399999999998s)]
*  Did you have to learn that? Did they speak English? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2045.62s)]
*  So I was over there in the late 90s. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2049.5s)]
*  It was a totally wild time to be there. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2051.62s)]
*  And I think looking back at, you know, maybe why Alma wanted me to be there was, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2053.94s)]
*  you know, probably because I was such a wild kid and I was so lost and doing so much [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2060.2599999999998s)]
*  kind of fucked up stuff. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2064.66s)]
*  So you just pack up your shit. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2065.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man. And back that, you know, no email, no, you know, no phone. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2067.42s)]
*  You know, you go over there and it's like, you know, you don't talk to anybody. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2070.7s)]
*  You don't talk to anybody from your life here. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2073.42s)]
*  And I think very much I think she knew I needed to get out of here. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2075.34s)]
*  And so I think that that was part of it for her. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2079.1400000000003s)]
*  But, you know, Russia, you know, I can't I mean, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2081.98s)]
*  the way I would describe it is unbelievable beauty with with [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2088.38s)]
*  unbelievable brutality. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2093.42s)]
*  For me, there's no way I would be doing what I do today if it wasn't for my time [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2096.5800000000004s)]
*  spent there. You have this unbelievable appreciation [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2101.78s)]
*  for the arts on every corner. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2106.94s)]
*  There's a statue of a playwright or a poet or an actor. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2110.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, being an actor was an enormously masculine thing to do. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2113.1000000000004s)]
*  It was that the training itself was was highly rigorous, you know, from playing [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2117.3s)]
*  college sports and, you know, do fight training. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2123.02s)]
*  It was by far without a doubt the most [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2126.3799999999997s)]
*  disciplined and physically strenuous work that I've ever done in my life. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2130.3399999999997s)]
*  So basically, the way that the school works is, you know, you have thousands of kids [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2136.14s)]
*  that audition and then every they take 100. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2139.2999999999997s)]
*  And then every semester, they'll cut that class in half. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2144.58s)]
*  So you're you're kind of fighting for your life the whole time you're there. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2147.8199999999997s)]
*  And they'll graduate 10 kids. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2150.94s)]
*  And these kids are coming from all over the country. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2152.5s)]
*  And it's really kind of like if you get into that school, it's kind of like this [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2155.26s)]
*  golden ticket. It's kind of like, you know, there's there's there's at the time [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2158.46s)]
*  there's 10 times more theaters in Moscow than there were in New York. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2163.34s)]
*  Theater is religion there. And I I'll definitely explain to you sort of why that is, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2165.82s)]
*  especially coming out of communism and how important theater was and the role it played. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2170.1400000000003s)]
*  But if you graduate from one of those schools, it's not like in America, where a lot [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2174.7000000000003s)]
*  of theater training is very coddling and it's very like, OK, you can't really play [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2179.7000000000003s)]
*  sports. You're not the best student, but come to the theater where you can be a tree [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2182.62s)]
*  and everybody's kumbaya and we get along. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2185.8599999999997s)]
*  If you can get through one of those schools, you're funneled into one of the major theater [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2188.42s)]
*  companies. It's such a huge achievement. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2192.06s)]
*  They're kind of guaranteed employment after that. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2195.2599999999998s)]
*  And the people that get the honor of teaching in Russia, it's the highest honor you [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2198.58s)]
*  can achieve. So my teacher, Oleg Tabakov, he'd be the equivalent of like Robert De Niro [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2203.98s)]
*  here. It's so, you know, if an acting teacher walks into a room, it doesn't matter even [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2208.7s)]
*  if you're in public. If you're a student of that school, you have to stand up and you [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2213.58s)]
*  can't sit down until they sit down. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2217.18s)]
*  And there's just this this unbelievable respect that's built in. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2218.74s)]
*  You need to learn acrobatics. You have to train ballet. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2221.8199999999997s)]
*  You have to do acrobatics. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2224.66s)]
*  Acrobatics. So you were training in acrobatics and ballet while you were learning acting? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2225.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and how do they structure that? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  How do they structure? What? How do they structure that kind of training? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2233.74s)]
*  So it's it's it's you know, at first in the first year, I mean, look, in the in the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2236.58s)]
*  first year you're there, there's no there's no text. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2241.46s)]
*  I mean, all of the training is in your voice and in your body and in rhythm. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2244.22s)]
*  You learn rhythm, which is something that's like not taught here. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2248.58s)]
*  Rhythm of communication, everything, everything. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2252.14s)]
*  So rhythm of objects like literally just learning. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2254.66s)]
*  It's just it's it's studying rhythm. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2258.54s)]
*  So you and I would be able we would be tasked with putting on a show, completing [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2261.02s)]
*  rhythms like off rhythms and and. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2265.7400000000002s)]
*  How do I explain it? Like I give you I'll give you an example. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2270.42s)]
*  You know, like one of the training exercises would be. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2273.14s)]
*  Training your attention, your concentration, right? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2278.54s)]
*  So you would read a newspaper article and you would just they would tell you to [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2280.7400000000002s)]
*  concentrate on one paragraph and you would read that to yourself. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2285.62s)]
*  And while that's happening, everyone in the class would be asking questions. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2289.18s)]
*  Say, Jamie, what what color socks are you wearing today? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2294.46s)]
*  He would answer. Then Jamie would say, Joe, what did you have for breakfast? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2297.82s)]
*  You would answer somebody else. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2301.06s)]
*  We would go around and everybody would while you're reading the article. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2302.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, the teacher would be clapping, snapping or coughing. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2305.46s)]
*  When it was over. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2310.02s)]
*  He would point to anyone in the class. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2312.18s)]
*  You have to know how many times he snapped, how many times he coughed, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2313.66s)]
*  how many times he clapped. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2316.2200000000003s)]
*  Then he would go around and you would say, what did Jamie eat for breakfast today? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2317.62s)]
*  You would have to know all that. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2320.54s)]
*  And then he'd have you stand up and you would have to recite the paragraph [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2321.42s)]
*  that you just read and you would have to be able to answer any of those questions. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2324.7799999999997s)]
*  So it's these these these actions. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2328.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's kind of what the method was. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2329.8599999999997s)]
*  And then when you get into the acrobatics, it's really, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2332.18s)]
*  really getting just much, much more limber. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2334.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, I was I played football and baseball. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2337.22s)]
*  I played in college. I was very, very sort of, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2339.14s)]
*  you know, I lifted weights. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2342.8599999999997s)]
*  I was a very just tight person. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2343.8199999999997s)]
*  So it was just like partner stretching, stretching the shit out of yourself [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2345.98s)]
*  and then learning how to do, you know, have people kind of climb up your body, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2349.66s)]
*  learning how to you either support. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2353.54s)]
*  I guess the equivalent would be like gymnastics or some sort of like, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2355.5s)]
*  you know, high level tumbling. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2359.38s)]
*  But you have to do all that ballet as well. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2360.94s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, not until the second year are you actually, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2364.62s)]
*  you know, speaking text, you know, all of it is just movement based observation based. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2368.26s)]
*  So it's almost like a boot camp. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2373.26s)]
*  Like they're building you up. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2375.38s)]
*  I think so. And then every, you know, every couple of months, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2377.34s)]
*  they let you know that whether you're allowed to come back or not. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2381.06s)]
*  And so you have people's, you know, dreams kind of shattered. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2384.1s)]
*  And I think more than anything else, man, it's the. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2387.1400000000003s)]
*  The vitality of it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2392.78s)]
*  You know, look, during communist times, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2394.02s)]
*  public gathering was outlawed. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2397.78s)]
*  So, you know, you can go to church, you can you can get a group of people together [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2400.06s)]
*  and speak, you know, audiences were illegal [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2404.1s)]
*  unless they were politically based and controlled by the Kremlin. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2407.38s)]
*  So there were a couple of state based theaters, state run theaters in Moscow, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2411.18s)]
*  one of them being the Moscow Art Theater. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2416.14s)]
*  But they had to do pro state [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2418.86s)]
*  shows. And the thing is, is a lot of these people, you know, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2422.46s)]
*  Meyerhold, for example, is one of the most famous Russian directors. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2427.2599999999998s)]
*  He would be he was he was lauded by the state [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2430.1800000000003s)]
*  as this, you know, unbelievable hero of the Russian theater. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2433.94s)]
*  And, you know, they would go and they would see his plays. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2437.38s)]
*  But then somebody looked at it and all of a sudden they said, you know what? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2441.82s)]
*  I think there's actually an anti-state message here. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2444.54s)]
*  They executed him in his in his apartment. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2447.5s)]
*  So actors were sent to prison for being in a play [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2450.7400000000002s)]
*  that all of a sudden somebody just deemed as anti-state. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2453.82s)]
*  And and and you know, for me, you know, my main teachers. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2456.98s)]
*  You know, they were they did this play called Chinzano, which was [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2462.1s)]
*  about three guys, one of them lost their moms, three three best friends, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2467.58s)]
*  one of them lost their mom. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2471.38s)]
*  And it's just the three of them sitting in this apartment [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2472.86s)]
*  drinking a bottle of Chinzano and just sort of lamenting about this loss. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2475.22s)]
*  And they've been putting this play on for 30 years. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2478.74s)]
*  Once they were my teachers during communist times. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2481.62s)]
*  So they would do this play in subway tunnels and abandoned buildings. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2484.1s)]
*  Had they been caught, they would have been imprisoned. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2487.98s)]
*  Anybody who was in that audience would have been imprisoned [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2489.86s)]
*  for going to watch that show. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2492.42s)]
*  But they did it anyway, because it was that vital to them. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2493.9s)]
*  It was that important to them. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2495.98s)]
*  And, you know, for me, you know, again, thinking, you know, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2497.46s)]
*  I'm this like kind of tough kid from from from D.C. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2500.7400000000002s)]
*  and that I knew what the hell I was talking about, like being around that, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2504.06s)]
*  being around people that were that were operating with that set of stakes. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2507.1800000000003s)]
*  Where the history, the palpability of [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2512.74s)]
*  the tumultuous history that is alive in every breath in that city. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2518.34s)]
*  Again, the beauty and the brutality. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2523.06s)]
*  It was it was a game changer for me. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2525.7s)]
*  I mean, look, man, my, you know, one sort of brief anecdote. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2527.54s)]
*  You know, when I when I first went over there, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2532.82s)]
*  I think my third day there was was was my birthday. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2535.82s)]
*  And, you know, again, just [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2540.02s)]
*  I lived in a place called Park Kultury, which is Gorky Park. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2542.5800000000004s)]
*  It's kind of a pretty rough sort of shitty area in Moscow. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2545.1000000000004s)]
*  And I had a translator. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2548.5s)]
*  I spoke no Russian at all when I first went over there. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2550.0600000000004s)]
*  And my translator, Max, came and picked me up where I was living. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2552.6200000000003s)]
*  And he took me to the Moscow Art Theater, which is on Tverskaya [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2558.1800000000003s)]
*  right across the street from Red Square. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2560.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a few subway stops in a couple of different directions to get there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2562.6200000000003s)]
*  And once we got there, the one thing that they tell you [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2566.02s)]
*  that's absolutely essential at all times, you always have to have your papers [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2568.9s)]
*  back then. At that point, the mayor ran the mafia, the mayor's police. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2572.1s)]
*  They didn't really have a salary. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2576.26s)]
*  They made their money by what they could sort of shake people down for. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2577.62s)]
*  So we get to the theater, you know, my birthday and my first day of school. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2581.54s)]
*  And I think like I'm actually making something of my life. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2587.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm here in Russia, but maybe in the fuck up that I am, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2590.02s)]
*  I forgot my papers because I'm just a just, you know, unadulterated asshole. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2592.1s)]
*  And I said to Max, man, I'm so sorry, man, I forgot my papers. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2596.34s)]
*  You know, and he said, OK, well, we got to go back and get them. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2598.98s)]
*  And I said, no, man, let's just go into school and we'll do it the next day. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2602.78s)]
*  He said, no, they're not going to let you into the school without your papers. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2606.54s)]
*  Let's go back and get them. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2608.86s)]
*  I said, look, man, I'm a grown ass man. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2609.7000000000003s)]
*  Let me go back and get my papers. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2611.02s)]
*  You don't have to come with me. You just took me here. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2612.46s)]
*  So I convinced him to let me go by myself. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2615.2200000000003s)]
*  And then again, me being the asshole that I am and everything's in Cyrillic, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2617.1000000000004s)]
*  I couldn't read anything. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2620.2200000000003s)]
*  I got completely fucking lost. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2621.1800000000003s)]
*  And I just had no idea where I was. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2622.94s)]
*  I'm three days in Russia. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2624.78s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm it's getting dark. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2627.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm screwing up. I finally make it back to my place. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2629.46s)]
*  I get my papers. I make it back to the school. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2631.94s)]
*  But now I've missed the first day. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2634.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like completely dark. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2635.26s)]
*  And I'm on the wrong side of Tverskaya, which is like this main street, about 16 lanes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2636.3s)]
*  And I got to get to the other side to get to school. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2641.6600000000003s)]
*  And I just start kind of like like Frogger. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2644.34s)]
*  I'm like dodging cars like a total asshole. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2646.5400000000004s)]
*  And like, I can't get to the other side. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2648.6200000000003s)]
*  Soon as I get to the other side, boom. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2650.1400000000003s)]
*  AK-47 is in my face. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2653.22s)]
*  Russian police are right there. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2654.8999999999996s)]
*  They get me for crossing. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2656.3399999999997s)]
*  You're supposed to cross below. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2657.7s)]
*  I didn't know that. They're yelling at me in Russian. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2658.74s)]
*  I give them 20 rubles. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2660.4199999999996s)]
*  They let me go. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2662.3399999999997s)]
*  And I'm just like just such an asshole. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2663.2999999999997s)]
*  It's my birthday. I've missed my first day. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2664.98s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2666.58s)]
*  And so I do what any good American would do. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2668.1s)]
*  I go and treat myself to a meal at McDonald's. Right. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2670.46s)]
*  So I go and I get myself some McDonald's. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2672.8599999999997s)]
*  Happy birthday to me. You're a fuck up. Right. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2674.4199999999996s)]
*  Then I'm going back that night and I'm back in Parkle Toury and I'm walking down the street. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2677.06s)]
*  I'm all by myself. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2681.62s)]
*  It's pitch black out. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2682.9s)]
*  It's cold as fuck. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2683.94s)]
*  And I'm walking down the street and this Mercedes pulls up in front of me. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2685.2200000000003s)]
*  And these two guys get out of the front seat and they reach into the back seat and they grab something out. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2690.42s)]
*  And I see it's this woman with beautiful red hair and she's in like a beautiful cocktail dress. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2697.86s)]
*  And they're pulling her out of the back seat of this Mercedes. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2706.54s)]
*  And I'm the only one on the street. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2710.58s)]
*  And they clearly don't see me. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2712.18s)]
*  But this woman sees me. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2713.3799999999997s)]
*  She makes like direct eye contact with me. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2714.58s)]
*  And they're pulling her out of the side. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2718.14s)]
*  They're pulling her out of the back seat. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2719.94s)]
*  She's not fighting them, but she's not helping them either. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2721.14s)]
*  She's just like completely limp and just being dragged. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2723.66s)]
*  They take her over to this building and they just start like opening her head up against the side of this building and start smashing her head. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2726.3399999999997s)]
*  So I like forgot where I was. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2733.8199999999997s)]
*  And like I ran at this guy and I grabbed him in English. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2735.74s)]
*  I'm like, man, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2740.5s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2742.02s)]
*  And he just pulled out a gun. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2743.38s)]
*  He just put it like right to my forehead. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2746.38s)]
*  And he said in English, she's like, go away like that. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2748.98s)]
*  And, you know, Joe, I knew like in an instant, man, I knew in an instant that like it was like I was a bug. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2751.94s)]
*  Like I was a bug. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2760.46s)]
*  Like that was a different. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2761.22s)]
*  I'd met, I'd seen guns before I'd seen stuff before. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2762.46s)]
*  I just knew that this was a completely different level. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2765.5s)]
*  And so, you know, I walked away listening to that, listening to what they were doing. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2767.98s)]
*  And I was like day three. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2771.5s)]
*  So that's on the brutality side of it. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2773.5s)]
*  But I think conversely on the on the beauty side of it, you know, there was just it was it was it was a culture that I found like completely free of pretension. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2777.06s)]
*  You know, if you have a conversation with somebody, you really have a conversation. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2788.5s)]
*  You look in the eye and there's no hey, how you doing? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2791.78s)]
*  Hey, I'm doing great. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2793.94s)]
*  There's no bullshit. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2794.58s)]
*  It wouldn't be strange or weird for to have somebody break down in tears. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2795.94s)]
*  In your first meeting and talking to them and not because they're sort of like emotionally fragile or weak, but because they're just so honest and in the moment. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2801.34s)]
*  I saw this unbelievable national appreciation for the arts. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2809.26s)]
*  I saw people who, you know, you go on the subways and people weren't reading, you know, Us Weekly. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2815.1800000000003s)]
*  They were reading Bulgakov and Tolstoy. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2823.46s)]
*  It's an unbelievable, unbelievably literate society. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2825.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2828.94s)]
*  I'm so grateful for my time there. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2830.82s)]
*  And it really, you know, all my and that place really, really saved my life. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2833.9s)]
*  How bizarre is it for you now to see this conflict that we're going through with Russia and Ukraine and the United States involvement? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2839.46s)]
*  Having spent time there. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2849.02s)]
*  Um, you know, I. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2850.94s)]
*  You know, I. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2855.3799999999997s)]
*  I feel horrible. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2857.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm devastated for, you know, my friends there. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2860.74s)]
*  I'm devastated for. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2864.58s)]
*  It's such a different it's such a different Moscow. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2868.54s)]
*  It's such a different Russia than than than what I knew. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2871.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, there was there was a free press there when I when I was there. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2874.94s)]
*  It was it was like, you know, I felt it was the Wild West, man. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2879.3s)]
*  It was it was everybody was exploding, you know, in this this this new freedom. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2884.6600000000003s)]
*  And it was such an optimistic you could feel the fragility. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2889.9s)]
*  But there was also, man. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2897.78s)]
*  You know, if if if somebody if you bump somebody's foot by accident, standing on a sidewalk, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2901.1400000000003s)]
*  they have to step on your foot. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2907.78s)]
*  It's like a Russian tradition. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2909.58s)]
*  So if like you bump into somebody, they have to bump into you back. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2911.34s)]
*  If if there's a line, you know, a lot of people just didn't believe in lines. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2915.9s)]
*  So like somebody will just cut right in front of you. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2920.62s)]
*  You know, I remember when there was the the situation at the Russian theater, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2923.9s)]
*  there's a hostage situation where they just kind of went in and those people were being held hostage. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2927.58s)]
*  So they put it in gas and they just kind of killed everybody. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2932.98s)]
*  I think there's something about, you know, I had a friend who was in the FSB, a young young guy. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2937.98s)]
*  And if there was an issue with the police, if we were being loud or somebody was trying to shake us down, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2943.38s)]
*  you know, I had this 21 year old friend who was in the FSB and this 21 year old kid, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2947.98s)]
*  you know, could could yield such unbelievable power just by like put the fear of God [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2952.86s)]
*  in in soldiers with guns like that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2959.62s)]
*  And and that's something I don't I don't know that we have an equivalent of that. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2962.78s)]
*  I saw that there was. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2968.02s)]
*  I remember then talking about Putin and with George Bush at the time. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2970.82s)]
*  I remember there was that thing and like, you know, I looked into his soul and it's like a great man. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2975.7400000000002s)]
*  And we really connected there. There was. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2980.26s)]
*  There was this thing that there was an understanding among [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2983.62s)]
*  Moscovites that he would just toy with this guy and things like deception and things like [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2986.7000000000003s)]
*  manipulation were things that were celebrated in a leader. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2991.34s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2995.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, we do the same shit, but we we're not allowed to talk about it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=2996.94s)]
*  We're not allowed to celebrate it. It's un-American. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3000.14s)]
*  But but that style of being being [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3002.14s)]
*  ruling with an iron fist, you know, it was still that was so very celebrated. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3005.74s)]
*  And many Russians, I think, really scribe to that. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3011.38s)]
*  So so I guess. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3014.9s)]
*  I'm heartbroken, you know, I'm heartbroken and and. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3019.06s)]
*  I'm heartbroken for all the people that, you know, all the all the young men that that have fled [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3023.1800000000003s)]
*  and left and the families that are being torn apart, I'm heartbroken for what's going on in Ukraine. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3027.98s)]
*  But I guess I'm not I'm not that surprised, you know. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3033.5s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3037.1800000000003s)]
*  The the strong leader that that is such a big part of Russia and to have this powerful leader [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3038.1800000000003s)]
*  who leads with an iron fist, that seems to be something that they embrace. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3046.7000000000003s)]
*  It's a part of the culture. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3052.1s)]
*  It's part of the history of that part of the world. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3053.4199999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. And making hard decisions and and understanding that things. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3057.7s)]
*  You know, aren't clean. I mean, look at you. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3063.4199999999996s)]
*  You know, I think many Russians would would look at, you know. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3067.1s)]
*  You know, World War Two and the way that they handled that war [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3071.8199999999997s)]
*  and the way that they approached that war militarily, you know, was, you know, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3074.54s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how it's interesting. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3079.9s)]
*  I don't know if that would fly here. But but but. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3082.42s)]
*  Well, look what they're doing in Ukraine when they have these mobile crematoriums [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3084.86s)]
*  and they're just taking the Russian soldiers that die and just. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3089.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, I have a count of the bodies. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3093.42s)]
*  There's not even an accurate count of casualties. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3097.02s)]
*  And and and and and look, I think, you know, one gun for every five guys in World War Two. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3099.1s)]
*  You know, pick up, you know, when that guy does pick up the gun. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3106.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, but look, you know, you look at the way Patton approached, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3109.18s)]
*  you know, the armor, the armor units in World War Two. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3118.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, our tanks, you know, couldn't couldn't compete with the Germans tanks. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3121.7799999999997s)]
*  They just couldn't compete. They looked at those tanks. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3126.02s)]
*  They said there's just no way that a that a Sherman can compete with a tiger. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3127.74s)]
*  It's just not going to happen. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3131.2999999999997s)]
*  Why don't we do we'll build five times as many. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3132.58s)]
*  So, yes, that's an unbelievable achievement of American industry, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3134.9s)]
*  an unbelievable achievement of the war effort back home, an unbelievable achievement [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3141.34s)]
*  of the engineers that were on the front line fixing those tanks. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3146.02s)]
*  But you know, what's what's the other side of that? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3149.06s)]
*  It takes five Sherman tanks to take down one Tiger tank. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3151.82s)]
*  So we're just going to produce five times as many. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3155.58s)]
*  But think about all those tank units. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3159.1s)]
*  What does that mean for the men inside those tanks? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3160.94s)]
*  You know, what does that mean? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3164.54s)]
*  You know, that means we have to put in five times as many people [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3165.86s)]
*  and that when they go, we got to get a new unit out there, you know? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3169.38s)]
*  And that's it's it's it's very similar. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3172.3s)]
*  You know, it's a totally different mentality than we're accustomed to. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3174.82s)]
*  That's right. And the way we think of war and we think we think of sacrifice [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3177.5s)]
*  and casualties, I think so. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3181.3s)]
*  Yeah, they just seems to it seems to be a part of the culture. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3182.9s)]
*  And it seems to be something they don't have a problem with. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3186.02s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3189.66s)]
*  you know, whether they have a problem with it or not, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3192.94s)]
*  that's probably not the right probably. Yeah. Yeah. Right. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3195.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, like, I don't know, you know, it's, you know, I've had one friend of mine. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3198.06s)]
*  I can't use his name, but I've had him on the podcast a couple of times, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3201.78s)]
*  you know, from from Russia. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3205.62s)]
*  And he's he's Ukrainian and his family's in Ukraine sort of just telling us [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3207.14s)]
*  what's going on on the ground and what the sentiment is in Russia at the time. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3210.3s)]
*  And. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3215.42s)]
*  You know, I think for for a lot of people there who are who are able [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3216.26s)]
*  to sort of like ignore the propaganda and look beyond it [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3220.94s)]
*  and try to get to the truth, it's I mean, he he looks very much [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3224.7000000000003s)]
*  at his own culture and his own government as a cancer. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3230.26s)]
*  And he he he looks at at Putin as an absolute criminal. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3233.1000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, he's he's saying that, you know, he's he's he's [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3237.26s)]
*  he's risking his life by saying that and how how Putin deals with his political [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3240.42s)]
*  foes and and you know, it's I mean, even as I say this to you, man, it's it's. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3244.62s)]
*  You know, my my my gratitude. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3252.02s)]
*  You know, to that place and to that culture, it's man, it's it's limitless to me. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3254.74s)]
*  You know, it's like they again, you know, I'm able to do what I love and and [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3260.9s)]
*  and feed my kids and and and and and and and and and and and and and [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3269.02s)]
*  and and and have a family and and I'm so grateful for it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3274.5s)]
*  And it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for there. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3278.66s)]
*  And I'm just I just I don't know how this is going to end. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3280.86s)]
*  I don't know how it ends. I don't know how it works itself out. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3286.06s)]
*  You know, and I hate, you know, I hate that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3288.62s)]
*  How do they get objective information over there? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3291.66s)]
*  How do they get past propaganda? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3295.02s)]
*  Yeah. So I state sponsored and state controlled everything. Right. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3297.18s)]
*  And and and again, look, I want to be I know. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3301.1s)]
*  I'm no expert. You know, I mean, I've I've talked to the people that I've talked to. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3304.2999999999997s)]
*  And and I know for this, you know, for my one dear friend, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3307.7s)]
*  you know, he is able to access free Internet, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3313.8999999999996s)]

*  But I don't think that that's an easy thing to achieve. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3323.58s)]
*  And the contact with people in Ukraine, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3326.22s)]
*  the disparity in what the the the the propaganda and the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3331.58s)]
*  the national sort of news outlets are saying versus what people are saying on the ground. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3336.06s)]
*  You know, and then I think what was huge is is is this this this draft, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3342.66s)]
*  you know, that this was just supposed to be a military exercise. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3347.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, people are being, you know, called up. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3350.5s)]
*  And look, it is it's a. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3354.14s)]
*  One thing I'll say about being there, that that, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3356.86s)]
*  you know, really affected me as well as, you know, I've been to so many countries, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3360.54s)]
*  as I'm sure you have. And there's everybody has this sort of like [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3364.54s)]
*  nationalistic people love their country. People want to celebrate their country. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3367.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, in Russia, I'd never seen anything like it except for here. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3371.98s)]
*  You know, like if you're a strong man. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3377.02s)]
*  OK, good. Then you're a Russian man. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3379.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, you you you're good. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3381.58s)]
*  I played I played pro baseball while I was there, which is, you know, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3383.74s)]
*  definitely not a big achievement at all. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3387.2599999999998s)]
*  But, you know, you're a good baseball player. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3389.7799999999997s)]

*  than I had in really in America. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3413.78s)]
*  The unique quality of their combat sports athletes [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3417.1000000000004s)]
*  speaks to that culture. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3421.46s)]
*  Yep. Because, I mean, Fedor Emelianenko, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3423.9s)]
*  one of the if not the greatest heavyweight of all time, came from Russia. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3427.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the Dagestan region that produced Islam Akhachev [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3431.1400000000003s)]
*  and Khabib Nomorov and and, you know, uncle I have and so many elite fighters. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3435.5400000000004s)]
*  And the caliber of the athlete that comes out of there, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3441.74s)]
*  both in wrestling, other combat sports, boxing. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3445.14s)]
*  I mean, they're just very, very exceptional, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3448.9399999999996s)]
*  which speaks to the like this, the quality of the character [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3452.54s)]
*  of the people that come from that culture. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3457.54s)]
*  Yeah. And I think I think, too, you know, when you when you when you talk [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3459.8599999999997s)]
*  about the traces of Soviet times, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3464.1s)]
*  you know, you you you had a you you had a [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3467.7799999999997s)]
*  you had a you you owed it to your country, you know, to be the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3470.26s)]
*  you know, you you weren't there for your own sort of achievement or your own [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3475.5400000000004s)]
*  what you know, money that you're trying to put on the table, your own glory. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3481.26s)]
*  You know, it was about your country. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3485.38s)]
*  It was about something bigger. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3486.5s)]
*  And and see, I think people will suffer for that. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3487.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, you have in the same way, one gun for every one weapon for every five men. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3493.34s)]
*  You know, you got to work harder. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3498.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think that that's something that's really come up in this draft, too. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3499.94s)]
*  I think that even people who are adamantly against it do feel like they, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3503.2200000000003s)]
*  you know, why should this other Russian man die? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3508.34s)]
*  In my place, I'm yeah, I'm going to go. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3511.98s)]
*  Did you ever watch the documentary Icarus? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3514.94s)]
*  I didn't, but I meant to. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3517.5s)]
*  It's a crazy. It's insane. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3519.94s)]
*  But it's a big part of it is about the doping that went on during the Sochi Olympics, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3522.2200000000003s)]
*  which was all completely state sponsored, where they swapped out. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3528.1s)]
*  They they literally put performance enhancing drugs in all of their athletes, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3531.7400000000002s)]
*  every single one of them. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3537.1400000000003s)]
*  They were the ultimate goal was to achieve the highest level of performance [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3538.42s)]
*  in the Sochi Olympics to elevate Russia and to show Russian superiority. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3543.94s)]
*  And they managed to do this through this [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3549.06s)]
*  Gregory Richenkov guy. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3554.42s)]
*  And he just by total happenstance [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3556.14s)]
*  runs into this guy who produces this documentary, who is a cyclist. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3560.1s)]
*  And he decides that he wants Brian Fogel. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3565.22s)]
*  He wants to do this race completely clean. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3567.54s)]
*  And then he's going to go to Gregory and tell him like what his goals are, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3572.14s)]
*  what he wants to do. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3577.74s)]
*  And this guy is supposed to be the head of the anti doping agency in Russia. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3578.7s)]
*  But really, he's it's bullshit. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3583.62s)]
*  He's the doper. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3585.5s)]
*  And so he tells him exactly what to do and how to do it and how to cycle off. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3586.66s)]
*  And during that time, then it gets revealed while they're in the middle [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3590.74s)]
*  of filming the documentary, Brian, who's a brilliant documentarian, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3594.5s)]
*  brilliant filmmaker, just steps and shit, just totally gets lucky [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3597.94s)]
*  and finds himself in the situation where [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3601.9s)]
*  Gregory and the Soviet Union or excuse me, Russia is getting exposed [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3605.9s)]
*  for doping and he has to flee the country because he's a part of it. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3611.7s)]
*  So he comes to America and just completely spills the beans, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3615.14s)]
*  tells them exactly how they did it, what they did. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3618.58s)]
*  And now to this day, he's in witness protection and they're hiding him. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3621.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's assassination attempts on him. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3625.3799999999997s)]
*  He's he's completely fucked. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3627.1s)]
*  And they've, you know, taken his family and taken all their money [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3629.74s)]
*  and pulled them out of their homes. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3633.22s)]
*  And it's a wild, chaotic thing. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3635.02s)]
*  But it shows what kind of commitment [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3638.18s)]
*  they have to this idea of Russian exceptionalism [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3641.66s)]
*  and and Russian conquering in in sport. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3646.3399999999997s)]
*  And how far they'll take it if you reveal and if you go against them. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3649.58s)]
*  And, you know, look, you know, I was in I was in a car the other day [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3652.94s)]
*  when I when I landed here yesterday from Savannah. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3656.54s)]
*  And the guy was we were just talking about Austin. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3660.02s)]
*  We're talking about Texas. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3662.8199999999997s)]
*  And he was just a guy was from El Salvador. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3663.8199999999997s)]
*  And he was just like, you know, just like people, people in this country [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3666.3799999999997s)]
*  just don't appreciate anything, just have no idea. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3669.18s)]
*  It's the greatest country on Earth. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3673.1s)]
*  And like they just have no idea. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3674.94s)]
*  And that really that really also was and is my big takeaway [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3676.66s)]
*  for spending time over there. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3681.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, just how unbelievably lucky we are here. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3684.18s)]
*  And and I know, I mean, we started the conversation from out there [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3687.22s)]
*  about just how fucked up everything is. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3690.3799999999997s)]
*  And of course it is. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3692.22s)]
*  But like, look, man, I'm like a guy who fucking puts on makeup [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3693.42s)]
*  and says lines for a living. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3696.62s)]
*  And I can get come on here, you know, the biggest platform in the world [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3697.66s)]
*  and we can talk about it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3700.5s)]
*  And and, you know, the biggest threat, you know, to me is that like [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3701.62s)]
*  I'm going to lose an acting role. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3705.8999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like, you know, that's that's a real thing, man. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3706.98s)]
*  And I just think, you know, this country is just I just think [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3710.2999999999997s)]
*  so many people in this country have no idea how good they have it [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3715.14s)]
*  and how great, you know, to me, it's the best country on Earth. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3718.2999999999997s)]
*  It certainly isn't. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3722.42s)]
*  It's just we don't have a reference. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3723.42s)]
*  If you're here your entire life and this is how you view things, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3725.34s)]
*  you like, well, this place is fucked up. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3728.6200000000003s)]
*  That's right. And it certainly is. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3730.6200000000003s)]
*  Certainly. I mean, we're human humans. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3732.2200000000003s)]
*  We're filled with all sorts of flaws. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3735.3s)]
*  And this culture and this the way our civilization is run, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3737.38s)]
*  it's filled with all sorts of flaws. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3740.6600000000003s)]
*  But it's the best example we have for a free society. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3741.94s)]
*  That's right. Currently on Earth. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3745.38s)]
*  Which is hard for people to believe, especially people that look at all [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3747.9s)]
*  the inequality and look at all the chaos and look at all the all the things [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3750.5s)]
*  that are wrong with this country. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3754.46s)]
*  And there's certainly a lot. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3756.3s)]
*  It's still the best place. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3757.62s)]
*  Agreed. Because it's the best place to communicate. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3759.46s)]
*  It's the best place to openly communicate. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3761.7s)]
*  That's why things like what we're talking about, like with FBI being embedded [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3763.9s)]
*  in Twitter, trying to suppress certain narratives, it's so dangerous [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3767.46s)]
*  because that's what leads you to communist China. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3770.98s)]
*  That's what when when the state has total control over the narrative [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3774.54s)]
*  and then the people that are involved in financing all that [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3778.58s)]
*  and profiting from all that are the ones that put these people in power [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3783.3s)]
*  and then control how the masses behave and think and communicate. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3787.2200000000003s)]
*  It's leading us down this slippery road. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3792.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's what scares the shit out of people. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3794.86s)]
*  And I think rightly so. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3796.9s)]
*  Agreed. Agreed. Yeah. I mean, I and. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3798.42s)]
*  And I think we also at the at the the same time, you know, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3802.82s)]
*  I think we need to be vigilant. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3807.1000000000004s)]
*  We need to we need to be educated. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3808.6200000000003s)]
*  We need to look into these things. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3811.1000000000004s)]
*  And I think we also need to not jump to conclusions. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3812.26s)]
*  And I think we need to be very cognizant about, you know, who we're listening to. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3814.46s)]
*  And, you know, honestly, you know, it's it's platforms like yours. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3820.0200000000004s)]
*  It's it's finding people that that we trust that we just know, OK, look, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3824.46s)]
*  this guy at least is telling his truth. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3828.38s)]
*  There's no agenda behind it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3829.86s)]
*  There's no they're not trying to convince you of anything. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3831.0600000000004s)]
*  It's it's so unbelievably vital to to to hang on to that [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3833.6600000000003s)]
*  and to know that people do have their hands in this information. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3838.38s)]
*  They don't do they have any kind of podcast like this in Russia? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3841.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, is that even possible? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3844.82s)]
*  I don't think so, man. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3845.9s)]
*  I mean, again, like I'm not, you know, I remember when I was there, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3846.86s)]
*  you know, there was the Moscow Times and, you know, there's the exile. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3850.86s)]
*  I know you've you've you've had. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3854.1800000000003s)]
*  The yeah, you know, it was it was. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3856.42s)]
*  There was there was this explosion of of free press [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3862.1400000000003s)]
*  and really like gonzo journalism over there, you know, and [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3866.38s)]
*  the the but I don't know, to be honest with you, man, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3870.5s)]
*  when I was there, I was a little bit sickened by the expat community. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3872.94s)]
*  You know, there was like there was a real [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3878.22s)]
*  there was a real sort of like hedonistic. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3883.38s)]
*  I mean, look, I think probably a lot of it was me being kind of self important [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3887.3s)]
*  and I was on this kind of like acting pilgrimage and I took myself super seriously. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3890.86s)]
*  But, you know, there's a lot of people that were going over there to, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3894.54s)]
*  you know, be with as many Russian women as they could. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3898.42s)]
*  And there's a lot of people going over there to sort of [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3900.7s)]
*  I felt pretty exploit that they were exploiting. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3904.46s)]
*  And and and, you know, I [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3908.22s)]
*  there was there was very distinct, different Moscos when I was there. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3912.7s)]
*  You know, there was the Western version of of Moscow, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3916.98s)]
*  which was just, you know, totally different. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3920.34s)]
*  And and and then there was, you know, for me, I just I [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3923.2599999999998s)]
*  what I think was so lucky is I was going to school with with with Russians, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3927.02s)]
*  you know, with with with people, you know, you'd have [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3930.54s)]
*  you'd have kids who would bring their entire families down [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3933.58s)]
*  from the mountains, from the Caucasus. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3937.02s)]
*  You'd have like nine people in a little apartment [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3939.1s)]
*  and the whole family would be like cooking on a hot pot [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3941.8199999999997s)]
*  because this one kid had this opportunity to go to school there. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3944.62s)]
*  And it was this like level of support and encouragement. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3947.46s)]
*  And, you know, the relationships that I formed, you know, with these people, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3949.98s)]
*  we grew up so wildly differently. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3953.66s)]
*  The connections were so beautiful. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3956.02s)]
*  And, you know, you had [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3958.86s)]
*  you know, I just I don't know. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3963.22s)]
*  I was just I was really lucky that I got to be in Russian in Moscow that way. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3965.62s)]
*  And and that's that's that's not an easy thing. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3969.86s)]
*  And I'm I'm I'm worried about whether that's even possible now. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3973.02s)]
*  Did you learn Russian? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3976.94s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, when I when I was there, especially playing baseball, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3978.22s)]
*  you know, none of those guys spoke any English. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3981.62s)]
*  I had a translator in school. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3983.54s)]
*  But yeah, I got all right. I got all right. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3985.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, one thing I've noticed that, you know, when I come home, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3987.18s)]
*  you know, when I'm around Russian people, I always try to speak a little [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3991.46s)]
*  little Russian and there's just this, you know, there's just this this. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3994.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know whether it's pride. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3997.74s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but I'll throw out a couple of words [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=3998.9s)]
*  and they'll just answer in English like, fuck you, motherfucker. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4001.38s)]
*  I learned your language. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4003.74s)]
*  I don't hear your fucking pig brushing. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4004.98s)]
*  Who do you think you are, motherfucker? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4007.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, like and and but, you know, like [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4009.1s)]
*  while you're there, like people, there are people that you knew spoke English [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4011.74s)]
*  and they would just would refuse to speak it over there. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4015.62s)]
*  It's like not going to happen. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4017.7s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4018.66s)]
*  Did you learn how to read it a little bit? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4019.7s)]
*  That was that that was harder. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4022.06s)]
*  I mean, like if I really, you know, take my time. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4023.46s)]
*  But I mean, you know, at that point, I could barely read English. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4026.18s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was just such an asshole. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4028.5s)]
*  I mean, I remember when I was there, you know, we'd have these things [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4029.74s)]
*  called Black Tuesday and and all the teachers. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4031.94s)]
*  Would you would come in and they would sort of tell you [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4036.66s)]
*  whether you could continue or not. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4038.7799999999997s)]
*  And they would kind of each break you down about like your strengths [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4040.7s)]
*  and your weaknesses. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4043.46s)]
*  And you would just see people just crying their fucking eyes, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4044.06s)]
*  like being devastated walking out of there. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4046.3799999999997s)]
*  And I remember, you know, I walked in there once and these teachers were like, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4048.74s)]
*  John, you're like, John, your talent is like a gem. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4053.3399999999997s)]
*  But they're like, you completely but it's completely unformed. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4057.7799999999997s)]
*  You lack any semblance of elegance. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4061.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, like they're saying this thing like push, you know, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4064.3399999999997s)]
*  like they're saying and then like you got the like you're waiting for like [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4067.06s)]
*  the shooter drop with the translator. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4069.54s)]
*  And then they're like, we bet you've never read a book. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4071.2599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, yep, gotcha. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4073.82s)]
*  I've never, you know, like bingo. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4075.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4077.7s)]
*  And then they're like, you know, from this moment on, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4078.58s)]
*  never, never let there be another day where you're not reading a book. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4080.66s)]
*  And I took them up on that. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4084.38s)]
*  You know, I took them up on that. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4086.42s)]
*  And she really, really was some of the best advice I ever got. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4088.1s)]
*  How do we shift that over here? Dude. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4091.22s)]
*  Got to read. Yeah, got to fucking read. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4094.18s)]
*  You got to take in other people's perspectives and work. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4096.74s)]
*  It's a vital part of being a human being. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4100.26s)]
*  And it takes a while for people to understand and read that or understand [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4103.94s)]
*  and, you know, take that in. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4107.42s)]
*  It's a it's so important for the human condition. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4109.86s)]
*  It's such an unbelievably available resource here in America. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4113.58s)]
*  And yet people would rather go on TikTok. That's right. It's. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4118.0199999999995s)]
*  It's such a hard thing to encourage, too, because it requires discipline. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4122.82s)]
*  And if you're not raised with discipline, if it's not a [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4125.98s)]
*  it's not incorporated into you very early, it's it takes a monumental shift [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4129.459999999999s)]
*  in the way you think about life to incorporate that. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4133.94s)]
*  How do you do that with your with your children? Well, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4137.099999999999s)]
*  fortunately, my kids have been around me when I've been, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4140.78s)]
*  you know, during the time that they're alive. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4145.9s)]
*  I've been at my most disciplined and most best, you know. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4148.94s)]
*  Thank God they weren't around me when I was 21. Right. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4153.099999999999s)]
*  You know, and they they're seeing the example of someone [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4155.62s)]
*  who works hard and works all the time and has a lot of discipline [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4158.82s)]
*  and also wants to talk to them about things. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4162.9400000000005s)]
*  And I want to talk to them about the value of difficult things [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4166.34s)]
*  and about failure and about like sports. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4170.58s)]
*  They're involved in sports, which I think are very important to kids. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4174.9400000000005s)]
*  You certainly can develop assholes through sports, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4178.26s)]
*  but I think there's something about winning and losing an effort [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4180.86s)]
*  and reward for that effort. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4184.3s)]
*  That's a vital part of being a human being. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4185.9800000000005s)]
*  And through that, through sports and through any difficult thing, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4188.9800000000005s)]
*  you develop your human potential. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4192.06s)]
*  I think you only find it through struggle. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4193.860000000001s)]
*  You only find it through a difficult thing to acquire [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4196.34s)]
*  or a difficult thing to accomplish. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4199.54s)]
*  And then doing that and recognizing that your boundaries are actually movable [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4201.1s)]
*  and that the boundaries that hold you back now are not permanent. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4205.46s)]
*  They're just they speak to your state at the moment. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4209.860000000001s)]
*  But that state, you can advance that state and you can you can do things [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4212.38s)]
*  to make your perspective more nuanced and enhance it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4216.9800000000005s)]
*  And and, you know, hopefully they can learn from that. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4220.9800000000005s)]
*  But there's also the problem that they're growing up in a loving household. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4223.9800000000005s)]
*  They're growing up, you know, the examples they have [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4227.38s)]
*  as people that are very kind and nice. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4229.78s)]
*  And I think you do need to be exposed to a certain amount of assholes [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4232.18s)]
*  to understand the full scope of human beings. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4236.3s)]
*  No question. And I feel I feel so much of [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4238.900000000001s)]
*  you know, you know, my job as a father is creating this kind of adversity [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4242.46s)]
*  in my kid's life. I have to. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4246.74s)]
*  And then I need my my my my children to learn the lessons that I've learned. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4248.22s)]
*  I just really can't have them learn it the way that I learned. Right. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4255.54s)]
*  Because that it could have not going away. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4259.06s)]
*  And most of the time, it doesn't go the way you went. That's right. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4262.42s)]
*  Yeah. It's like if you get 100 kids and you thrust them into horrible [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4266.06s)]
*  environments, very few of them come out to be this [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4269.5s)]
*  this person who has forged themselves through the fire of adversity. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4273.18s)]
*  Most people succumb. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4277.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think that's right. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4280.74s)]
*  And I and I think most people also don't have I mean, look, I mean, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4282.78s)]
*  through all the trouble and all the shit that I got into, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4286.5s)]
*  I had a loving, supporting family who had my back. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4288.7s)]
*  And I think that's when I when I think about the inequality in this country. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4291.26s)]
*  I mean, one of the main themes and what I'm trying to do with this podcast [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4295.26s)]
*  is just I've seen firsthand how the legal system, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4299.02s)]
*  how so many of the systems that are in place, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4302.620000000001s)]
*  people who don't have that infrastructure, it is so grossly fucking unfair. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4305.42s)]
*  And they don't have an example to go off of. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4309.9400000000005s)]
*  One of the things about human beings is we imitate our atmosphere. That's right. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4312.3s)]
*  And we become accustomed to seeing people work hard, achieve things [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4315.18s)]
*  and people that are kind and ethical and honest. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4318.540000000001s)]
*  And we look at that as like that's a value that I want to aspire to achieve. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4321.780000000001s)]
*  And if you don't have that around you and all you have around you [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4325.9400000000005s)]
*  is crime and drug ridden streets and gang violence. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4328.78s)]
*  And you don't know any other way to think or behave. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4332.66s)]
*  You don't you don't have an example of it. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4336.98s)]
*  And there's very little effort done to change those neighborhoods. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4339.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the amount of effort [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4343.259999999999s)]
*  and the amount of resources that we pump into other countries, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4345.0599999999995s)]
*  we pump into the military, pump into all these various things. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4347.94s)]
*  We always seem to have money for it. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4351.179999999999s)]
*  Imagine if you're a child and you're being raised in this community, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4353.42s)]
*  that it's essentially been the same way for decades and decades with no help. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4357.22s)]
*  That's right. That's very you feel like an outsider and you feel not. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4361.58s)]
*  You feel like the system is rigged in many ways. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4365.740000000001s)]
*  It is. I couldn't agree with that. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4368.62s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree with that more. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4370.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think, you know, in terms of in terms of our children, it's it's, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4372.62s)]
*  you know, how do you how do you get them to to see that? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4377.38s)]
*  Understand that experience it, experience it a little bit. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4383.06s)]
*  But but but but but but also, you know, understand those inequities [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4387.860000000001s)]
*  and and and and try to inspire them to to to do something about it. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4392.06s)]
*  And and and and I [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4396.66s)]
*  I think for me, it's it's just again, you know, we people talk about, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4399.1s)]
*  you know, like masculinity and you know, this this this term [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4403.900000000001s)]
*  that gets thrown around all the time, like this toxic masculinity [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4407.02s)]
*  and whatever the fuck that means. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4409.740000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I just think that, again, it's like, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4411.46s)]
*  what are the examples that we're putting forward? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4414.74s)]
*  And what are the examples of of of. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4417.26s)]
*  People, you know, as fathers, what what what kind of men [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4421.26s)]
*  are you surrounding yourself by? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4424.0599999999995s)]
*  What are the things that are important to you? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4425.66s)]
*  And I think it's it's not to me, at least it's it's not. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4427.58s)]
*  You know, some sort of rejection of these classically masculine traits. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4433.86s)]
*  I think that, you know, having the ability [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4438.179999999999s)]
*  and understanding you have the responsibility to keep your family safe [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4441.82s)]
*  is is is absolutely essential in being a man and in in providing. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4445.74s)]
*  I think having a healthy relationship with violence, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4451.94s)]
*  having an understanding of it, I think, you know, teaching your kids to [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4454.5s)]
*  to to have a relationship with violence where where where, you know, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4459.74s)]
*  they're not being ruled by fear or shame, but they can have some sort of [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4463.219999999999s)]
*  understanding, some sort of [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4466.179999999999s)]
*  some sort of, you know, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4469.139999999999s)]
*  they can touch it, they understand it a little bit. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4472.219999999999s)]
*  They know what they're doing. I think it's essential. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4474.0599999999995s)]
*  And I also think, you know, being accepting, being kind, being open, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4476.86s)]
*  you know, being generous, being empathetic are also [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4481.86s)]
*  you know, part of being a man. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4485.94s)]
*  And I think that, you know, oftentimes [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4487.219999999999s)]
*  because so many of the people, I think, who who [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4491.099999999999s)]
*  you know, kind of leading the charge on on [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4494.94s)]
*  and who have, you know, so much [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4498.139999999999s)]
*  sort of have so much of the platform at their disposal [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4501.82s)]
*  are kind of leading in these sort of toxic ways where it's all a bunch of [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4505.179999999999s)]
*  bomb, ass and bullshit. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4508.34s)]
*  And to me, you know, like it's been my experience, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4509.54s)]
*  you know, folks who really know what they're doing in that world [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4512.38s)]
*  really don't need to, you know, show off about it at all. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4517.58s)]
*  You know, the people that are high achievers, they don't really have to [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4521.099999999999s)]
*  beat their own chest and I think that's right. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4524.099999999999s)]
*  Blow their own horn. I think that's right. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4525.9s)]
*  Yeah. What we think of as toxic masculinity is really a bunch of losers. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4527.82s)]
*  So a lot of it is like the worst example. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4531.74s)]
*  But you could get the same. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4534.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, there's no term toxic femininity, right? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4535.62s)]
*  But there's there's toxic human beings and some of them happen to be male [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4538.34s)]
*  and some of them happen to be female. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4542.9s)]
*  But it's not an indictment on male. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4544.26s)]
*  You know, the male gender of the species. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4547.0599999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. Right. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4549.0599999999995s)]
*  And the idea that you don't need men, that somehow another like [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4550.42s)]
*  the female is the future. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4553.78s)]
*  It's like, what are you talking about? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4555.18s)]
*  That's crazy. You need a balance. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4556.34s)]
*  There's a yin and yang in this life for a reason. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4557.9s)]
*  That's right. All of it goes together. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4559.9s)]
*  That's right. Just everybody has to do better. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4561.74s)]
*  That's right. And I think that's something that I've really, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4563.54s)]
*  you know, go on this, this thing that I'm trying to do. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4566.94s)]
*  I'm really just trying to to put up examples of that men and women who, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4570.0199999999995s)]
*  again, really, really walk that walk and are not leading with sort of just, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4574.219999999999s)]
*  you know, and trying to give whatever platform I have to those kinds of [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4578.94s)]
*  people who are real examples of that. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4582.54s)]
*  What was your your big break as an actor? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4584.259999999999s)]
*  Do you think it was the Walking Dead? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4587.259999999999s)]
*  Was that was the big one? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4588.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4589.62s)]
*  You were fucking great in that. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4592.46s)]
*  Oh, thanks. You played such a good creep. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4593.7s)]
*  Such an asshole, right? Yeah. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4596.0199999999995s)]
*  But it was so believable, like all of it was so believable. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4597.86s)]
*  Thanks, man. It was really good. Thanks. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4600.78s)]
*  I mean, I think that it was the the for me, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4602.58s)]
*  it was the the perfect the perfect role, the perfect time in my life. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4607.0199999999995s)]
*  These things just like they really they really, you know, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4612.38s)]
*  married each other. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4617.34s)]
*  You know, I've been busting my ass for about 10 years before that [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4618.540000000001s)]
*  and just failing miserably. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4621.660000000001s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of people think that you just like, you know, that [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4623.9800000000005s)]
*  I've been doing it for a long time. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4627.14s)]
*  But I was still really a pretty big fuck up, Joe. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4629.5s)]
*  And and and I was hitting brick wall after brick wall in my life. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4632.14s)]
*  I was kind of a shitbag. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4638.900000000001s)]
*  I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't a good boyfriend. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4640.780000000001s)]
*  I was I was still, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4644.5s)]
*  you know, having having episodes of violence on the on the street, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4647.820000000001s)]
*  I was still getting into street fights, still getting into trouble. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4651.9800000000005s)]
*  I was drinking way too much. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4654.740000000001s)]
*  On July 3rd, 2009, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4658.02s)]
*  I was out, I lived in Venice Beach, and I every July 4th, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4662.26s)]
*  we had like a really big July 4th party. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4666.58s)]
*  And I was walking my dogs in Venice Beach and [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4669.38s)]
*  I I I stopped because I saw there's there's like a big house party. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4674.38s)]
*  It was this thing called First Fridays in Venice where people could drink on the street. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4678.9800000000005s)]
*  And I saw this older couple and they were playing the didgeridoo. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4682.26s)]
*  You know, the didgeridoo. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4686.42s)]
*  OK, so they're boy, that's pretty good. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4687.42s)]
*  And yes, so they were playing the didgeridoo and they were probably [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4690.740000000001s)]
*  like a couple in their 60s. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4693.5s)]
*  And I saw this one guy outside the party who's kind of like a ringleader. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4694.58s)]
*  He's dancing around drinking 40s. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4697.58s)]
*  You know, they're kind of like want to be tough guys. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4699.1s)]
*  And the guy went over to the woman who was playing the didgeridoo [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4701.06s)]
*  and he lifted it up and he like put it on his crotch. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4706.46s)]
*  So it looked like this old woman was like blowing his crotch. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4709.620000000001s)]
*  And I remember just like looking at her, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4713.900000000001s)]
*  her husband, and he was just like broken. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4717.46s)]
*  And like I saw this couple like they had to pack their stuff up. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4720.700000000001s)]
*  And it was just like, and I don't know, Joe, I like there's like something about that. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4723.740000000001s)]
*  Like I was drawn to it like I was supposed to see it that day. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4727.860000000001s)]
*  And I like saw red and like right at that point, that same guy, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4730.98s)]
*  he called my dog over. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4736.94s)]
*  My dogs are super well trained. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4739.099999999999s)]
*  And I walked them. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4740.7s)]
*  I didn't they weren't on their leash. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4742.139999999999s)]
*  And there's one dog named Boss, this great pit bull. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4743.9s)]
*  And he's oh, my gosh, look at that dog. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4746.42s)]
*  We're probably 50 yards away. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4748.66s)]
*  And he called the dog over and. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4749.98s)]
*  Boss went over to him and the guys like pet my dog [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4753.34s)]
*  and kind of like roughing up my dog a little bit, just kind of like manhandle him [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4755.9s)]
*  because he's a big pit bull, whatever it was. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4758.9s)]
*  And I called my dog back and the guy, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4760.42s)]
*  the guy held onto him and didn't let him come back to me. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4764.9400000000005s)]
*  And again, man, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4767.66s)]
*  some part of me wanted this to kind of happen, you know, and and and I went over [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4771.26s)]
*  to him and I grabbed my dog and I was like, boss, let's go. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4777.26s)]
*  And I pulled my dog away and he's like, hey, man, get off my dog. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4781.06s)]
*  And, you know, one thing kind of led to another. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4784.66s)]
*  But I started to walk away and him and a couple of his friends started to follow me [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4787.0199999999995s)]
*  and he pushed me in the back. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4790.419999999999s)]
*  And I turned around and I hit him with the right hand. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4793.419999999999s)]
*  And he got knocked out standing up and he fell down and he cracked his head on the pavement. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4796.54s)]
*  And his friends all kind of jumped on me. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4803.139999999999s)]
*  I tried to put my back against the tree and do what I could, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4806.259999999999s)]
*  but they started to get the better of me. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4808.74s)]
*  Police came and, you know, long story, fucking long, you know, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4811.58s)]
*  you don't look like like he wasn't waking up. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4817.219999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4819.7s)]
*  They're taking him away. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4823.94s)]
*  I was like sitting there handcuffed to the side. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4825.9s)]
*  Some friends of mine came, I got them to get my dogs out of there. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4828.7s)]
*  But, you know, I'm on the side with this police everywhere. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4831.299999999999s)]
*  People are like from that party, pouring beers on my head. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4833.259999999999s)]
*  And I'm just kind of sitting there. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4836.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they they took me down to Pacific Division. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4837.7s)]
*  And the guy still wasn't waking up. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4841.139999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I'd gotten in trouble in the past in Washington and, you know, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4843.820000000001s)]
*  that the police were just saying like, hey, man, like, you know, if he doesn't wake up, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4849.62s)]
*  that's that's that's that's kind of that. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4853.46s)]
*  And, you know, I was handcuffed to this bench in the Pacific Division. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4855.9400000000005s)]
*  And I remember just really having to take a piss. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4861.740000000001s)]
*  And, you know, nobody was letting me. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4864.3s)]
*  And they, you know, they were kind of giving me shit about, you know, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4866.62s)]
*  what's going to happen if this guy doesn't wake up. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4870.700000000001s)]
*  And I remember sitting there on that bench. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4873.22s)]
*  That, you know, if this guy doesn't wake up and I'm going in that direction now, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4877.740000000001s)]
*  I knew and it was as clear as any thought I've ever felt that I was going to have to sort of get in touch. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4884.66s)]
*  I was going to have to be the devil. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4892.780000000001s)]
*  I was going to have I was going that route. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4894.38s)]
*  All this acting shit, all this this friends and fun. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4896.54s)]
*  It's over. I got to go be the worst. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4899.62s)]
*  And most vicious part of myself if I'm going through that door. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4903.740000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't like something like trying to steal myself or act like I'm, you know, man, I'm nothing. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4907.54s)]
*  But I was I was as sure of anything that that's what needed to happen. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4912.02s)]
*  And it was clear and I wasn't scared. I just knew it. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4917.740000000001s)]
*  But then my next thought, I just looked up and I was like, but if you can just get me out of this. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4920.780000000001s)]
*  And I remember just saying it, if you can just get me out of this, I swear to you, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4928.38s)]
*  like I am done, like I am done and I will dedicate my life to my lady. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4933.18s)]
*  I will dedicate my life to my work and I will dedicate my life to you and I will dedicate my life to service. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4938.42s)]
*  Like I will dedicate my life. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4943.62s)]
*  And, you know, literally, man, I'm not trying to, you know, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4945.860000000001s)]
*  one second later, cop came by and said the guy woke up and. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4950.46s)]
*  You know. Man, that could have gone anyway. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4956.22s)]
*  And and I know, again, you asked me about Walking Dead, but literally one year after that, July 3rd, 2010, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4962.58s)]
*  I was on set of my first season of Walking Dead and not drinking, focused, engaged to be married, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4970.14s)]
*  had my first kid on season two. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4976.900000000001s)]
*  And. And again, man. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4981.34s)]
*  You know, I'm. I'm I'm like so profoundly [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4985.18s)]
*  like humbled by that and grateful for that, like so grateful for it. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4990.66s)]
*  But I'm also like aware of like how unfair it is that so many people don't get that shot [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=4996.379999999999s)]
*  and it doesn't work out that way. And but yeah, you know, like getting to [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5002.54s)]
*  then kind of play a role like that, that had a real beginning, middle and end kind of like built in. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5009.5s)]
*  You know, it was an and at a time in my life where I just totally stripped all the fat out of my life, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5016.38s)]
*  the people I was hanging out with, the way I was behaving, I got ridiculously disciplined [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5023.06s)]
*  pretty much about every part of my life. And. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5028.1s)]
*  Yeah, so it was so yeah, I'm sorry, it's such a grandiose answer, but it's it's Walking Dead. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5032.900000000001s)]
*  But it was also that time at Walking Dead and the people that I was around and what that what that all meant. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5038.66s)]
*  But yeah, it was, you know, my life completely, completely and utterly changed. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5043.3s)]
*  And I think the sad thing is, man, it's not like that was the first time that happened. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5048.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I had so many times where I should have learned that lesson so many times. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5051.860000000001s)]
*  And because I had some wiggle room, because I had people looking out for me, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5056.5s)]
*  because I came from a family with a father who was engaged and, you know, had the means and [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5059.02s)]
*  the ability to help me out. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5066.02s)]
*  And that is so, you know, vastly unfair. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5068.26s)]
*  And it's a reason why now, I mean, it's like on the show, it's like, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5071.5s)]
*  well, why we're hanging out and spending time with so many people in this [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5075.1s)]
*  LWOP community with a life without parole community in prison. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5079.78s)]
*  And these guys who, you know, like me, I fucked up, you know, made a horrible mistake, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5083.18s)]
*  did something did something without a doubt inexcusable. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5088.58s)]
*  But you talk to some of these guys and they have this fluency with their shame, this fluency. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5094.26s)]
*  With they've spent so much time living in in in their. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5101.54s)]
*  In in in the vileness of what they've done. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5107.7s)]
*  That they they they they they they this they've spent so much time [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5111.7s)]
*  like empathizing and and putting themselves in their victims shoes. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5117.58s)]
*  But they are different people 20 years later than the crime that they committed. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5125.66s)]
*  And their entire life now is dedicated to service. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5131.0599999999995s)]
*  It's dedicated, you know, this LWOP community in Calipatria prison that we hang out with. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5135.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, they've really changed so much of the culture in that prison. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5140.139999999999s)]
*  That was one of the most violent prisons in all of the state of California. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5143.38s)]
*  And California prisons are notoriously violent in this community. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5146.94s)]
*  They broke down the racial walls. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5151.18s)]
*  You know, they're this this LWOP community, this group, these these guys who basically [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5154.42s)]
*  have a living death sentence. They've all banded together. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5158.22s)]
*  It used to be, you know, you're you're in a different car. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5161.42s)]
*  Like you're in a different race. You can't even talk to each other. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5163.5s)]
*  But these guys, this multiracial group of men have gotten together and they provide support for each other. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5166.38s)]
*  They have programming. They have hope. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5172.38s)]
*  My friend, Brett May, you know, who's been on the show, he's a paralegal now. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5175.46s)]
*  He's gotten his degrees. You know, he was part of the felony murder rule. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5179.34s)]
*  You know, he was part of a home invasion where someone was murdered and he didn't pull the trigger. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5182.5s)]
*  But he was there and got life without parole. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5187.06s)]
*  And, you know, when you when you when when you talk to him, when you talk to him about [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5190.700000000001s)]
*  how much time he has spent thinking about the horror that those people must have felt when they woke up and knew he was in the home [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5199.34s)]
*  and how just utterly disgusted and ashamed he is. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5206.9800000000005s)]
*  Look, I'm not I'm not advocating to forgive him. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5210.22s)]
*  I'm not advocating that anybody should free him. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5215.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm not advocating. But I am advocating that we can learn from him and that we should listen to him. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5218.459999999999s)]
*  And and he's such a dedicated father. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5224.259999999999s)]
*  And and and he's he's he puts all his life now into helping other people who are coming in with this sentence [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5229.94s)]
*  that, you know, if you go into prison and you have that sentence, what are you going to do? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5237.7s)]
*  I mean, what are you going to do? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5242.259999999999s)]
*  There's no reason not to there's no reason not to engage in violent behavior. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5243.5s)]
*  There's no reason not to try to put money in your you and your family's pocket that way. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5247.18s)]
*  And he goes right to those people and he leads them to a better place. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5251.34s)]
*  I'm a huge believer that only people that really have been in that valley, you know, can lift others out of it. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5254.74s)]
*  You know, and I'm deeply inspired by him, man. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5261.82s)]
*  Deeply inspired. That's wild. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5265.860000000001s)]
*  That's it's so true what you're saying about there's moments in your life where things could have tipped one way or the other. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5268.66s)]
*  And that's a giant percentage of the people that are locked up. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5275.98s)]
*  But they could have had an opportunity to turn their life around, but there was nothing there for them. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5279.58s)]
*  And they didn't have the infrastructure, the people around them or the power, the money or, you know, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5286.46s)]
*  they've been generations of people that that that that that had been held down. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5291.86s)]
*  And, you know, it's real. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5296.54s)]
*  And, you know, we we had. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5299.34s)]
*  We had a guy on a. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5307.06s)]
*  Couple of weeks ago, Richard McKinney, he's a he's a man who he was Murray and he forced recon and he was he was overseas during 9-11. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5309.46s)]
*  And he developed this, like, unbelievable hatred for Muslims. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5321.98s)]
*  And he he there's a beautiful documentary coming out called Stranger at the Gate. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5326.94s)]
*  That's that's that's about his life. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5333.1s)]
*  And so he you know, even the guys in his unit were like, hey, man, you got you got to come down with that shit. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5335.5s)]
*  And then believe he got injured and then he came home from Muncie, Indiana. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5341.5s)]
*  And he just had this unbelievable hatred of Muslims. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5346.0199999999995s)]
*  And it just ran kind of everything in his life. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5350.0199999999995s)]
*  And at the same time, the Muslim community in Muncie was growing. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5353.38s)]
*  There's this wonderful woman who worked at the created something called the Muncie Islamic Center. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5357.66s)]
*  And she's this woman who's bringing in. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5363.7s)]
*  She brought in over one hundred and fifty seven Muslim refugees into America. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5365.9s)]
*  And he was seeing more and more Muslims in the community. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5371.98s)]
*  It was driving him crazy. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5374.5s)]
*  So he devised a plan to go and blow up the mosque and he was going to blow up this Islamic Center. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5376.7s)]
*  He built a bomb. He he he worked on the plan for over two years and walked in, built a bomb, walked into the center. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5381.9s)]
*  And when he walked in there, he was met by that woman, Bibi. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5391.86s)]
*  And she greeted him in this way that he had never seen before. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5396.86s)]
*  And. She invited him, she gave him a Quran and he really wanted to read it. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5401.0199999999995s)]
*  He really wanted he thought that he was going to find proof in this Quran that that that that that that all these people just wanted, you know, Americans dead. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5408.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's just what his mindset was. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5416.0599999999995s)]
*  So he felt like he had sort of won. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5417.82s)]
*  So he decided to leave that day and come back still with this plan to blow up the Islamic Center on a Friday where there would be 200 people there. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5418.98s)]
*  Then the woman invited him into her home and cooked for him. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5425.74s)]
*  Now, years later, he's a devout Muslim. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5431.0199999999995s)]
*  He's the president of the Islamic Center. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5433.219999999999s)]
*  Whoa. They are like family. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5435.74s)]
*  And I had both of them on the on the podcast. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5437.98s)]
*  Man, it's it's a whole shit. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5441.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And and and. I don't know, man. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5443.5s)]
*  It's just like we're we're we're so we were so ready to say, you know, fuck you. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5446.5s)]
*  We're so ready to just slam the door on people. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5453.459999999999s)]
*  And I don't know. Look, man, you started the conversation. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5456.219999999999s)]
*  You know, some of your favorite people in your life are people really fucked up when they're young. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5460.42s)]
*  You know, I don't know, man. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5464.18s)]
*  I think you your your capacity for going in that valley again is directly relative to your capacity to lifting others out of it. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5466.14s)]
*  And your capacity to create havoc directly relates to your capacity to create good and connection and growth. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5476.14s)]
*  And I really I really believe that, you know, this is amazing that one person who is of [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5483.740000000001s)]
*  considerable character and love can change the way that guy thinks about things. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5489.82s)]
*  I'll tell you, sit down with her and brother in like two seconds. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5496.259999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh, wait, you're magic. Like you're you know, she's just one of those people. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5499.78s)]
*  And I asked her she would she would have him in her home and she would cook for him. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5503.299999999999s)]
*  She's a wonderful cook. She'd have these huge meals. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5509.42s)]
*  And I asked him, when you walked into her home, when you ate her food, were you still planning on blowing her up and her family? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5512.299999999999s)]
*  And he said, absolutely. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5518.5s)]
*  And I asked her, knowing that now, if you had known that then, like, how would you feel? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5520.3s)]
*  And she said, look, without missing a beat, I still would have had him in my home, still would have had him in my home. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5526.18s)]
*  And that's my that's my job. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5530.18s)]
*  That's my job. That's my duty. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5532.34s)]
*  Wow. Holy shit. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5533.58s)]
*  It's crazy. That's nuts. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5536.86s)]
*  But it's real. Like when you see that when you see them together, it's not there's like nothing put on. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5539.66s)]
*  There's nothing, you know, that he's not like, you know, it's so easily sort of dismiss people as bonkers or like it. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5544.0199999999995s)]
*  But but, you know. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5551.78s)]
*  It's very easy to write people off, but even people that are capable of great evil are also capable of great love. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5555.5s)]
*  It's just people people are oftentimes a victim of the thoughts that bounce around their own mind and of circumstance and of [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5563.7s)]
*  momentum. It's crazy how one moment of meeting one person starts a totally different path in this guy's life. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5572.7s)]
*  That's right. Wow. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5583.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So you go from this horrific moment where you might be locked up in jail for manslaughter for the rest of your life. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5584.98s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, a year later, you're on The Walking Dead. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5595.099999999999s)]
*  You're on this, which, by the way, that first season, I think The Walking Dead kind of lost its way later on. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5598.18s)]
*  I stopped watching it when it became like murder porn. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5604.06s)]
*  But the early seasons, especially like season one, God damn, was that a good show? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5607.54s)]
*  I mean, it just captivated the the minds of people like because it was so obviously it's fiction and it's you know, it's a horror movie, horror show. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5613.42s)]
*  But it so speaks to the human condition when confronted with adversity and horrific circumstances. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5624.9s)]
*  What happens when you strip off the veneer of comfort that dictates so much of our behavior every day. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5630.7s)]
*  And, you know, it's really cool for me specifically to kind of play this character who is the first one that was kind of onto it. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5638.78s)]
*  The first one that was like, you know, these rules, they don't apply anymore in this world. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5646.18s)]
*  And you can you know, you can. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5650.22s)]
*  And look, I think I think for me as just a performer, you know, all the way around, man, is there was a wildness. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5651.820000000001s)]
*  There was a recklessness that I really sought after just kind of in my life and in my own behavior that that I was really kind of addicted to. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5660.740000000001s)]
*  But it always led me to really kind of horrible ends. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5671.46s)]
*  And I was a real big fuck up. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5675.62s)]
*  And but I found something with with this where I could take all of that and put it into work. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5677.1s)]
*  Yeah. And it man, it's been that's my sword. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5684.34s)]
*  Depth of that character comes from. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5687.62s)]
*  Right. I mean, that's that's the advantage that you have of having all those fuck ups. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5690.42s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think so. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5696.5s)]
*  And the advantage of, you know, I also think I'd be curious to hear what you thought about it. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5698.94s)]
*  But I, you know, you know, now, you know, you you are who you are. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5705.82s)]
*  It's like your intentionality. I think intentionality is so important. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5711.179999999999s)]
*  You know, like, where are you when you begin? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5715.139999999999s)]
*  Like, what is what is your goal? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5717.62s)]
*  Like, why did you start this thing in the first place and always kind of going back to that and to keep yourself honest? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5719.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, when The Walking Dead started, there was no craft service. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5728.099999999999s)]
*  There was no trade was like a bunch of us in the fucking woods. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5731.5s)]
*  It was like Frank Darabont. He had done Shawshank Redemption. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5733.42s)]
*  He had tried to get the show on HBO. They said no. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5736.42s)]
*  AMC had like Mad Men and Breaking Bad. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5739.42s)]
*  They're like, all right, we'll do your shitty little zombie show. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5741.54s)]
*  We'll pick it up for six episodes, which basically means we don't really believe in this thing at all. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5743.74s)]
*  You know, and but he got these group of people together and it was so humble and everybody. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5748.66s)]
*  And the thing that's crazy about like a zombie show and about like living in a different world like that, there are rules. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5754.9s)]
*  Right. So if you put a bunch of actors in the woods and you have six people walking through the woods and if you make any noise, the zombies could come. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5762.5s)]
*  If one fucking actor is sitting there thinking about, OK, like, do I look cool here or how's my makeup? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5769.22s)]
*  Or if one person isn't fully committed, you literally shit on the entire thing. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5774.22s)]
*  Like the reality of that world is totally screwed. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5779.46s)]
*  And it just it was sort of this like perfect storm of people that were young and hungry and committed. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5782.46s)]
*  You had a bunch of people who are just starting families. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5787.66s)]
*  So there wasn't you know, there's no like going to bars or restaurants or any of that bullshit. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5790.38s)]
*  It was just really, really gratitude. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5794.22s)]
*  So lucky to be here. Let's make this work. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5796.82s)]
*  Who gives a fuck if it's six episodes or 12. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5798.66s)]
*  Let's just make this work. We all believed in Frank. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5800.86s)]
*  And, you know, there's something really to that, to the intentionality behind it. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5803.46s)]
*  And, you know, I think that's often something not a baseball coach who once said, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5807.7s)]
*  you know, when you're at bat and things start spiraling out of control and, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5813.78s)]
*  you know, baseball is such a heady sport. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5817.46s)]
*  And, you know, when you start all of a sudden, you start getting in your head [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5820.139999999999s)]
*  and you start going down that spiral, you need to step out. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5824.22s)]
*  And he would say, remember why you did it in the first place. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5827.78s)]
*  Like, remember why you wanted to play baseball in the first place. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5830.139999999999s)]
*  Go back to the time when you were a kid, when you just fucking loved it and like go there. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5832.66s)]
*  And as long as it takes, just go there, then step back in the batter's box. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5836.42s)]
*  And I really I. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5839.86s)]
*  I'm asking myself that a lot now, you know, because there's a lot, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5842.78s)]
*  you know, how the conversation started doing this podcast with me. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5846.9s)]
*  Where, you know, I'm like, why am I doing this? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5850.9s)]
*  Like, what, you know, and I keep on having to go back to that thing because it does, man. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5853.02s)]
*  It comes it comes with the cost, and especially as the thing grows. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5857.58s)]
*  But I keep going back to it's it's the people that I have on. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5862.82s)]
*  It's the people that I have on. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5867.74s)]
*  They're the people I want my kids listening to. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5868.7s)]
*  Well, you're doing an amazing job with it. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5871.219999999999s)]
*  And I think having these crazy life experiences [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5873.0599999999995s)]
*  and these journeys that you've gone on your own mind, it really works well because of that, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5877.259999999999s)]
*  because you're very charitable and you're very compassionate. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5883.099999999999s)]
*  And it comes through. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5886.74s)]
*  It's very obvious that you have a [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5888.0199999999995s)]
*  a more balanced view of what human beings are capable of than the average person. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5891.74s)]
*  But, you know, I appreciate you saying that, man. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5897.74s)]
*  I think I think I think mostly. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5899.82s)]
*  You know, I just kind of I just kind of shut the fuck up. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5905.339999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, I know that I'm not bringing on people that I don't know. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5908.259999999999s)]
*  I know them, and we have really, really close relationships. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5911.74s)]
*  So it's you know, it's it's it's special forces soldiers and and and and fighters and and surgeons and teachers. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5915.5s)]
*  It's you know, they come from all but but every person. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5924.22s)]
*  Within their own community, it's not just that they have this job, it's like I know them. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5928.22s)]
*  I know how respected they are in their own community. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5933.58s)]
*  I know how much they've given me. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5935.86s)]
*  I know how much they've added to my life, how much value they put in. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5937.3s)]
*  And again, it was coming in this vacuum when I just really saw fuck, man, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5941.14s)]
*  we were listening to the wrong people. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5944.42s)]
*  Everyone's just like spouting out all this bullshit like these people know, man. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5946.34s)]
*  These people know. And and I'm not saying, hey, they're the end all. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5950.1s)]
*  But on this subject, they've been there. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5954.34s)]
*  I promise you that they've really been there. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5956.02s)]
*  And, yeah, I think it comes also just in the way that I work as an actor. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5958.42s)]
*  And, you know, the greatest thing about what I get to do is I get to go and. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5964.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, we go to Fury and we get to talk to, you know, guys who are really in tanks in World War Two. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5972.34s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's like not that many of those. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5978.02s)]
*  Those guys are the best among us. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5980.06s)]
*  You know, I got to, you know, we you know, Kevin Vance. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5983.1s)]
*  It's where I met Kevin Vance, you know, Navy SEAL, just beautiful, beautiful man who's just taught. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5987.46s)]
*  He's had such a deep impact on my life. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5993.26s)]
*  And and, you know, you know, actors, we. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=5996.66s)]
*  That to me is everything. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6001.02s)]
*  And it fucks me up sometimes because I'm actually way less interested in, you know, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6002.46s)]
*  like what the director or the producer kind of think about what I'm doing. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6006.580000000001s)]
*  I'm just on those people and that opportunity to to learn from those folks. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6009.700000000001s)]
*  You know, you have somebody, whether you're a vet or a police officer or anything, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6015.18s)]
*  you open up to somebody, you bring them into your world like that sacred man. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6021.780000000001s)]
*  That's that's that's that's that's a trust that I really, really, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6026.18s)]
*  I really value and really mean something to me. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6030.62s)]
*  And it's again, it's my sword in work like that, that it gives you a North star in this [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6037.02s)]
*  in this kind of malleable, weird thing where you've got so many different agendas [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6042.700000000001s)]
*  that play and what people kind of want. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6047.22s)]
*  You know, a film is super collaborative and everybody, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6048.780000000001s)]
*  everybody's got their own kind of agendas there. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6051.9800000000005s)]
*  But but but you know, if you can find some truth, it's like, man, just just just go try [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6053.98s)]
*  to do that, you know, learn that trade, learn how to handle that weapon, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6058.099999999999s)]
*  learn how to coach that tennis, you know, like, you know, learn that shit. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6061.0599999999995s)]
*  It's it's that's that's busy work that you can actually do. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6064.78s)]
*  You can if you put the time in, you can actually achieve something. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6069.139999999999s)]
*  It's not just, hey, man, let's hope for the best. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6072.459999999999s)]
*  I'll get it on the next take. Fuck that. I can't. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6074.0199999999995s)]
*  I just I don't I wish I could. I just I don't have the stomach for that. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6076.0199999999995s)]
*  What do you want to do with your show? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6079.5s)]
*  I mean, your show has picked up all this momentum. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6081.219999999999s)]
*  Your podcast, it's it's really gotten to a point where you have a big audience now [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6083.78s)]
*  and a lot of people are listening into it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6089.46s)]
*  Do you have a goal? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6091.62s)]
*  Do you did you anticipate it growing to where it is now? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6093.38s)]
*  Like, what did when you first started doing it, did you just do it? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6096.62s)]
*  Say, I just feel like this is something I'm compelled. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6099.9s)]
*  And then we'll see where it goes. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6102.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm working with a group of people that I really believe in. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6103.9s)]
*  There's a there's a group of, you know, young filmmakers and and and [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6106.86s)]
*  podcasters that that that I really believe I think they share the ethos of the show. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6111.06s)]
*  No, man, I I [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6117.860000000001s)]
*  you know, I think what the goal is and what we're really trying to do [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6120.14s)]
*  is give a platform to the folks that come on. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6125.58s)]
*  And I don't mean on my show. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6128.820000000001s)]
*  So what we're trying to do like that fishing show that I mentioned, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6129.9800000000005s)]
*  my friend Kevin Vance is now going to go do a show where he's going around [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6132.46s)]
*  and he's talking to he's talking to special forces. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6136.58s)]
*  He's talking to members of the community that he really knows [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6141.3s)]
*  and help them deal with issues that they're dealing with. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6143.86s)]
*  We've got, you know, another show like like I told you about [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6146.54s)]
*  with the readings that we're putting on with Sloss and Rec. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6149.9800000000005s)]
*  So, I mean, ultimately, what I'm trying to do, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6153.18s)]
*  you know, there's the Silverback Chronicles, which are two [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6156.58s)]
*  career police officers in Baltimore that we had on their part. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6159.74s)]
*  They're they're a group of cops in Baltimore called the Silverbacks [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6162.78s)]
*  are a bunch of all black cops, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6165.62s)]
*  a unit there that are just totally policing for the right reasons. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6169.22s)]
*  Respect to the community. They're no nonsense. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6173.0599999999995s)]
*  They've got an amazing podcast sort of about just, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6175.3s)]
*  you know, the streets of Baltimore. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6178.98s)]
*  And you're involved in all these shows. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6180.42s)]
*  Yeah. So our job is to give them the infrastructure. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6181.7s)]
*  And our job is to promote and help all of these different things. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6184.58s)]
*  My friend essentially like running a network. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6187.5s)]
*  You know, that's what the guys that I that's the word that, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6189.66s)]
*  you know, the guys that I'm working with keep using. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6192.5s)]
*  I mean, one thing about me, Joe, and it's probably the one area in my life. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6194.42s)]
*  I remain just enormously sloppy. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6198.78s)]
*  I'm not a businessman. I'm just not. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6201.7s)]
*  I don't know how to really think that way. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6203.7s)]
*  You know, I ultimately, you know, I. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6208.26s)]
*  Ultimately, supporting these folks and and giving them this platform [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6213.1s)]
*  and then providing them that infrastructure that I can get behind and believe in. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6218.900000000001s)]
*  And as long as as long as people [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6223.5s)]
*  are still coming to us and wanting to come on and and and and [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6227.94s)]
*  there's people that I that I'm really interested in speaking with. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6233.219999999999s)]
*  I'm I'm going to keep doing it. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6236.38s)]
*  But it's hard, you know, I go to do a role. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6238.78s)]
*  And for better or worse, I kind of have to shut down, man. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6241.9s)]
*  I really do. And I'm not. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6244.62s)]
*  I'm kind of disgusted by by actors who just talk about the process all the time. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6248.299999999999s)]
*  And it's really not my bag. It's really not something. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6252.26s)]
*  But but for me, there is a necessity to. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6256.3s)]
*  It's the only way I know how to work is to kind of push everything else out. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6262.1s)]
*  So, you know, I can't do this while I'm doing that. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6266.42s)]
*  So it's a really hard thing to navigate. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6269.900000000001s)]
*  You know, it's a really hard thing to navigate. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6271.860000000001s)]
*  But what made you decide it was that the people you're working with [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6274.820000000001s)]
*  that decided to do all these additional shows as well? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6277.74s)]
*  Yeah. And I thought I wanted to be more than just giving these folks a voice. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6281.18s)]
*  I want to, you know, my my my Sebastian Richardson. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6285.26s)]
*  People called him Bam Bam on the street from Shreveport, Louisiana. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6289.54s)]
*  Shreveport's I wrote a show about about Shreveport. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6293.780000000001s)]
*  I've been going down there for about 10 years. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6297.26s)]
*  Bam Bam was in Supermax at Florence, Colorado. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6299.780000000001s)]
*  He was in prison with Larry Hoover, with El Chapo. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6303.06s)]
*  You know, he he was part of a he's part of a [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6306.18s)]
*  a Rico case in Shreveport in this little neighborhood called the Bottoms. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6309.66s)]
*  Sort of legendary street guy [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6312.82s)]
*  who was extraordinarily violent in prison, ended up in Supermax. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6316.860000000001s)]
*  And people don't get out of Supermax. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6322.3s)]
*  He's part of the Marshall Project. He was tortured in prison. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6324.66s)]
*  He was basically blinded there. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6326.9800000000005s)]
*  They kept him zip tied for, I believe, 253 days. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6328.7s)]
*  His skin started to grow over the zip ties because he was basically protesting [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6331.9400000000005s)]
*  how other prisoners were being treated. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6335.22s)]
*  So to get him out of his cell to eat every day, he would just welcome it. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6337.38s)]
*  They basically gas him and beat him every single day. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6340.66s)]
*  He ended up getting out. Now he's minister. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6343.860000000001s)]
*  It's an unbelievable guy. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6346.820000000001s)]
*  He's dedicating his entire life now to [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6348.26s)]
*  to the young community of Shreveport, a city that's just ravaged [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6353.26s)]
*  by gun violence right now. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6357.1s)]
*  And he's got a podcast. So we're supporting that. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6358.740000000001s)]
*  We're supporting his merchandise. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6361.66s)]
*  You know, there's so much in that community. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6364.099999999999s)]
*  We've done a bunch of, you know, we go to the place. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6366.78s)]
*  We don't have them come to us. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6369.419999999999s)]
*  So we've done a bunch of shows in Shreveport. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6371.58s)]
*  You know, I again, it's these stories, I think, are really worth being told. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6375.5s)]
*  You know, my friend, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6380.66s)]
*  my friend Alfred Brown, people used to call him Goat. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6383.98s)]
*  He was kind of he was a guy who who ran this community. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6386.66s)]
*  It was kind of I don't I don't love the word, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6389.54s)]
*  but he's sort of a gang leader down in Shreveport in Louisiana [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6392.02s)]
*  in this community called the Bottoms and got got busted on RICO charges. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6395.700000000001s)]

*  He's lost two of his daughters to gun violence since he's been out. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6403.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, Goats, a kind of guy, they call him Goat. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6409.18s)]
*  He's he's the kind of guy that, you know, back in the day, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6412.3s)]
*  you know, he could he could [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6416.38s)]
*  have you taken off the face of the earth like really easily. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6420.3s)]
*  Now, when this young man. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6423.82s)]
*  Killed his daughter, he testified on behalf of him [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6426.900000000001s)]
*  and said, putting putting another black boy in prison is not going to bring [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6430.82s)]
*  my daughter back. I open up my home to you. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6433.58s)]

*  I want to show you that there's a better way. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6437.54s)]
*  And again, that level of forgiveness, that level of empathy, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6439.74s)]
*  that level of rehabilitation, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6443.74s)]
*  the potential that guys like Bam Bam and Goat and Big Don [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6446.66s)]
*  Reg, these guys down in the Bottoms, their commitment [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6450.86s)]
*  to changing this cycle. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6454.66s)]
*  It's it's beautiful, man. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6457.22s)]
*  It's everything I believe in. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6458.66s)]
*  And I've learned so much from these guys so much. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6460.0599999999995s)]
*  And I've also learned so much from Carl Townley, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6463.22s)]
*  who's the police officer that brought all these guys down. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6467.0599999999995s)]
*  And I've sat the two of them down together. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6469.58s)]
*  And they have so much respect for each other. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6471.66s)]
*  You know, and and and they're just they're all just really, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6474.9s)]
*  really good friends of mine. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6478.66s)]
*  You know, I love them all. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6480.5s)]
*  And some crazy it is, man, it really is. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6481.62s)]
*  And what's crazy about it, Joe, honestly, is like even like I've [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6484.14s)]
*  I had my little brother on. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6486.7s)]
*  I've had all these people on it. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6488.3s)]
*  I. You know, that's not [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6490.1s)]
*  I hate asking people to come on. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6493.74s)]
*  That part of is that that part of it is like, I think the worst. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6496.26s)]
*  I just I hate asking people to come on that. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6500.18s)]
*  That was like. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6502.78s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6506.5s)]
*  I think a lot of the folks that I have come on have never been on. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6507.219999999999s)]
*  You know, we shoot we shoot it with cameras like, you know, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6512.099999999999s)]
*  they've never been on camera before. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6514.46s)]
*  They're talking about things that are highly, highly sensitive. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6515.74s)]
*  They're they're they're going to places that are pretty dark [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6519.54s)]
*  to a person, everybody. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6524.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's been it's been a good experience. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6525.3s)]
*  But that that's just a it's a that's a real hard thing for me. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6528.42s)]
*  I don't like I don't like, you know, asking that of my friends. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6531.82s)]
*  It just you don't like asking because you don't think they would enjoy it. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6537.7s)]
*  Or do you think you're putting them on the spot? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6542.219999999999s)]
*  You're putting them in a in a compromising position? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6544.179999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think I'm I think more the the [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6547.099999999999s)]
*  the second thing you said that that I. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6550.86s)]
*  I know that with a lot of these folks, it's it's just really hard [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6554.38s)]
*  to talk about a lot of this stuff and and and it's really [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6557.42s)]
*  you know, and and. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6562.82s)]
*  I never. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6566.74s)]
*  I never want to feel like I'm [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6569.46s)]
*  burdening them, yeah, or taking something from them and using them [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6572.46s)]
*  and in some sort of way. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6575.46s)]
*  And then again, you got to go back to that intentionality. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6577.299999999999s)]
*  You got to step out of the batter box and you got to say, OK, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6579.42s)]
*  what are you doing this for? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6581.58s)]
*  And then you remind yourself, you know, what is their experience after it's done? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6582.82s)]
*  Are they happy about it? Yeah, yeah, it's it's been across the board. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6587.62s)]
*  I mean, the only people you know, we do it a little bit differently. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6591.66s)]
*  You know, like I. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6594.5s)]
*  Since I've done, you know, I've been a part of so many interviews as an actor. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6596.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, you're always you know, there's all these forces that play [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6601.82s)]
*  where you got to be like careful about what you say, which I just find [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6604.82s)]
*  just so ridiculous and so much the antithesis of being an artist. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6607.1s)]
*  And you know, so I say to everybody that comes on, hey, man, we're going to [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6610.3s)]
*  we're going to give you the episode and anything that you want out, it will take out, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6614.9800000000005s)]
*  you know. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6618.219999999999s)]
*  And the only people that have sort of given me a hard time about that is actors. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6620.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, obviously, you know, it's after talking about nothing. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6624.339999999999s)]
*  That's like at all bad at all. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6628.66s)]
*  But you know, but I get it. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6630.5s)]
*  It's you know, I try not to judge. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6632.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing what some people are sensitive about. Yeah. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6634.86s)]
*  But it's great, though, that most people, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6638.7s)]
*  the majority of people are having a good experience from it. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6641.82s)]
*  So it's coming through what you're trying to accomplish is coming through. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6644.9800000000005s)]
*  It's been wild for me, you know, like, you know, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6648.1s)]
*  Bo and Jerry, like they're like, we want to start a fishing show. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6651.740000000001s)]
*  We're like, fuck yeah, let's go. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6654.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? And and there's been so [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6655.66s)]
*  there's been so much of that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6658.740000000001s)]
*  And I really do think there is this cathartic, not just cathartic, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6660.06s)]
*  but there's just this human need to tell your story. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6663.820000000001s)]
*  And I think these folks for so long have felt shit. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6665.820000000001s)]
*  Man, I'm on the front lines of this shit. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6668.42s)]
*  Like, I'm on the front lines of this shit. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6670.26s)]
*  And I got to listen to these assholes spouting off like they know about [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6671.58s)]
*  policing or they know what it's like to come from a community like this [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6675.9s)]
*  or they know what it's like. Like, I know. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6678.78s)]
*  And and and and and you know, to a person, it's been it's yeah, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6680.82s)]
*  it's been it's been wildly positive for people who are doing it [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6685.74s)]
*  kind of for the first time. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6688.86s)]
*  And yeah, I'm real. I'm I love that. I love that. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6690.34s)]
*  It's awesome that you're expanding this thing. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6694.14s)]
*  Like you started it kind of on a whim. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6697.9s)]
*  And now it's kind of growing and expanding almost like it's a force of its own. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6700.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like it, you know, it kind of it kind of has to be, you know, I [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6704.42s)]
*  you know, we had we had George Christie on the other day, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6711.099999999999s)]
*  who's he was the longest serving president of the Hells Angels. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6715.9s)]
*  He was the president of the Los Angeles chapter. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6720.299999999999s)]
*  And then he started Ventura. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6723.259999999999s)]
*  And he's got this he's got this one man show [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6725.3s)]
*  that he wants to put on that I just can't wait to to see. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6729.7s)]
*  You know, I don't know. I'm just so you know, I really do. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6732.74s)]
*  I don't mean to get all kumbaya on you, man. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6735.62s)]
*  But I really do believe there's something about art and performance [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6737.62s)]
*  that is you can really take. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6742.02s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like what I was saying, you know, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6745.860000000001s)]
*  on a much smaller level with me and my own bullshit. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6747.860000000001s)]
*  You know, you can you can take all this stuff that tells you down [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6750.54s)]
*  that maybe you've caused pain to people. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6753.66s)]
*  You hurt people. You fucked up or you disappointed your family, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6755.82s)]
*  whatever it is, disappoint yourself. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6758.9s)]
*  You you're an awful member. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6760.98s)]
*  So you can you can use all that fuel. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6762.54s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. Yeah, it's fuel. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6764.5s)]
*  And you can use it to go reach people. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6766.22s)]
*  The pain that you felt is a real adhesive. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6768.54s)]
*  And you can you can latch on to them and they can see, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6771.38s)]
*  you know, shit, man, I've been there like I, you know, I've been there. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6774.5s)]
*  And maybe, maybe you can stop them from making that huge mistake themselves. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6778.94s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6783.86s)]
*  And like, they're certainly not going to listen to. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6784.9s)]
*  They're not going to listen. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6786.74s)]
*  You know, the punisher, they're not going to listen to my dumbass being like, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6787.78s)]
*  hey, you really shouldn't do, you know, but hey, man, here's a guy [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6790.219999999999s)]
*  who just went down 30 years. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6792.98s)]
*  He's coming out of supermax. He's been where you were. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6794.259999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, one of one of the shows we had, we had, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6796.82s)]
*  you know, a father and son and the father was in that life. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6800.42s)]
*  And now the son is. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6803.339999999999s)]
*  And they were just talking about like what that felt like, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6804.74s)]
*  what that felt like to, you know, have the police say [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6807.18s)]
*  when he was one years old, you're never going to see your son again. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6809.9400000000005s)]
*  And now that this young man, you know, he's got he's got a little baby girl, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6812.42s)]
*  you know, and she wants, you know, and it's like, you know, by talking about it [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6816.22s)]
*  and then maybe potentially putting that out into your own sort of creative [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6819.54s)]
*  forum, you know, your own creative [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6824.820000000001s)]
*  expression, you know, maybe, you know, maybe that will [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6828.38s)]
*  maybe that will, you know, be an on mission, you know, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6832.06s)]
*  maybe that will do something. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6834.66s)]
*  Well, it certainly has the potential. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6836.46s)]
*  And it's there's there's certainly a door open for good [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6838.58s)]
*  and a door open to give people a chance. Potentially. Yeah. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6842.46s)]
*  That's it's a well, that's where it all comes from, right? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6846.82s)]
*  That potentially that word potentially that's hope. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6850.26s)]
*  You know, that's something that's that's a window of opportunity [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6853.9400000000005s)]
*  that didn't exist previously. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6857.82s)]
*  And I think through this intention that you have and through this [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6859.62s)]
*  very charitable view of human beings that you have, you're projecting that. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6864.42s)]
*  And you've got to think of the hundreds of thousands of people [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6868.86s)]
*  that have watched that and taken that in. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6872.5s)]
*  And then they can incorporate a piece of that in their own life, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6874.58s)]
*  like inspiration through things like that is so vital. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6876.78s)]
*  It's so important for people to see how a person can make these [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6880.94s)]
*  charitable decisions and make these these, you know, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6885.58s)]
*  views of people in the best possible light and give them an example [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6889.42s)]
*  or give them an opportunity to to show their best best possible self. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6893.58s)]
*  It's so huge, man. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6898.42s)]
*  It's like it's one of the things that's missing in mainstream culture. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6899.7s)]
*  You know, our our culture in terms of the way we learn about information [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6904.5s)]
*  and stories is so polarizing and it's just looking for bad people. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6908.22s)]
*  It's looking for evil things or looking for propaganda [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6912.98s)]
*  to pretend that people that are doing evil things are actually good. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6917.86s)]
*  It's it's an amazing thing you're doing. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6921.74s)]
*  It really is. I think it's fucking beautiful. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6924.7s)]
*  I really appreciate you saying that, man. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6926.62s)]
*  I mean, and look, I mean, you know, not just throw it back your way, man. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6928.42s)]
*  But if you look at, you know, this and this incredible, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6932.42s)]
*  monumental, unprecedented thing that you've built, I mean, I think, you know, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6937.26s)]
*  yes, it's it's it's deeply entertaining, but you're also like, I don't know, man. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6941.74s)]
*  I did this desire to [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6945.7s)]
*  to get to get better, to to to to find new avenues, to be curious, to to to dig in. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6950.14s)]
*  I mean, that's that's to me, that's that's really what this this show is. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6956.34s)]
*  And it's, you know, and for me, it's one of the most hopeful things [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6960.740000000001s)]
*  I think about our culture right now, that this now has become such a stall. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6964.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's the biggest thing in the world, you know, and and and and I just, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6969.740000000001s)]
*  you know, it's it's enormously it's enormously inspiring. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6974.3s)]
*  And, you know, pretty surreal just to be here. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6977.9s)]
*  Well, thank you. I appreciate it. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6981.179999999999s)]
*  It freaks me out a bit. It's surreal. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6982.42s)]
*  How do you prepare, man? I really am interested in that. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6984.9s)]
*  Like, it depends on the person. OK. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6987.5s)]
*  Can you give me some examples? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6989.259999999999s)]
*  Well, for you, I'm a fan of your work and I'm a fan of what you've done [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6990.179999999999s)]
*  with your podcast, so I kind of just wanted to talk to you. OK. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6994.58s)]
*  So there wasn't much preparation with you. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=6998.099999999999s)]
*  I just was like, this guy's cool as fuck. I want to sit down. OK. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7000.179999999999s)]
*  With other people, like with certain scientists or certain people [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7003.94s)]
*  that are dealing with human rights situations, I want to get an understanding [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7007.74s)]
*  of the scope of the problem that they're addressing and what they've been able to do. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7012.34s)]
*  Like I had this guy, Siddhartha Kara, on the other day, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7015.94s)]
*  who is exposing cobalt mining in the Congo. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7019.78s)]
*  And it was probably the heaviest podcast I've ever done. Wow. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7024.82s)]
*  It's it's so intense because it's such. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7028.26s)]
*  An insane problem. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7032.099999999999s)]
*  It's such an insane problem that powers all the electronic devices that we use, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7034.1s)]
*  including electric cars. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7038.860000000001s)]
*  And it's all essentially coming from slaves. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7040.5s)]
*  At the bottom of the supply chain is the poorest people on earth [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7043.900000000001s)]
*  with no electricity breathing in toxic fumes because they're banging [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7049.58s)]
*  cobalt out of these mines with hammers while they have babies on their backs. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7054.58s)]
*  It's so heavy. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7059.660000000001s)]
*  It's the heaviest podcast I've ever done. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7062.42s)]
*  But by far, like words like you're choking back emotions and tears [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7064.540000000001s)]
*  while I'm listening to him talk and I'm trying to figure out how do I [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7070.540000000001s)]
*  how do I steer this? What do I you know, what do I say next? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7075.14s)]
*  How do I how do I react to this? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7077.780000000001s)]
*  What do I you know, what more information can I extract from him? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7079.540000000001s)]
*  And he's just such a deeply committed person that has spent [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7083.540000000001s)]
*  years of his life researching this and risked his life exposing this. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7089.74s)]
*  And I was really aware of this, first of all, through Coltan, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7095.099999999999s)]
*  which is the first thing that I was aware that they extracted from the Congo [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7099.86s)]
*  through the stuff that the early days of Vice when they worked on it. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7104.78s)]
*  And that was when I was first exposed to it, that this is such a huge issue. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7109.82s)]
*  But I had no idea the scope of it until I started researching this [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7113.54s)]
*  in regards to that that podcast. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7117.98s)]
*  And that's one that was heavy. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7120.14s)]
*  You know, that's one that requires a lot of thinking about the problem [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7122.3s)]
*  and a lot of like looking at what it's actually like there. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7126.82s)]
*  And these people that have this is this is what it looks like. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7130.5s)]
*  This is a cobalt mine in the Congo. Holy shit. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7134.14s)]
*  And, you know, the narrative by these electronics companies [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7137.26s)]
*  like Samsung and Apple is that they get everything through ethical sources. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7141.06s)]
*  Like you can hear the hammers clinking. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7145.06s)]
*  So with every hammer that's clinking, they're extracting cobalt [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7147.38s)]
*  and also inhaling this poison dust. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7151.900000000001s)]
*  It's poisoned their environment, poisoned the rivers, poisoned all the land. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7155.22s)]
*  It's horrific. They live without electricity. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7159.66s)]
*  They barely make enough money for food. There's no education. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7162.66s)]
*  There's no hope. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7165.5s)]
*  And everything is being guarded by commandos who are trying to make sure [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7166.62s)]
*  that the public doesn't ever find this out, because at the end of this [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7170.66s)]
*  is the most ethical and moral and progressive companies like Apple, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7175.06s)]
*  which is so crazy, hypocrite, filled with hypocrisy. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7181.1s)]
*  It's so disturbing that that's the reality of the world we live in, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7186.02s)]
*  that if you have one of these somewhere, a slave contributed to it. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7190.14s)]
*  There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. There's no way around it. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7196.620000000001s)]
*  It's impossible to get ethically sourced cobalt for these phones. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7200.259999999999s)]
*  And cobalt is integral to the way the heat management, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7205.94s)]
*  the way the batteries work. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7210.099999999999s)]
*  It's fucked like beyond fucked. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7213.82s)]
*  And people are trying to hide this information, including the people [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7216.86s)]
*  that are running these enormous corporations. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7220.7s)]
*  They have to be aware of it. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7222.86s)]
*  Tim Cook has to know about this. There's no way he does it. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7224.419999999999s)]
*  And these people are reaping in immense profits. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7227.7s)]
*  How did he get like how did how did he get that information? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7231.06s)]
*  Like, how did he get that footage? [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7234.26s)]
*  He went there. He got that footage with his own phone. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7235.86s)]
*  That's his phone that took that footage. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7238.9800000000005s)]
*  He went there and risked his life and he had people that were sympathetic [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7241.26s)]
*  to the cause that that got him in and got him the proper paperwork. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7244.26s)]
*  And, you know, they had guns pointed to his head, roughed up by thugs, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7248.34s)]
*  thinking this is the end. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7252.86s)]
*  And luckily got through all of it. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7254.46s)]
*  But barely. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7256.9s)]
*  And the stories that he tells about that journey and what it's like [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7258.46s)]
*  and the passion in his. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7261.62s)]
*  The passion in his message to to try to get this out to people, [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7264.86s)]
*  to try to illuminate this problem and to try to shed light on the situation [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7269.66s)]
*  is unprecedented. It's a. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7274.82s)]
*  I mean, just an incredible person, just an amazing person [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7277.74s)]
*  that has that sort of dedication to try to get that out. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7281.9s)]
*  And this is a guy that's also worked previously on human trafficking. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7285.54s)]
*  That was some other things that he exposed in his previous work. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7290.1s)]
*  So he's been dedicated to trying to shed life on these horrific situations [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7293.22s)]
*  in the world for decades. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7298.62s)]
*  God bless him. Yeah, God bless him. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7300.74s)]
*  Wow. Heavy. Yeah. Heavy. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7302.58s)]
*  Wow. You know, so that's how I prepare. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7306.3s)]
*  Depends entirely on the person with the comedian. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7308.18s)]
*  There's no preparation at all. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7310.26s)]
*  Like, maybe I'll listen to their podcast with fighters. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7311.58s)]
*  It's pretty easy because I'm a gigantic fan. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7314.06s)]
*  And generally, when I have someone on, I'm very, very aware of their resume [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7317.02s)]
*  and what you've done. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7321.620000000001s)]
*  So that's how I do it. It just depends on the person. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7323.780000000001s)]
*  And what about your what about your level of enjoyment? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7326.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, are there does it feel are there times where it feels like a slog? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7330.02s)]
*  Are there times when when are there times when you're not into it? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7333.9400000000005s)]
*  Are there times when you're extraordinarily excited about someone? [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7337.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, imagine runs a gamut or do you try to keep it? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7341.38s)]
*  Is there something that you do to sort of have a steady and healthy approach to it? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7344.18s)]
*  Well, hopefully, I know enough about the person's ability to communicate [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7348.3s)]
*  that it's not going to be a slog. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7354.18s)]
*  And there's very few slogs. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7355.66s)]
*  But I've had a few where I took a chance on authors and had them come in. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7357.34s)]
*  And unfortunately, they talk the same way they write, where, you know, people write. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7361.38s)]
*  They're very deliberate and slow. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7365.38s)]
*  And sometimes people talk deliberate. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7367.26s)]
*  So that's brutal. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7368.9s)]
*  Because like as a listen, it's very hard to follow along. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7370.219999999999s)]
*  And so I'm trying to like pick up the pace, trying to do something [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7372.9s)]
*  aware of my own attention span and try to just juice it up and keep it going. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7375.94s)]
*  And is your is your are you in that moment? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7379.98s)]
*  Are you like are you thinking about the audience? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7382.139999999999s)]
*  Are you thinking about you in the moment? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7384.58s)]
*  Like, fuck, this is miserable, miserable. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7385.98s)]
*  I'm like, if it's miserable for me, it has to be miserable for other people [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7388.42s)]
*  because I'm here. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7391.58s)]
*  I'm looking in this person's eyes. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7393.179999999999s)]
*  And also, I'm curious about what they're talking about. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7395.7s)]
*  So I wanted to bring them in here because I have a personal interest [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7398.34s)]
*  in whatever this subject is. Sure. Yeah. Sure. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7401.42s)]
*  But most people, it's not, you know, one weird question [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7404.34s)]
*  that people always ask is like, who's your favorite guest or who is a person [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7407.02s)]
*  that you would want to get on the most? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7410.3s)]
*  And I have the same answer. There's no one. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7411.5s)]
*  I don't have a favorite guest and I don't have a person that I want to get on. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7413.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, I'm happy to talk to you as I'm happy to talk to Tim [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7416.7s)]
*  Dillon or Joey Diaz or whoever the fuck it is. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7421.06s)]
*  Like, you know, what Muhammad Bilal, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7424.78s)]
*  comedians, fighters, Neil deGrasse Tyson, whoever it is. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7427.42s)]
*  I'm happy to talk to people. I like talking to people. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7431.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's I'm very fascinated by human beings. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7433.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fascinated by the wide variety of thought processes [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7436.58s)]
*  and life experiences and the way people view the world. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7441.54s)]
*  And through this thing, I've had an, you know, an accidental education, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7444.54s)]
*  like a deep accidental education on so many different subjects, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7450.58s)]
*  because I started it out with my friend Brian. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7454.54s)]
*  We were just smoking weed on a laptop, you know, just like [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7457.06s)]
*  just being silly and having fun. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7460.94s)]
*  We thought it'd be a fun thing to do. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7462.38s)]
*  And then slowly it started gathering momentum and steam [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7464.38s)]
*  and started getting guests. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7467.98s)]
*  And then it became what it is now. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7469.38s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a lot of is accidental. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7471.46s)]
*  You know, which is real weird. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7475.14s)]
*  I bet. I bet. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7477.46s)]
*  It was so it sent me a video of Times Square today. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7480.14s)]
*  There's this gigantic LED or LCD, whatever it is, liquid crystal display, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7482.7s)]
*  huge JRE video that's playing in the middle of Times Square. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7488.7s)]
*  You know, it's like fucking 50 feet high or something. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7493.94s)]
*  And I'm looking at that thing. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7496.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, that is insane. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7497.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That came out of a laptop in my office. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7499.46s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking around and having comedians come over [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7503.7s)]
*  and do hits out of this volcano vaporizer. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7506.78s)]
*  Yeah. And get so obliterated. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7510.82s)]
*  We literally didn't even know what we were talking about while we were talking. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7512.34s)]
*  Just having fun with no pretense and no thought whatsoever. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7515.38s)]
*  That one day this is going to be the biggest media platform in the world. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7520.54s)]
*  If I ever said that to them back then, they would have fucking laughed to my face. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7525.54s)]
*  They thought I was an idiot even for doing it. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7529.82s)]
*  Like, why are you wasting your time? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7531.860000000001s)]
*  You go from doing TV shows and standup comedy to this stupid shit. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7533.78s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7538.06s)]
*  And I didn't have an answer. Wow. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7539.7s)]
*  I don't know. I didn't like I don't know what I'm doing. It's fun. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7541.26s)]
*  Just keep doing it. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7543.42s)]
*  That's a trip, man. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7545.22s)]
*  And I think about, you know, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7546.38s)]
*  just the enormous amount of just people talking about you out there. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7549.66s)]
*  And, you know, like just your idea of like, you know, posting and ghosting [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7554.42s)]
*  and just like not and just just not being involved in it and just staying out of it. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7558.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that, too, I think, you know, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7563.9800000000005s)]
*  for me, when I have the mask, you know, when I have the [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7568.06s)]
*  the armor of going out there as a character, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7571.66s)]
*  you know, man, I'm like, fucking I'll go I'll do anything. Right. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7575.9400000000005s)]
*  I will fucking do it. And I always, you know, I'm not interested [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7579.18s)]
*  in anything safe. I'm like, you know, my acting style is like I want to create as much [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7583.54s)]
*  danger and I want to I want it to be wild and I want it to be unexpected. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7589.860000000001s)]
*  And my only way of judging whether we had a good day of work [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7594.74s)]
*  is whether like I completely, you know, created havoc on set [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7598.9s)]
*  and that it was electric and just like like I live for that shit. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7603.219999999999s)]
*  And so I always want to go as far as I can. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7606.46s)]
*  And the the process, the movies that I've been a part of [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7609.0599999999995s)]
*  or the shows that I've been a part of, where I've been able to push that envelope [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7612.379999999999s)]
*  to scare people, scare myself, surprise myself, tap into that wildness. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7615.099999999999s)]
*  That's how I that's my only sort of barometer of success. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7619.7s)]
*  But now, you know, like going out there with this, again, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7624.78s)]
*  with no aspirations of of of it even going out there, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7627.7s)]
*  you know, which is which is very fucking weird for the first time. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7631.46s)]
*  You know, getting real, real blowback, like real. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7635.099999999999s)]
*  You know, and what kind of blowback? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7639.46s)]
*  Oh, man. You know, like so much, you know, you know, I think that, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7641.7s)]
*  you know, look, when we I had Shia LaBeouf on, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7647.099999999999s)]
*  you know, after these allegations came out of him and [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7651.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7657.26s)]
*  being physically and emotionally abusive to to his to his girlfriend at the time. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7660.14s)]
*  And, you know, it was crazy was I never wanted to have any actors on. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7665.22s)]
*  That was kind of like my rule, just because and not because there's just so many [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7668.9400000000005s)]
*  podcasts where actors are talking to actors and they're they're talking about. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7673.06s)]
*  And I'm actually interested in that shit. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7676.42s)]
*  But like, you know, like nobody needs to hear me talk about that. Right. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7678.46s)]
*  But Shia, at the time, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7682.1s)]
*  you know, he he was a guy that, you know, when we did Fury together, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7687.1s)]
*  you know, that was such a wild experience. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7694.14s)]
*  And, you know, he you know, he was this guy who came in, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7697.3s)]
*  he like pulled his tooth out because he thought his character shouldn't have a tooth. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7700.5s)]
*  You know, he like cut his his his face, you know, he didn't shower for eight months. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7704.58s)]
*  And at first, when I met him, I was like, this guy is just fucking [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7708.74s)]
*  he's just loud, you know, he's just he's he's he's he's wearing his process [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7711.900000000001s)]
*  on his sleeve, showing everybody how hard he's working. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7716.34s)]
*  But what I found, you know, after the eight months of working with him [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7720.26s)]
*  was somebody who and I, you know, and this is it's just my own. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7726.02s)]
*  And he is every bit. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7729.78s)]
*  This thing is every bit as vital to him as it was with me. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7732.42s)]
*  I found a real partner. I found a real kindred spirit. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7735.42s)]
*  I found that he was so fucking cute. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7738.42s)]
*  He was he was willing to risk it all for for for for this for the work. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7740.78s)]
*  And I walked away with an enormous amount of respect for him and love for him. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7745.26s)]
*  I also saw a guy who grew up as a child star, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7750.9800000000005s)]
*  a guy who was felt like he needed to bleed out for his art, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7754.42s)]
*  felt that he needed to live wildly out on the street and in real life [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7759.42s)]
*  in order to sort of maintain that danger in his work. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7762.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm coming from a guy, you know, me at this point, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7766.38s)]
*  where I did all that when I I didn't have the umbrella of being, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7770.7s)]
*  you know, a big movie star and I didn't I didn't have that. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7773.9s)]
*  But now I'm a guy who's absolutely a committed husband and father. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7777.46s)]
*  That that is my life like that, like my life is my family. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7782.259999999999s)]
*  And and what I found is the the well, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7785.5s)]
*  the things that I can tap into in my emotional sort of accessibility [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7788.66s)]
*  of being a dedicated father and and and husband [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7792.0199999999995s)]
*  is so much greater than when I was sort of this wild animal. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7796.339999999999s)]
*  And and I care about people way more than I care about myself. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7799.98s)]
*  My ego is dead in that in that sense. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7803.82s)]
*  So I really wanted to be there for him. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7806.66s)]
*  And the first thing I remember seeing him and seeing this like raw nerve [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7810.82s)]
*  and this unbelievable talent, I I would say I think he's the best actor [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7814.38s)]
*  I've ever worked with. And. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7818.94s)]
*  I really wanted to protect him, and I think more than anything else, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7821.78s)]
*  I really wanted to show him what a real friend was like. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7824.66s)]
*  I just remember like saying that to myself, I want to show you [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7828.46s)]
*  what a real friend is like. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7830.86s)]
*  I feel like you've never really had a real friend. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7831.78s)]
*  And my friends, the guys that I grew up with, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7835.179999999999s)]
*  they've been my best friends my whole life. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7838.74s)]
*  They, you know, they, you know, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7840.42s)]
*  couldn't do anything without him. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7844.38s)]
*  I just like I value that so much. Right. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7845.46s)]
*  So we had him on the podcast real early on. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7848.62s)]
*  And before this stuff came out, and it was right at a time [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7852.139999999999s)]
*  when he had gotten in trouble down in in Georgia. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7856.099999999999s)]
*  And he went to rehab and he wrote this movie sort of about his own life [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7859.74s)]
*  called Honey Boy that got nominated for an Oscar. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7862.54s)]
*  And he wrote it and he started he played his dad. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7865.26s)]
*  It was a very movie about his life. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7867.98s)]
*  And I kind of had him on sort of celebrating, [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7870.38s)]
*  you know, where he was at, because for a long time, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7873.7s)]
*  he had taken a lot of shit from this industry. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7876.62s)]
*  And here he was sort of on top of the world. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7879.0599999999995s)]
*  And I remember at the time, you know, my my agents at the time [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7882.219999999999s)]
*  were calling me being like, you think I could just get a phone call with Shia? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7884.78s)]
*  Like, maybe we could like bring him, you know, just [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7887.82s)]
*  he was like, you know, and then these these these chart, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7889.74s)]
*  you know, this this woman said he did these things to him. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7894.94s)]
*  And he was just he was just done, you know, canceled. And and. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7897.54s)]
*  And I'll say, man, when when I heard those, I decide when I heard that [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7904.7s)]
*  that he had done those things, you know, for me, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7907.86s)]
*  there really is a red line with people that I need to look at with myself. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7910.74s)]
*  And through all the shit that I've seen, all the shit that I've done, man, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7914.62s)]
*  I just I can't be down with you if you put your hands on a woman. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7918.26s)]
*  If you put your hands on a woman or a child, dude, I just like, you know, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7921.900000000001s)]
*  I can't, man, I can't, I can't. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7925.46s)]
*  I can't get over that. I can't. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7928.22s)]
*  And I heard this, you know, about my friend and. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7930.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I was really brokenhearted about it and. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7936.14s)]
*  Time went by like two years and. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7941.1s)]
*  You know, I know how much, you know, acting is not only important to him, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7944.820000000001s)]
*  but like sort of necessary for his survival. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7949.06s)]
*  And I would reach out on text, you know, checking on him and that. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7951.34s)]
*  But we hadn't made contact. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7955.18s)]
*  And then I heard that he was having a baby [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7958.06s)]
*  and he was married and I reached out to him and. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7961.42s)]
*  I said, hey, maybe it's time for you and me to have another talk. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7967.740000000001s)]
*  And I made a decision with my team and with him. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7971.139999999999s)]
*  We're I needed again, you go back to the intentionality. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7973.82s)]
*  And I really looked at this, this role that you have of being a friend [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7979.7s)]
*  and being a friend is not about turning your back on somebody when they're [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7985.179999999999s)]
*  when they do something that you find fucking deplorable or when you find [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7990.419999999999s)]
*  disgusting, your job as a friend is to make sure they don't do it again. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7993.9s)]
*  Your job as a friend is to make sure they don't do it again. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7997.38s)]
*  And your job now as this guy's being a father is to step in there and say, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=7999.9800000000005s)]
*  hey, man, where are you at? [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8004.46s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? What kind of work are you doing? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8006.02s)]
*  Where are you? Like, that's what being a friend is. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8007.9800000000005s)]
*  And everybody in my life is like the worst idea in the world. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8011.14s)]
*  You cannot do that. You cannot do that. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8016.1s)]
*  And then, you know, he came on, man, and and [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8022.74s)]
*  and we spoke and. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8026.46s)]
*  You know, I. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8030.58s)]
*  It was weird because I found so many of the same themes [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8033.1s)]
*  and so many of the same the heart of what I found in that [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8037.66s)]
*  LWOP community, I found in Shia, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8041.58s)]
*  the level of disgust, the level of work, the level of commitment, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8045.34s)]
*  the level of shame, the level of time spent. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8048.06s)]
*  And I felt that I had this fluency with with with his victim. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8053.66s)]
*  And I wasn't I had no interest in exonerating him or saying [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8061.5s)]
*  or saving him in any way. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8066.5s)]
*  I wanted to check on him and I want to see how he was doing. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8067.86s)]
*  And I felt that that was an honest thing. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8070.46s)]
*  And. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8073.5s)]
*  You know, just the fact that I had him on, I got, you know, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8075.9s)]
*  an enormous amount of of backlash, you know, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8078.94s)]
*  really the first time kind of as like a public person, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8081.82s)]
*  just like kind of hatred. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8084.139999999999s)]
*  And the fact that I had given somebody. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8087.86s)]
*  Who could have, you know, who may have done these things [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8092.0599999999995s)]
*  that this woman says. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8094.54s)]
*  You know, that that really hurt people. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8098.259999999999s)]
*  And I felt fucking terrible about that, man, like like. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8100.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you wish you hadn't done it? No, no, because after talking to him [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8103.82s)]
*  and then going around and. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8108.98s)]
*  Talking to women who have been victims [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8111.98s)]
*  himself, talking to, you know, this one one woman specifically [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8115.0599999999995s)]
*  who we were going to have on, but. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8118.219999999999s)]
*  Her. She had health issues and couldn't, but. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8120.58s)]
*  You know what? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8126.0599999999995s)]
*  What I've found is so many people have reached out [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8126.98s)]
*  who said, like, I was in that place, like I like I was in that place [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8129.54s)]
*  where he was, I was in that place. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8133.9s)]
*  Where I was, whether I was abusive or not abusive, I was getting there. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8137.0599999999995s)]
*  And the drugs and the alcohol were getting the better of me. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8140.1s)]
*  And I mean, really, you know, he's. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8142.820000000001s)]
*  He was two years sober at the time that I had him on and. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8146.38s)]
*  And I thought really what it was was like a real meditation and shame, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8151.660000000001s)]
*  you know, and I thought that, you know, what this woman said to me was, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8156.5s)]
*  you know, with all there's so many places and platforms for. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8160.54s)]
*  Women to go to their shelters, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8167.42s)]
*  there's places to go to to talk about the abuse, to be there, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8169.18s)]
*  to help people after the fact. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8172.54s)]
*  But who is talking to these fucked up [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8174.42s)]
*  young men who are committing the abuse, who is talking to them and saying, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8177.700000000001s)]
*  Dude, don't do that. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8180.900000000001s)]
*  Like, I've been there. There is another way. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8182.06s)]
*  This is not the answer. Stop. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8183.820000000001s)]
*  Go get help. Change your behavior. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8185.22s)]
*  Work. Put in the work. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8187.9400000000005s)]
*  I just, you know, I ultimately felt, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8192.86s)]
*  you know, that that that what he said [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8197.66s)]
*  could have a real positive effect. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8201.18s)]
*  And I believe looking back on it now again, man, it's like, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8202.980000000001s)]
*  you know, what are you going to do? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8206.86s)]
*  You can weigh the comments of people. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8207.54s)]
*  I've told you, you know, the worst guy on earth for doing it. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8212.140000000001s)]
*  Or you can weigh the comments of the people say, hey, man, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8214.980000000001s)]
*  that thing saved my life. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8217.460000000001s)]
*  Or, you know, I mean, I can't look at it that way. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8218.62s)]
*  I look at the intentionality behind what the show was [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8222.140000000001s)]
*  and why I why I why I decided to have him on [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8225.9s)]
*  and then why I decided to air it. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8228.78s)]
*  And I stand by it. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8230.78s)]
*  Well, good for you. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8232.42s)]
*  And, you know, uncomfortable conversations with people [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8233.5s)]
*  where you think that what they did is horrific. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8236.82s)]
*  There's still important conversations. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8240.66s)]
*  It's it's a part of being a human being, [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8242.38s)]
*  just like having these people that have committed murder [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8245.34s)]
*  and have gone to jail and have been drug runners and criminals [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8248.26s)]
*  and having conversations with them about their journey. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8251.9s)]
*  And about retribution, about their emerging from this [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8255.54s)]
*  and become a better person. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8261.060000000001s)]
*  All of that is important. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8262.820000000002s)]
*  And I think I don't know, man, I don't know how you feel about this, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8263.94s)]
*  but I often I'm not sure exactly how to articulate it, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8266.62s)]
*  but sometimes the the tenor or the the the quality of kind of like [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8270.660000000002s)]
*  the threat or the punishment. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8275.580000000002s)]
*  Kind of tells you all you need to know. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8278.26s)]
*  And let me try to explain what I'm saying. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8281.18s)]
*  All these people that were saying, you know, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8283.98s)]
*  definitely don't have him on, definitely don't. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8285.9s)]
*  You know, the same people that before, you know, we're saying like, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8287.699999999999s)]
*  hey, just get me a meeting with him, you know, are now saying [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8293.1s)]
*  stay away from him at all costs. Right. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8295.34s)]
*  And and but without listening to him or what he sort of has to say. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8297.18s)]
*  And the same people that were sort of applauding [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8301.98s)]
*  and getting behind the fact that we're giving a voice to folks [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8305.5s)]
*  who have murdered, like you said, who committed murder, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8309.22s)]
*  who have who have gotten to these, you know, have engaged in super [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8311.380000000001s)]
*  serious criminality and talking openly and honestly about it. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8315.66s)]
*  Yeah. You know, they're sort of applauding that. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8318.58s)]
*  But they're saying stay away from this. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8320.94s)]
*  Yeah. And so it was clearly like, you know, the reason to stay away from it, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8322.7s)]
*  the reason to ignore it, you know, would would have been what to, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8327.06s)]
*  you know, career, career safety, you know, like I can't, you know, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8332.98s)]
*  that's not right. Right. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8336.82s)]
*  You know, like if you know, what kind of message is that to you, to your kids? [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8338.1s)]
*  I had a conversation with my friend Brian Simpson yesterday, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8342.98s)]
*  who's a standup comic, brilliant guy. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8345.5s)]
*  And one of the things we talked about was Will Smith slapping Chris Rock. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8348.42s)]
*  Chris Rock, who's in our world is, you know, he's one of the Mount Rushmore. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8354.699999999999s)]
*  He's a king. And, you know, [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8359.06s)]
*  his take on it was like that guy, fuck that guy forever. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8363.9s)]
*  And, you know, what do you what do you do with that guy? [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8369.1s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of us in the beginning were like, fuck that guy, fuck you forever. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8370.74s)]
*  And I'm like, no, you know, now thinking about Mike, that guy has to be forgiven. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8376.22s)]
*  Like, he clearly has deep remorse for what he's done. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8379.94s)]
*  And he's also clearly living in a world where he was given nothing [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8384.539999999999s)]
*  but adulation and praise for most of his life. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8388.9s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, he has this one, in many people's eyes, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8392.26s)]
*  unforgivable moment where he does something just so fucking stupid. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8397.54s)]
*  But it's not like he doesn't realize it. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8401.62s)]
*  He's a human being. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8403.9s)]
*  You just got to forgive him. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8406.02s)]
*  You know, and I think the real person who has to forgive him if he wants to is Chris Rock. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8408.42s)]
*  That's right. You know, and I don't know if Chris will, you know, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8412.66s)]
*  I haven't even talked to Chris about it. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8416.380000000001s)]
*  I haven't even talked to Chris about it. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8418.34s)]
*  You know, last time I saw Chris, it didn't come up at all. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8420.539999999999s)]
*  We talked about how Chris is on a renaissance of his stand up right now. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8423.179999999998s)]
*  His stand up has never been better. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8429.3s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8430.66s)]
*  Everybody that saw him said, like, dude, he's on fire. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8432.699999999999s)]
*  It's like old school. Bring the pain, Chris Rock. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8435.859999999999s)]
*  And I think it's because he got awoken to what he got into this for in the beginning. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8438.699999999999s)]
*  A lot for a lot of comics. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8444.58s)]
*  Being able to host the Oscars is like you're not just in. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8446.3s)]
*  You're in with the most important crowd possible. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8450.42s)]
*  You are not just one of the greatest comics of all time, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8455.099999999999s)]
*  but you're also the guy that can host the Oscars. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8457.699999999999s)]
*  And it's just like this. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8459.66s)]
*  Unachievable honor that such a small handful get to get to that spot. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8462.58s)]
*  And he got to that spot and was humiliated. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8469.539999999999s)]
*  And I think it just reignited what made him a comic in the first place. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8473.14s)]
*  He's an outsider for all outsiders. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8478.26s)]
*  You want to be an insider. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8481.66s)]
*  The compromises that come with becoming an insider are not worth it. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8483.38s)]
*  Like what you're trying to do is you'll be more of an insider by not doing that. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8486.98s)]
*  It'd be more of a legend by going back to his roots. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8493.1s)]
*  And that's what he's doing. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8495.38s)]
*  If he wants to forgive Will Smith, you know, that's totally [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8496.74s)]
*  that's totally his choice. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8501.820000000002s)]
*  I don't know what his relationship with Will Smith is. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8503.060000000001s)]
*  I know he had been taunting him, making jokes about him forever, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8505.42s)]
*  but they're pretty fucking mild jokes. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8508.18s)]
*  You know, it wasn't that horrible. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8510.42s)]
*  And. My perspective on it is it just wills, just a person that was in [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8514.42s)]
*  an impossible to understand scenario to be a guy who is a child star, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8521.820000000002s)]
*  who goes from that to become one of the most loved, beloved actors in the world. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8527.060000000001s)]
*  Blockbuster films. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8532.74s)]
*  Everybody loves you to this one thing where everybody fucking hates you. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8534.54s)]
*  Everybody thinks you're a piece of shit. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8539.66s)]
*  It's a human. You got to forgive him. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8542.300000000001s)]
*  So what advice would you give Will? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8544.02s)]
*  What he's already done. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8546.380000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think when he's done has been too coordinated and produced. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8547.5s)]
*  You know, I mean, he gave an apology with multiple camera angles. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8552.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8556.38s)]
*  You just needs to be you and your phone. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8557.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8559.02s)]
*  So it might be potentially part of the problem in the first place. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8559.26s)]
*  Yeah. Set up your phone, say something into your phone that you. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8561.82s)]
*  And you know, I think he has reached out to Chris, [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8565.98s)]
*  but I don't think Chris is interested in talking to him. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8568.58s)]
*  You know, he'll be forgiven. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8571.18s)]
*  It'll take some time. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8573.06s)]
*  It's not the worst thing that people have done. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8574.06s)]
*  Right. It's the embarrassment and shame that he felt from it [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8575.58s)]
*  is the absolute appropriate response. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8579.66s)]
*  He's not doubled down and said, fuck that guy. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8582.1s)]
*  If I see him again, it's on site. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8584.74s)]
*  There's no that stupid shit. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8586.3s)]
*  You know, it's imagine. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8588.3s)]
*  Imagine he did that. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8591.42s)]
*  Got you, bitch. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8592.619999999999s)]
*  Coming for you next time, motherfucker. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8594.06s)]
*  Next time is my left hand. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8595.539999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8596.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'll tell you, it's [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8597.619999999999s)]
*  you know, I was [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8601.26s)]
*  the movie that that, you know, he got the Oscar for King Richard. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8603.78s)]
*  I was in that movie and I was I was at every award show, you know, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8608.34s)]
*  and, you know, it was weird. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8613.3s)]
*  I didn't go to the I decided not to go to that Oscars. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8616.46s)]
*  My son had a doubleheader in his travel baseball team, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8620.46s)]
*  and I was like, you know, I'm hanging out with Big Bill today. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8623.34s)]
*  And good for you. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8625.38s)]
*  And I was watching it with my other son, Henry, who knows [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8626.099999999999s)]
*  Will, who also was just like, you know, why didn't Mr. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8629.099999999999s)]
*  Will do that? Oh, no. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8631.779999999999s)]
*  And and what was crazy is, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8632.98s)]
*  you know, I'm an enormous fan of Chris Rocks, you know, and [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8637.34s)]
*  you know, but I know Will, you know, and [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8640.34s)]
*  I know that Will would hate the fact that my son had that feeling. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8646.34s)]
*  And, you know, you know, for me, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8652.3s)]
*  you know, working for a whole year with him on that movie [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8656.099999999999s)]
*  and then going on the press tour and the award circuit, like [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8659.06s)]
*  look, man, like I've never in my life seen someone who is like [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8662.939999999999s)]
*  kinder or more generous. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8668.38s)]
*  Like it was so it was such an insane moment that revealed such [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8670.22s)]
*  unhealth, just like like a lack of health. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8676.619999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's a great way to put it. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8678.699999999999s)]
*  Just like he is not he is not in there and so horrible. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8680.339999999998s)]
*  And, you know, look, just like as a man going and putting your hands [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8684.14s)]
*  on another man whose hands are behind their back, just like as a cook, like [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8687.699999999999s)]
*  not just that, but Chris Rock is this tiny guy. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8690.699999999999s)]
*  100 percent. So not a threat at all. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8694.019999999999s)]
*  100 percent. And it's like, would you? Yeah, exactly. Right. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8696.18s)]
*  So there's like there's all there's all that. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8699.02s)]
*  But look, you know, I think it's like, you know, it's [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8702.14s)]
*  it's odd because it's like, you know, for for me, with my friends, it's like I, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8705.58s)]
*  you know, I try to judge them, not not for their worst moments, for their best [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8709.34s)]
*  and try to get to the bottom of what's going on. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8712.7s)]
*  You know, but yes, it was, you know, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8715.54s)]
*  I just remember really palpably feeling that, like when my son saw it, [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8719.26s)]
*  like fucking will would have hated that, like the will I know. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8722.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What would have hated that? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8724.7s)]
*  I'm sure he did. I'm sure he does. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8726.02s)]
*  I'm sure he thinks about it every day. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8727.58s)]
*  I'm sure he's like brushing his teeth going, fuck. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8728.94s)]
*  Like, what did I do? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8731.82s)]
*  And, you know, I think it also was an accumulative event [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8733.18s)]
*  of the public humiliation that he felt going on his wife's show [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8737.58s)]
*  and her talking about her relationships with other men, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8741.74s)]
*  including men that were friends with her son. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8744.060000000001s)]
*  The whole thing was just for him to deal with that publicly. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8746.86s)]
*  I had to be so torturous that I think that he just [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8750.94s)]
*  felt this need to stand up for himself in a very [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8755.46s)]
*  poorly thought out, not thought out at all, you know, just impulsive. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8760.26s)]
*  Impulsive. Yeah. Yeah. Horribly impulsive. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8764.18s)]
*  Just and also just speaks to the ego, like where his ego had gotten him [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8766.939999999999s)]
*  to this place where he thought he could do that. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8771.539999999999s)]
*  And he thought he could yell, keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8773.939999999999s)]
*  in front of the Academy, the world, the world, all the cameras. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8777.06s)]
*  Saying it to Chris Rock, who made the most innocuous joke. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8781.900000000001s)]
*  All of it is so crazy. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8787.34s)]
*  But the other part about it is to me, like as a human [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8789.18s)]
*  that enjoys a little bit of chaos, I like when things get fucked up [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8793.74s)]
*  because it lets people know that all this bullshit about tuxedos [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8798.02s)]
*  and clapping and horns playing and the curtains drawn and open and closed. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8801.980000000001s)]
*  And it's all bullshit. We're just human beings. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8807.58s)]
*  And as you said about Chris, Chris is Chris Rock's comedy now. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8810.42s)]
*  There is a potential here for both of these men that that could have been [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8816.54s)]
*  in a way, in a strange way, the most important, potentially best moment [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8821.1s)]
*  in either their artistic life, where they could go from that. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8824.74s)]
*  And I think like, again, I go back to me hitting that guy. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8827.86s)]
*  You know, a year later, July 3rd, 2010, I wrote that guy a letter [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8832.7s)]
*  saying that the person that I hit that night, that wasn't you. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8837.1s)]
*  That was a part of me that I needed to fucking squeeze. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8840.660000000002s)]
*  Did you ever meet him again after that? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8842.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, I met him in court, you know what I mean? Depositions. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8844.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8847.34s)]
*  Whatever happened with the court case? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8848.740000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, I got all I got off in a way criminally, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8850.220000000001s)]
*  you know, because it was a felony assault, man. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8855.740000000002s)]
*  And, you know, attempted manslaughter, you know, is real. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8858.7s)]
*  But there were so many people there that had seen that there was [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8862.26s)]
*  10 of them and one of me that it got reduced down [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8866.1s)]
*  to a misdemeanor battery causing serious bodily harm. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8871.02s)]
*  And and look, you know, I mean, [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8876.34s)]
*  it's one of those cases of the legal system, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8879.380000000001s)]
*  you know, really providing, you know, sort of, you know, it's all carrots [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8882.9s)]
*  and sticks, right. And for me, I was just I was placed on this probation [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8886.78s)]
*  for three years that said, you know, have I be not even arrested. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8891.140000000001s)]
*  But like, had I been present at a violent crime [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8896.1s)]
*  any time in those three years, mandatory year in L.A. County jail, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8898.74s)]
*  had I get charged for a crime, it was 10 years for a violent crime, 10 years. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8904.300000000001s)]
*  So for a guy, unfortunately, and I'm disgusted to say this about myself, [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8907.82s)]
*  but that was not like that crazy of an event for me at that point in my life, [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8912.86s)]
*  which is so fucking disgusting. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8916.02s)]
*  But, you know, it meant like change everything. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8918.62s)]
*  Like, you know, and I think change for people is really [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8921.98s)]
*  tough. I think you got it. You got it. Yeah, man. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8926.1s)]
*  You got to rip. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8927.94s)]
*  You got to rip out this like whole part of your identity, man. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8929.18s)]
*  You got to just like get rid of it. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8932.42s)]
*  But then you walk around with this fucking hole and everything that made people [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=8934.18s)]

*  And I was like, well, why would you do that, sir? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9023.58s)]
*  Like, my wife's done nothing to you know. But, you know, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9025.26s)]
*  I don't know. But even even that, man, like, you know, there was so much shame [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9030.98s)]
*  and so much disgust for the way that I was living my life. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9035.9s)]

*  and that I didn't have and really set us back as we were trying to start a family. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9046.3s)]
*  But again, I really that that moment [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9050.9s)]
*  we're leaving, it was as low as I kind of felt like I had ever been. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9055.699999999999s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways really saved my life. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9060.3s)]
*  Those moments are critical. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9062.66s)]
*  And there's ways you can respond to those moments. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9064.18s)]
*  And you responded in the best possible way, I think. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9068.019999999999s)]
*  And, you know, life is chaos. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9070.740000000002s)]
*  There's a lot going on, you know, and if you're if you encounter [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9074.26s)]

*  and the way you described it, I probably would have done [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9083.18s)]
*  the exact same thing today, unfortunately. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9084.62s)]
*  And I like, what do you do? [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9087.460000000001s)]
*  Like when you're confronted by that part of you is triggered [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9088.980000000001s)]
*  and you realize that this piece of shit is pushing you from the back [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9092.86s)]
*  and you can just flatline them. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9096.42s)]
*  It's very difficult to not do that. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9098.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it takes. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9100.86s)]
*  I mean, I think then, you know, for me, it was like really doing a lot of work, man. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9101.980000000001s)]
*  Like really doing. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9106.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like court ordered anger management. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9108.300000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, other times where I had court ordered stuff in my life, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9110.7s)]
*  I was like, I was like, you know, court ordered, you know, drug rehab. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9114.060000000001s)]
*  Like it just get high as fucking go in there. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9117.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9119.62s)]
*  Like I'm going to trip ass and go to, you know, I mean, go see if I can like, [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9121.02s)]
*  you know, pick up a girl in here, you know, like just like a total, total asshole. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9123.820000000002s)]
*  But, but, you know, you know, for me, [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9127.38s)]
*  you know, I mean, sounds crazy. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9131.98s)]
*  But I mean, just for people out there that might be dealing with that kind of stuff, [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9133.42s)]
*  like keeping an anger journal, like figuring out what what pisses you off, [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9136.619999999999s)]
*  like figuring out like how long it pisses you off, figuring out what triggers you, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9140.779999999999s)]
*  figuring out what it makes you think you really want to do to be like really [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9144.42s)]
*  working on that shit. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9147.42s)]
*  You know, I don't know, man. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9149.66s)]
*  And look, I mean, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9150.98s)]
*  don't get me wrong, like I'm I'm I'm still me. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9153.699999999999s)]
*  And I know I know exactly, you know, it's like my kids and my wife, man, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9156.3s)]
*  just as long as you know. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9160.699999999999s)]
*  But besides that, I'm not I'm not going to get into any, you know, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9162.58s)]
*  you can't you know, nothing's going to make me mad. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9166.58s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm filled with I'm I'm I'm filled with gratitude. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9168.9s)]
*  You're on the right journey. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9172.779999999999s)]
*  You know, you you had a pivotal moment in your life and you self corrected. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9174.46s)]
*  It's huge. It's huge for anyone to hear that, too, because that's possible. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9180.259999999998s)]
*  And you don't think it's possible when you're in the depths of it. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9183.3s)]
*  When you're in the depths of something that's awful, you just feel like [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9186.619999999999s)]
*  this is my new reality. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9189.099999999999s)]
*  But oftentimes through that new reality, that's where the growth comes. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9190.74s)]
*  And that's where the change comes. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9194.019999999999s)]
*  And that's where, you know, you are an accumulation of your life experiences [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9195.22s)]
*  and how you respond to those experiences and sometimes profound things [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9199.42s)]
*  can cause profound change. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9204.06s)]
*  And in your case, for the better. That's right. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9205.9s)]
*  That's right. And and and and. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9209.3s)]
*  And there's there's there's nothing more powerful than than changing. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9211.22s)]
*  And you know, I'd like completely support, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9216.38s)]
*  I completely support and believe in any anyone's ability to do that. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9219.34s)]
*  The more we write people off and we use these unbelievably insignificant, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9223.74s)]
*  you know, sort of means to to to to to to to not be forgiving [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9229.42s)]
*  or to put people in these boxes, it's a huge mistake. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9234.06s)]
*  It's a huge mistake for the person that's doing that, too, for sure, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9236.859999999999s)]
*  because they have this [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9239.62s)]
*  unflexible, uncharitable view of people forever. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9241.94s)]
*  Like, what if that comes around on you, man? [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9245.740000000002s)]
*  And that's you don't want that. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9247.660000000002s)]
*  You don't want that for you. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9248.980000000001s)]
*  And you don't want that for other people. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9249.820000000002s)]
*  Again, we're all just human beings. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9251.580000000002s)]
*  But we lose sight of that because these kind of conversations [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9253.5s)]
*  where people get to fully express all the emotions and thoughts behind that, [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9257.1s)]
*  they're not that common. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9262.02s)]
*  And they're they're they're very recent, in fact, in in humanity. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9263.5s)]
*  We really haven't had like enormous platforms [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9269.42s)]
*  where people can express themselves the way you just did. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9272.94s)]
*  And it can affect so many people in a positive way. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9278.82s)]
*  It's that's one of the beautiful things about what you're doing, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9282.54s)]
*  what you're doing with your show is that you you're giving a voice [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9285.42s)]
*  to these thoughts and circumstances and situations and people [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9290.82s)]
*  that it's not easy to hear that voice. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9294.78s)]
*  That voice is not amplified. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9297.78s)]
*  It's not on mainstream media. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9299.619999999999s)]
*  It's not in newspapers. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9301.86s)]
*  And even if it is, you're not going to read it. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9303.26s)]
*  It's just you put it in a very digestible way [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9304.94s)]
*  that is impactful to many, many people. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9310.06s)]
*  And there's people out there that I'm sure are listening to this right now [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9313.66s)]
*  and listening to your story and realizing that they have an opportunity [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9318.1s)]
*  in their life to enact the same kind of change and the same kind of positive [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9322.3s)]
*  change of direction that you did for yourself. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9328.02s)]
*  They can do it for themselves, too. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9331.539999999999s)]
*  And they can realize that it's you know, you look at a person [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9333.46s)]
*  and we always like to put look at a person as the static thing. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9336.539999999999s)]
*  That's one thing that I really came to grips with [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9340.38s)]
*  being becoming a father is that I used to think of people as like, [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9344.539999999999s)]
*  oh, this is Bob. He's 40. He's a piece of shit. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9348.9s)]
*  Now I think, oh, that was a baby. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9351.66s)]
*  That was a baby. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9353.78s)]
*  And he either wasn't loved or was abused or was in a terrible situation. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9355.34s)]
*  And through bad life choices and bad circumstances surrounded by the worst [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9361.900000000001s)]
*  people, one event leads into the other. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9366.300000000001s)]
*  The momentum carries him into a terrible place. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9368.5s)]
*  And now here, Bob finds himself at 40 where people think he's a piece of shit. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9371.140000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure he self defines by that, too, because of other people's opinions. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9374.58s)]
*  So true. And I mean, that that perspective that, you know, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9378.980000000001s)]
*  the father thing, that just that just changes. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9382.1s)]
*  Changes everything. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9384.86s)]
*  There's a monumental shift. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9386.1s)]
*  First of all, seeing life that didn't exist before and realizing [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9388.42s)]
*  that it came about through you and your wife is so strange. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9391.82s)]
*  It's so psychedelic because it's like it there. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9396.46s)]
*  You know, people all parent parenting changes you. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9400.38s)]
*  You say that to someone who doesn't have kids. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9402.78s)]
*  They really have no fucking idea what you're talking about. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9404.3s)]
*  But I've seen it in so many of my friends that they have children. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9406.699999999999s)]
*  And also, there's this softening of who they are in this [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9409.9s)]
*  understanding of what's really important, you know, and that what's really. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9413.859999999999s)]
*  It's so cliche, but love love is what's really important. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9419.74s)]
*  Friendship, love and trying to get over your own bullshit [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9423.18s)]
*  and figure out life for you. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9427.9s)]
*  What is the best path for you? [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9430.38s)]
*  And what are the steps that you have to do every fucking day [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9433.26s)]
*  to stay on that good path? [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9437.3s)]
*  Because it's so easy to make change for a little while [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9439.46s)]
*  and then slide right back into your old bullshit. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9442.699999999999s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9445.699999999999s)]
*  It's got to be. But nothing will nothing will provide that vitality for you [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9446.9s)]
*  and how utterly and absolutely essential it is and having kids. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9450.18s)]
*  And I think for me, I mean, I even look, you know, I have to spend [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9455.26s)]
*  so much time on the road and it's it's a you know, it's a [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9458.26s)]
*  I hate that I hate that. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9463.539999999999s)]
*  But, you know, while I'm gone, you know, the reason why, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9465.14s)]
*  you know, I'm not like fucking eating Chinese food and like at the bar [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9468.539999999999s)]
*  is because, you know, I'm away from my kids, I'm putting my kids name on my work. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9471.74s)]
*  So it's like I'm going to be committed to whatever I have to do for that. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9475.26s)]
*  Like that that really fucking matters to me. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9477.98s)]
*  Like, I really want them to look back and say, you know, Dad, [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9480.099999999999s)]
*  that put it all in there, you know, I mean, that's that's funny. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfXxdBMkvhs&t=9483.38s)]
