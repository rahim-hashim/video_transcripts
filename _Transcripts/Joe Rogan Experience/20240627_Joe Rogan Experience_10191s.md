# Joe Rogan Experience #2039 - Michael Easter
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up. Hello, Michael. Good to see you, buddy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, likewise, man. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=15.0s)]
*  Last time I saw you, we were in Elk Camp in Utah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=16.0s)]
*  We were indeed in Elk Camp. It was a good time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=19.0s)]
*  So I was just pointing out to you about these discoveries they've found at the Boneyard in Alaska. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=21.0s)]
*  And my friend John Reeves, who's been on the podcast before, Jamie, I'm going to send this to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=29.0s)]
*  You got it already? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=34.0s)]
*  So the most recent thing they found is evidence that looks like saw marks on these bones. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=36.0s)]
*  It looks like they saw these bones to get the marrow out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=45.0s)]
*  Now, a lot of these bones that they've dated are 10,000 plus years old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=48.0s)]
*  And the thing is, the saw was really supposedly invented somewhere around 7,000 years ago. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=53.0s)]
*  I feel like we often think that early humans weren't as advanced as they actually were. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=60.0s)]
*  And every time we make a new discovery, it just pushes it back. It pushes it back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=68.0s)]
*  And you learn that people were way more interesting, had a lot more tools, had a lot more skills than I think we think. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is really interesting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=80.0s)]
*  I mean, if they do date this, some of the stuff they've dated is like 30,000 plus years old that they've found out here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=83.0s)]
*  The Boneyard is an amazing place. I think it's the Boneyard Alaska is the Instagram page. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=90.0s)]
*  Do you know where on the map it is in Alaska? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=96.0s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=98.0s)]
*  Do you know, Jamie? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=99.0s)]
*  I sort of remember. It's in the middle of Alaska. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=100.0s)]
*  But this is amazing. He's also found some bones from some animals that supposedly didn't even live there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=103.0s)]
*  Some certain cats, ancient cats. The craziest thing is it's a very small area. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=111.0s)]
*  He's excavating somewhere in the neighborhood of like six and a half acres. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=117.0s)]
*  And there's another place that's like somewhere similar in size. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=123.0s)]
*  And they're finding massive amounts of bones in these areas like woolly mammoth tusks and all this crazy stuff. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=127.0s)]
*  But this is really interesting because that seems to be really clear evidence of tools that were used to saw bone. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=135.0s)]
*  Another one they found. Like, look at this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=143.0s)]
*  And the cut is so clean. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=145.0s)]
*  So it really does look like a saw that they sawed to get to the marrow, which is wild stuff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=148.0s)]
*  I don't know if anyone has ever found anything like this before, but it's pretty extraordinary. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=157.0s)]
*  Changes how we think about how advanced we were. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=164.0s)]
*  I mean, who knows? I mean, maybe they could find out that the saw marks are actually only a thousand years old. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=166.0s)]
*  And someone found these bones and tried to saw them a thousand years. I mean, I don't know. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=172.0s)]
*  Humans are amazing because we're such great explorers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=176.0s)]
*  That's something that I think makes us so unique among animals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=183.0s)]
*  All right. So Homo sapiens comes out and we take over the world in a very short amount of time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=184.0s)]
*  Neanderthals lived 200,000 years. They basically made it into Europe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=190.0s)]
*  We get Homo sapiens. All of a sudden they move into the Americas. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=194.0s)]
*  We put freaking boats in the water and go to Australia. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=200.0s)]
*  We take submarines down to the bottom of the ocean. We shoot off rockets into outer space. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=204.0s)]
*  We are a species that never stops exploring. We want to know what is that? What's over there? I want to find out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=210.0s)]
*  Massive curiosity. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=218.0s)]
*  Massive curiosity. And it's shaped us so much. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=219.0s)]
*  So my book, Scarcity Brain, which is coming out soon, it has a whole chapter on this and why exploration is so important to humans as a species. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=223.0s)]
*  But also how it's changed. So if you think about how people explore today, we still explore in a sense, but it's mediated through the internet. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=233.0s)]
*  So it's like we have this urge to find information that can enhance our life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=240.0s)]
*  In the past, you had to go there. You had to go talk to someone. You had to go up around the riverbend. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=245.0s)]
*  You had to go, OK, where is this greener grass? I'm going to go find it on foot. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=250.0s)]
*  And there's going to be some amount of effort. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=254.0s)]
*  Now when we have this sort of information itch, we scratch it through a screen, which on one hand, that's great because we can get information quickly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=257.0s)]
*  On the other hand, it's so easy to access and there's so little effort we have to do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=267.0s)]
*  I think sometimes we get overwhelmed by it. And it's a very different form of information we can get today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's also it's leading us into this seemingly inevitable path of this conversion of humans and technology that seems to be happening, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=280.0s)]
*  whether we like it or not, that really doesn't seem to jive well with our biology. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to tell what is true and false today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=298.0s)]
*  And I think there is less of a well, now that we have screens, you don't have to go talk to someone in person. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=304.0s)]
*  Right. If you want to learn something, even just 20 years ago, I was like, OK, I'm going to go to the library. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=313.0s)]
*  I've got to go find out where this book is. I've got to use Dewey Decimal System. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=318.0s)]
*  I've got to walk the stacks. I'm going to find it. I'm going to put in this time and effort and I'm going to learn something. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=323.0s)]
*  If I want to learn something about a human, I'm going to go talk to them. Right. I'm going to go face to face like, hey, what do you think? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=328.0s)]
*  And I think now everything has become so easy that that can backfire a little bit. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=333.0s)]
*  It's very easy to just scratch the information itch all the time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=339.0s)]
*  And it's not necessarily leading to more understanding. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=344.0s)]
*  There's a difference between knowledge and understanding. Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you pursue it, there's more information and there is more knowledge if you really get after it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=352.0s)]
*  But how many people do that? How many people just read? I do that all the time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=360.0s)]
*  I just read a headline. I go, do you hear? You know, and I didn't even go into the article. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=364.0s)]
*  And oftentimes you get in the article, you're like, oh, what is this based on? Oh, this is bullshit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=368.0s)]
*  And then you go further and then you find out, oh, no, no, no, it's not real at all. Right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=372.0s)]
*  There's a lot of layers. And yeah, what made me start thinking about this is I'm sitting at home and I get this email. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=377.0s)]
*  And it's from someone who claims that they're with NASA. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=385.0s)]
*  They go, hey, we got this astronaut. His name is Mark Vande Hei. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=388.0s)]
*  We do this program where if an astronaut wants to talk to someone, we'll put them in. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=392.0s)]
*  We'll put you two in touch and you can FaceTime with him while he's in outer space. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=396.0s)]
*  And I'm going, is this like the new Nigerian prince scheme? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=400.0s)]
*  What do you need from me? Just access to my bank account. No big deal. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=405.0s)]
*  At what point do I hand over the credit card? Right. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=408.0s)]
*  So but I go, OK, because it's at NASA dot gov. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=411.0s)]
*  OK, that seems they can spook that, though. I'm sure they could. I've gotten emails from me for at NASA, Joe, at NASA. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=415.0s)]
*  No, back in the day, I used to I got an email that was from my website, from an email that I don't have. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=421.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I was like, what is this? That's wacky. Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=428.0s)]
*  But I go along with it. Right. And so they set up this video conference. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=431.0s)]
*  I have to download this special software. And I'm thinking, well, this is where it comes in. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=435.0s)]
*  Yep. And then all of a sudden I'm waiting for this guy to show up and then bam, there he is. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=440.0s)]
*  And I know it's not a long con because the dude is floating in outer space. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=446.0s)]
*  He's up in the ISS. So he had read The Comfort Crisis, my last book, and just wanted to chat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=451.0s)]
*  So NASA will do this to sort of give astronauts a boost to talk to someone else, anyone they want to talk to. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=458.0s)]
*  And what came out of that conversation was that he is up there for the sole purpose of getting information that can hopefully help us live on as a species. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=464.0s)]
*  Should we have to leave this planet and go find another? But sort of back to what we were talking about, for him to do that, he has to put in this mind, body effort to go get that information. Right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=473.0s)]
*  He literally has to go up into outer space to figure these things out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=485.0s)]
*  And he talked about how oftentimes when he will come back home and he'll go to schools, he'll go to universities, he goes, at some point in every talk, I had this run of like 30 talks where the Q&A, someone always asked me if the world is flat. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=489.0s)]
*  And he goes, I did not know how to take that because I would kind of just, you know, know. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=506.0s)]
*  And then they would start to fire off facts and he's like, yeah, yeah, but no. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=512.0s)]
*  And so I think that that with minimal barrier to entry, you can find information that confirms your worldview and just follow that strange rabbit hole, even though it's not leading. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah, that rabbit hole is the wildest one. That there's been this long standing conspiracy to deny the fact that the Earth is flat, to hide it and obscure it and that all of these space agencies all over the world are all working in cahoots to try to perpetuate this hoax. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I can tell you when he, one, he took me, you know, around the ISS and showed me the place over Zoom. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=548.0s)]
*  And then two, at one point he flips the screen and shows me the Earth. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=557.0s)]
*  And at least in that instance, I can tell you that it was round. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=563.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just a disk. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=566.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=568.0s)]
*  That's what a lot of the in deep people think. They think it's a disk. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=569.0s)]
*  I think it's all a religious thing. They think that they're going off of some passages in the Bible where they refer to the firmament and they refer to like they believe somehow there's like this dome over the Earth and that the stars just lights. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=573.0s)]
*  And the reason why the moon landing is fake is because the moon is not real. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=593.0s)]
*  I read that one today. I was like, oh boy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=598.0s)]
*  And then, you know, some people think that stars are fake. They don't think space is real. They think it's all a con by Satan or someone. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=601.0s)]
*  And then that all these space agencies are in cahoots with Satan, which is really wild. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=610.0s)]
*  If you think about like, did they deny sound like how much did they deny? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=616.0s)]
*  Do you believe in direct TV? Is that a satellite? Okay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=620.0s)]
*  Do you believe that the satellites are taking photos? Are they taking any? What about the weather patterns? What about their ability to discern weather patterns as they move across the globe? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=625.0s)]
*  What about the flight patterns? What about the fact that you could actually track planes as they go around the globe? Like, what do you think about that? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=635.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, there's Japan has. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=644.0s)]
*  Japan has a very sophisticated satellite system where they're taking high resolution photos of the Earth like every few seconds. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=649.0s)]
*  Right. Isn't that what it is? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=658.0s)]
*  Yeah, a few people do that. Yeah. Private companies that do that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=660.0s)]
*  And they think that's bullshit. That's all lies. But it's like, what do you have to like? What are you getting out of that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=663.0s)]
*  Like, why would they do that? That's I don't understand what they think the motivation is. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=671.0s)]
*  I think that some things are complicated in life. And I think that humans really like certainty. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=678.0s)]
*  So we are species who just crave certainty. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=687.0s)]
*  There's actually some fun studies where people will choose to get shocked by an electric zap rather than wait to see if they're going to get zapped. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=692.0s)]
*  Like, just get it over with because I want to be certain about this thing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=702.0s)]
*  And so I think that a lot of conspiracies, even though they seem complicated, because, you know, there's the board with the strings going everywhere. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=705.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, they give certainty to something that is uncertain and is complicated. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=713.0s)]
*  And that can sort of be relieving. You go, OK, well, this world being flat doesn't jive with my worldview. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=719.0s)]
*  I think X, Y, Z. This doesn't make any damn sense. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=725.0s)]
*  And then you can go, oh, well, what if it's flat? And then there's like sort of this trail you can follow online where at the end it goes, bam, you got it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=728.0s)]
*  You're good to go. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=735.0s)]
*  I think people are always looking to find things out that they've been lied about. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=737.0s)]
*  So I think they believe they don't trust the government. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=743.0s)]
*  They believe, you know, various conspiracies and like the Gulf of Tonkin, ones that have turned out to be true. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=747.0s)]
*  And then they go, OK, what else? What else? And there's something very exciting about it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=752.0s)]
*  Also, a lot of the people that are really into it, for whatever reason, I mean, I don't want to like stereotype, but a lot of them are unsuccessful in other aspects of their life. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=758.0s)]
*  They might be successful in one thing or something like that, but there's something about it that like leads them to want to be the one who uncovers this truth. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=769.0s)]
*  And I think it's like it plays on the mind like we have this desire to go and find things like that's part of the explorer gene or whatever it is, the explorer, whatever, whatever it is that makes us want to get in a boat and say, like, where's Hawaii? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=779.0s)]
*  You know, like, how about those guys, the Polynesians? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=797.0s)]
*  I mean, what a crazy trip they they went all the way out to the middle of the ocean. They found this volcano. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=800.0s)]
*  There used to be people who would I can't remember what tribe this is, but these tribes would get in a boat and go hundreds of miles. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=806.0s)]
*  And it was all for the sake of meeting another tribe. And they would sort of exchange a couple goods that weren't really that meaningful, which suggests it really was for the journey. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=814.0s)]
*  Right. They were doing this just to explore, to take on an adventure, to learn from it and bring back this thing that was sort of meaningless in the grand scheme of things. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=824.0s)]
*  But it was symbolic, very symbolic that they had done this great journey. And I think this was in the Polynesian Islands where this happened, like around the Philippines. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=836.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess there's also this longing to understand how people can live in different places. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=845.0s)]
*  If you're used to living on a certain like tropical island and then you find out about someone who lives in like the Taiga forest in Siberia, like how? What are they doing? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=850.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine before there was video, before there was the Internet and really before there were books, people would hear about these people that did these things. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=860.0s)]
*  And they're like, where are these people? Like, how are they living like this? And there's probably this overwhelming desire to see because you would live the way you lived and you would say, well, this is how people live. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=869.0s)]
*  And you'd be like, no, no, no, people live so differently. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=880.0s)]
*  Like some of these explorers that went to these uncharted islands and found these people that were living essentially like, you know, Stone Age like no access to fire. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=883.0s)]
*  And they're living on this island like, what? Like, what is going on over here? How is this real? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=893.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. And to with your question about that sometimes people who get really, really deep down those rabbit holes aren't successful. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=898.0s)]
*  I think it provides an answer for why the person isn't successful. Right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=907.0s)]
*  You can find a reason like, oh, it's it's them that's done this thing. And this is why I have X, Y, Z problem. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=913.0s)]
*  And I think that and it also pulls on, like I said, I think we have a drive to search for information. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=920.0s)]
*  So if you think about humans in the past, as we evolved, there was a handful of things you really needed to survive. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=927.0s)]
*  Food, possessions, tools, information. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=934.0s)]
*  We crave status as well, because if you could influence more people, you probably had a survival edge. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=939.0s)]
*  And so I think when you start to apply that to today's world, because in the past, all those things were relatively scarce. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=944.0s)]
*  They were hard to find. So if you sort of crave them and always look for them, try to grab them when you had the opportunity, you would have that survival advantage. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=952.0s)]
*  But in today's world, all these things that we evolved to crave are abundant in many ways. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=960.0s)]
*  And we don't necessarily have the governor telling us when we've had too much. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=965.0s)]
*  So take something like possessions. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=970.0s)]
*  Even a couple hundred years ago, the average person probably had like 100 items, maybe in their house. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=974.0s)]
*  Now the average home has 10,000 items in it. Really? Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=981.0s)]
*  Ten thousand items. It's the range is 10,000 that I've seen to 40,000. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=984.0s)]
*  And then there's people that collect stuff like trading cards, you know, or stamps, coins, exactly. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=989.0s)]
*  And they get obsessed with collecting these things. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=997.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And I think it does fall back into the fact that we kind of evolved to add, whether it's food, whether it's stuff, whether it's trying to influence more people, whatever it might be. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1001.0s)]
*  And that can kind of create a cycle for people where the pursuit of the thing is like a thrill in of itself. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1014.0s)]
*  And then you get it. You go, oh, that's fun. I got to go do that. Yeah. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1024.0s)]
*  And then they got to get another one. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1028.0s)]
*  That's it's such a weird it sort of plays on these original survival instincts. Right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1031.0s)]
*  You're in your search for food, your search for shelter, your search for fertile hunting grounds. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1038.0s)]
*  You know, you have humans have this sort of inherent desire to go and find things. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1044.0s)]
*  And then something comes along that just monkeys with that, like stamps. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1050.0s)]
*  Like now there's you have to get this 1972 Abraham Lincoln, you know, fucking stamp. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1055.0s)]
*  And, you know, you're you're on this quest to get it. Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1062.0s)]
*  And people pay extraordinary amounts of money for these things, too. Tons. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1065.0s)]
*  Especially like cards like baseball cards and stuff like that. Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1069.0s)]
*  I mean, that's bonkers. How much people pay for those. Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1073.0s)]
*  I was at my mom's house the other day and I was going through my old basketball cards I used to collect. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1076.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, here's a kind of interesting card. Like that player was pretty good. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1080.0s)]
*  I look it up. I'm like, oh, my God, it's worth that much money. It's crazy. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1083.0s)]
*  Because they don't make them anymore. Yeah. Exactly. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1087.0s)]
*  Even though it's no big deal. It's just a piece of paper. Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1090.0s)]
*  So as part of this book, I got really interested in this idea of, you know, everyone knows that everything is fine in moderation. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1093.0s)]
*  But then the question is like, OK, well, why the hell can't we moderate? Right. Right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1101.0s)]
*  People keep eating when they're full. You keep buying stuff when you got a house full of stuff, even stuff like how much media we consume. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1106.0s)]
*  Right. It's like people will scroll and scroll and scroll, even though they know this is not how they want to be spending their time. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1113.0s)]
*  I've spent so many nights where I went to bed at three o'clock in the morning feeling like a fucking idiot. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1119.0s)]
*  Like, what did I do? I just wasted time watching dumb videos and reading dumb websites and just going down. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1125.0s)]
*  And I'm tired and I should just go to bed. But I just whatever. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1132.0s)]
*  Like, maybe the next thing is going to really excite me. Maybe the next video is really going to stimulate. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1135.0s)]
*  No, no. It's always the same feeling. I go to bed like fucking idiot. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1140.0s)]
*  You should have been in bed three hours ago. And everyone has that experience. Right. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1145.0s)]
*  And so I live in Las Vegas, which happens to be a good town to think about why the hell can't we moderate. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1150.0s)]
*  Now, when you live there, you see all kinds of wild stuff. Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1157.0s)]
*  But to me, what's always been the strangest has been the slot machines. So you've spent time in Vegas. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1163.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like they're in the can senos, obviously, but they're in the gas stations, the grocery stores, the restaurants, the bars and the airport. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1169.0s)]
*  And they're not sitting empty. Right. People are playing them around the clock. Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1179.0s)]
*  So I'm like, what the hell is up with that? Just plays in your dopamine. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1184.0s)]
*  Well, and it doesn't make sense because everyone knows the house always wins. Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1188.0s)]
*  It's not. It's like a numbing thing. They just sit there and press the buttons and press the buttons and press the buttons and hope they make money. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1192.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I decide, all right, like, I'm going to find out how a slot machine works. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1201.0s)]
*  Why do people get hooked on slot machines? That's the question. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1205.0s)]
*  And so I go into journalist mode and I start making calls. Now, the first group of people that I call turns out to be a dead end. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1208.0s)]
*  So who I call are people who are effectively anti gambling researchers. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1215.0s)]
*  OK, so these are researchers who have a very anti gambling bent and they tell me all sorts of sort of strange things. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1219.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, it's because casinos don't have clocks. They're like these myths. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1226.0s)]
*  We've all heard casinos don't have clocks. Slot machines only play in the key of C, which relaxes people and relaxes their wallet. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1230.0s)]
*  Casinos don't have any right angles and right angles activate the rational part of your brain. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1238.0s)]
*  And so I go, OK. And then I go to an actual casino and there's right angles everywhere. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1244.0s)]
*  Right. The screens are right angles. No clocks. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1250.0s)]
*  But guess who else doesn't have clocks like most businesses? Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1255.0s)]
*  There's not clocks in Costco restaurants. Right. Yeah. It's not normal to have clocks. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1259.0s)]
*  And then for the the audio, the key of C, I call up a slot machine audio composer. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1263.0s)]
*  Now, this is a real job you can have in Las Vegas. Right. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1269.0s)]
*  And this guy goes, where the hell do you hear that? He's like, I use all keys. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1272.0s)]
*  So I realized that the problem that I'm encountering is that I have called people who want us to stop gambling. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1276.0s)]
*  I need to call people who want us to start gambling. All right. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1284.0s)]
*  I got to follow the money on this. So long story short, I talked to a handful of people in town. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1288.0s)]
*  And this leads me to this casino on the outside outskirts of Las Vegas. That's brand new. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1293.0s)]
*  It's cutting edge. But the catch is that it's not open to the public. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1299.0s)]
*  So this place is basically a living, breathing casino, but it's used entirely for research on human behavior. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1303.0s)]
*  What? Yeah. So really, who funds that? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1309.0s)]
*  Seventy three different companies. So there's gambling companies that are involved, but also a bunch of big tech companies who are on the Fortune 500. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1313.0s)]
*  So I go there and it's like I said, it's a legit casino. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1321.0s)]
*  How big is it? It's I would say it's not the size of a normal casino like a sprawling strip one. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1328.0s)]
*  It's probably about the size of your everything you have here, maybe a little bigger, but they have hotel rooms like a Wal-Mart. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1335.0s)]
*  Yeah, big. Yeah, it's in this big office building basically. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1344.0s)]
*  And they're basically looking at how everything that happens in a casino affects human behavior. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1348.0s)]
*  So how does room design and the technology we're using in rooms affect behavior? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1356.0s)]
*  How does betting with say an AI bot versus an actual human impact betting? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1361.0s)]
*  Now, when I'm there, I meet with to bring it back to slot machines. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1367.0s)]
*  I meet with a guy who designs slot machines. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1371.0s)]
*  So the reason that these things are so entrancing to people, it tracks back to this behavior loop that I call the scarcity loop. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1374.0s)]
*  And this is a basically a loop looping behavior that when people do it, they tend to get hooked on it very easy. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1382.0s)]
*  So it's got three parts. It's got opportunity, unpredictable rewards and quick repeatability. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1389.0s)]
*  So opportunity, you have an opportunity to get something of value. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1396.0s)]
*  So in the case of a slot machine, it's money. Right. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1400.0s)]
*  Two unpredictable rewards. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1403.0s)]
*  You know you're going to get the thing of value if you continue the behavior, but you don't know when and you don't know how valuable it's going to be. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1405.0s)]
*  So with a slot machine game, when those reels are spinning, you could win nothing. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1413.0s)]
*  You can basically lose your money. You could win a couple of dollars or you could win a life changing amount of money. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1418.0s)]
*  There's a fantastic range of things that could happen. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1423.0s)]
*  And then three quick repeatability. You can immediately repeat the behavior. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1426.0s)]
*  So with slot machines, the average player plays about 16 games a minute. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1430.0s)]
*  And that's different from all other habits. Like most habits, you don't immediately repeat them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1437.0s)]
*  Now, the reason that people are so interested in this company's casinos is because this sort of three part system I just laid out, it can get people to repeat a lot of other behaviors, too. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1441.0s)]
*  So it's in social media. It's in sports gambling. It's in dating apps. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1454.0s)]
*  Even companies like gig work economy companies are using it to get people to work longer hours. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1461.0s)]
*  It's being leveraged by the financial industry and a lot of personal finance apps and on and on and on. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1468.0s)]
*  It's become it's been embedded in so many of the products, even institutions that influence people's lives because it is so captivating to us. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1475.0s)]
*  We tend to get hooked on this three part system. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1485.0s)]
*  And so when you're talking about like gig economy stuff like you're talking about like Uber, things along those lines. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1489.0s)]
*  Driving for Uber. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1496.0s)]
*  And so how how do they use that? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1497.0s)]
*  So things like unpredictable rewards get put up in front of a driver to get them to drive into an area of town that Uber might want them to be in. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1500.0s)]
*  There's also unpredictable rewards. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1509.0s)]
*  Yeah. So like you might get say, oh, if you drive here like you're whatever will you'll make X amount more money. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1512.0s)]
*  And it sort of pops up unpredictably. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1519.0s)]
*  Also, they'll they'll incentivize you that they offer you more money to go to a different part of town. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1521.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or dropping in queues that saying like, hey, this is where we are. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1526.0s)]
*  You're going to make more money today type of thing. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1530.0s)]
*  If you think about it in terms of something like social media, it's like the opportunity is to get, say, status or likes or whatever it is. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1533.0s)]
*  Right. And then say a person posts and then the rewards become totally unpredictable. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1542.0s)]
*  Right. You might get two likes, which is like, oh, that wasn't great. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1548.0s)]
*  Or you might get hundreds of likes, which is like, oh, my God, that's amazing. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1551.0s)]
*  It's the same exact architecture as a slot machine. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1555.0s)]
*  And then you check and recheck. You're repeating the behavior all day. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1558.0s)]
*  And this loop, the reason that we're so attracted to it, it goes back to evolution. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1562.0s)]
*  So I talked to this once I learned how this kind of loop pulls people in. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1571.0s)]
*  It's really what slot machines lean on to get people to repeat the behavior. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1575.0s)]
*  I call up a psychologist. He's this old school dude from the University of Kentucky who's been studying psychology since the late 60s. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1579.0s)]
*  His name's Thomas Sental. And he described he basically explained this likely goes back to evolution and finding food. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1588.0s)]
*  So if you think about hunter gathers, the thing you have to do every day is find food. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1597.0s)]
*  But it's a random it's random whether you're going to find the food or not. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1602.0s)]
*  So you go to point A, you don't find any food. Go to point B, you don't find any food. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1606.0s)]
*  You go to point C, no food. Point D. Oh, my God. It's a giant berry bush full of food. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1611.0s)]
*  And that saves your life. Right. So that search, that repeat searching really pushes us and grabs our attention [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1617.0s)]
*  because it used to help us survive in the past. And there's even I mean, if you want to get down the rabbit hole in it, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1625.0s)]
*  there's even things like what are called near misses in slot machines, which is when you kind of almost win. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1631.0s)]
*  Right. You might get lemons. Yeah. Two lemons. And the other lemon just barely passes by. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1639.0s)]
*  Barely passes by or losses disguised as wins. Do you know what those are? No. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1644.0s)]
*  So that's when let's say you bet one dollar and you quote unquote win 50 cents. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1649.0s)]
*  So, oh, right. So you don't lose everything, but you win 50 cents. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1655.0s)]
*  Now, we tend to react to that as if we're winning when they when they study gamblers. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1659.0s)]
*  And that's also embedded in the search for food. Right. You might let's say you're hunting. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1665.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, we got a big kill on our hands. And then you whiff and the animals on its way. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1669.0s)]
*  And you're like, damn, that is a that's a right. That's the near miss. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1673.0s)]
*  Or you come up on a berry bush and let's say it took you you burn 500 calories looking for this thing. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1677.0s)]
*  And it only contains 200 calories worth of food. And so all of these sort of evolutionary parts of this system [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1685.0s)]
*  that we used to fall into as we evolved are now in slot machines and in turn now being used by a lot of big tech companies and different industries. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1692.0s)]
*  So they just trick the human reward system. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1700.0s)]
*  It mimics these sort of ancient pathways, more or less. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1703.0s)]
*  And gambling is to me is one of the most peculiar ones because it's so overwhelming for people that are hooked on gambling. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1706.0s)]
*  It's such a mental health issue. It's such an addiction. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1715.0s)]
*  And when you see people that are just like chasing it and they just can't stop, it's like I always wonder like what pathway is being hijacked? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1719.0s)]
*  Like what what is about human beings that want to risk like literally all of their money on a roll the dice or on a spin of the roulette wheel or on a hand of cards? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1729.0s)]
*  Like what is that? Yeah, this is a good question. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1741.0s)]
*  Now, this this Zantol guy that I told you about, he does a lot of research on pigeons. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1745.0s)]
*  So he can basically turn a pigeon into a degenerate gambler in like two minutes. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1752.0s)]
*  A pigeon? A pigeon, dude. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1756.0s)]
*  He'll give them... [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1759.0s)]
*  That sounds cruel. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1761.0s)]
*  I said the same thing when I was talking. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1763.0s)]
*  Isn't life hard enough as a pigeon? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1765.0s)]
*  Yeah. So he'll get pigeons who, you know, they live in these cages and he'll give them the option to play a game where they every other pack, they get, say, 15 units of food. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1767.0s)]
*  So pack no food, pack 15 units of food. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1779.0s)]
*  Then they have an option to play a second game. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1783.0s)]
*  And this second game is very much a gambling game in that they get food about every fifth pack, but it's random. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1785.0s)]
*  Right. So you could go pack, pack, food, pack, pack. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1791.0s)]
*  The next one could be food, pack, pack, pack, pack. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1794.0s)]
*  Right. So it's just kind of like a slot machine and they get more food playing the gambling game. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1797.0s)]
*  They get 20 units. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1802.0s)]
*  If you do the math, it makes a lot more sense to play the game where you get every other right. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1803.0s)]
*  Every other pack is getting you food. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1809.0s)]
*  It adds up to a lot more food. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1811.0s)]
*  But what he finds is that the pigeons consistently play the slot machine game. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1813.0s)]
*  Ninety seven percent of pigeons will choose that game. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1819.0s)]
*  But they're not risking anything. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1821.0s)]
*  They're not risking anything. Right. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1823.0s)]
*  But it's still gambling. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1825.0s)]
*  They're still putting in the effort to have to play the game. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1826.0s)]
*  Yeah. But that seems obvious. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1829.0s)]
*  Like the rewards are greater. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1830.0s)]
*  So they know that if they just keep packing, it doesn't hurt to pack. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1832.0s)]
*  They're going to get a bigger supply of food. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1836.0s)]
*  They don't get a bigger supply though, because they'll get 15 every other pack versus 20 every fifth pack. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1838.0s)]
*  So if you put in 100 packs, you're going to get more food playing the one where it's you get food every other time. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1844.0s)]
*  Right. But it's still not gambling because the pigeon just sees a larger pile of food with the more packs. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1850.0s)]
*  So just wants the larger pile of food. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1855.0s)]
*  So it just keeps going. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1857.0s)]
*  It's not like they're risking all their food. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1858.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1860.0s)]
*  So I don't think it's a gambling thing. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1862.0s)]
*  Well, the larger pile of food comes from the predictable rewards. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. If you do every other. Right. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1868.0s)]
*  Yeah. Every other is how you get the biggest pile of food. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1872.0s)]
*  But you don't get the biggest pile in one jump, one dump. Right. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1874.0s)]
*  The one where it's every five, it's a larger quantity of food. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1878.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you get 20. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yeah. See, that's not gambling. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1883.0s)]
*  Why is it not gambling? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1884.0s)]
*  Because it's just more effort. It's more effort to get a bigger pile. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1885.0s)]
*  So he would argue that... [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1889.0s)]
*  They're just dumb. They just can't say, oh, it's every other one. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1891.0s)]
*  Well, all they see is that they're getting, you know, what are 15 units versus 20? Is that what it was? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1894.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1900.0s)]
*  All they know is 20 units. Like, oh, this one gives 20 units. Just keep pecking. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1901.0s)]
*  I don't think they're smart enough to figure that out. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1905.0s)]
*  I think they just like keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. 20. But there's not a risk. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1907.0s)]
*  So here's what I'll tell you. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1912.0s)]
*  He would argue and a lot of biologists would. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1913.0s)]
*  They would say, you know, there's this theory called the optimal foraging theory. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1916.0s)]
*  It says that animals will expend the least amount of energy to get the most amount of food. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1919.0s)]
*  All right. So over time, they're expending a lot less energy to get more food. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1923.0s)]
*  And so here's where it gets interesting, though, is that to sort of bring it back to why do people fall into this, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1928.0s)]
*  why would someone bet their entire fortune on a roulette wheel or whatever, is that when he will put pigeons in a sort of wild environment. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1937.0s)]
*  So where he keeps them is in these pigeon cages where they kind of live alone. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1947.0s)]
*  It's a basic cage. When he puts them in a cage that mimics the wild. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1951.0s)]
*  So it's this giant cage that has like roosts. It's got cliffs. It's got other pigeons. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1956.0s)]
*  It's very much like they would have to live in the wild. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1961.0s)]
*  And then he throws them back to choose a game. They start choosing the optimal game. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1964.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1970.0s)]
*  And so and you see that in many animals where they do these sorts of studies, like rats. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1972.0s)]
*  Well, that's the cocaine rat thing, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just like that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1978.0s)]
*  Yeah. For people who don't know that study, what they call it Rat Park. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1983.0s)]
*  So they did a study where they put rats in this very sterile environment, laboratory environment, bright lights, no toys, no nothing. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1987.0s)]
*  And they gave them the option of water or water with cocaine. And they always took the water with cocaine. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=1997.0s)]
*  They just kept taking the water with cocaine. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2003.0s)]
*  But then when they put them in Rat Park, which is a much larger thing with a lot of toys and things to do and a lot of places to run around, they didn't do that. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2005.0s)]
*  They just drank the water. Right. And that but that makes sense. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2014.0s)]
*  It's like they're fucking living in hell. And the cocaine water is the only thing that gives them any good feeling. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2018.0s)]
*  They just keep going back to that good feeling. But when you give them a normal natural environment where they can just exist, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2025.0s)]
*  I wonder if that's the case with people that live like, say, a subsistence lifestyle. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2031.0s)]
*  If they have access to something like heroin or cocaine, I wonder if they would just ignore it because they get this sort of very natural environment that is sort of programmed into our lives, program into our DNA. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2037.0s)]
*  People that live a subsistence lifestyle are unusually healthy. I'm sure you've seen. Have you seen Werner Herzog's documentary Happy People? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2054.0s)]
*  I don't think I've seen that one. No, it's great. It's Happy People, Life and the Taiga. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2063.0s)]
*  And it's about these trappers who live in Siberia. And there's very low instances of mental health issues, very low instances of, you know, all sorts of problems. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2067.0s)]
*  And that society just has ubiquitous in their world. These people are very happy and they get by. They just get by. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2080.0s)]
*  I mean, they have snowmobiles and dogs and they hunt and they trap and they fish and they just get by and they work every day. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2089.0s)]
*  And you have to work. The only way to live is to eat. The only way to eat is to work. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2097.0s)]
*  And so everybody does everything that they can. And they're all happy. It's very weird. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2101.0s)]
*  So that was this guy's theory. He said there's another theory, I think it's called the optimal stimulation theory. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2107.0s)]
*  Basically says that humans and animals need a certain level of stimulation in their life or else they start seeking it from other things. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2114.0s)]
*  Yes. So if you think about the context of how humans came up, I mean, it was very, sort of like the people you talk about on the Taiga, right? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2124.0s)]
*  They have you got to work all day. You're outside a lot. You're doing tasks that involve your mind and your body. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2133.0s)]
*  Like it's a full on effort to survive. You're also in sort of closer knit communities, all these different things. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2140.0s)]
*  And today we don't have that quite as much. And so his theory is that when you don't have enough stimulation in your life or meaning from other places, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2146.0s)]
*  humans tend to start to look for it in other ways. We gamble. We spend a lot of time on the Internet. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2156.0s)]
*  We buy a lot of stuff. So we start searching for it somewhere else. And those ways can often be counterproductive in the long run when you overdo them. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2163.0s)]
*  Yeah. Totally makes sense. And also, you know, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about this yesterday. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2173.0s)]
*  We were talking about how complex the human mind is and how complex life and society is. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2180.0s)]
*  But yet there's no real management book. Like there's no real there's no document that shows you this is the optimal way to exist. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2187.0s)]
*  And these are the pitfalls of existing other ways that, you know, you have these human reward systems built in and they can be hijacked [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2200.0s)]
*  by these various things. And this is the way the human body and the human mind exist optimally. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2209.0s)]
*  And for whatever reason, there's no real structure that people can follow that's universally agreed upon. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2217.0s)]
*  You know, like if you like, say, if you're a mechanic, right, and you're working on an engine like it's there's very clear documents that show you like [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2225.0s)]
*  these are the pistons. This is the spark plug. This is the carburetor. If it's not clean, it'll do this. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2237.0s)]
*  This is the problem with the gas line. And you have to fit it this way and that way. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2243.0s)]
*  And so you do it all right. And then it starts up and it works. And you can fix things that way and you can build things that way. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2248.0s)]
*  We don't really have that for the most complex thing that we're aware of, which is human existence. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2254.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. That's because it is so complex. It's so complex. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2261.0s)]
*  It's so complex. It's and technology also changes very fast. So technology is probably great in many ways. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2265.0s)]
*  It's a result of progress, right? It's kept us let us to live longer. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2275.0s)]
*  Allowed me to fly from Vegas to Austin in two hours instead of, you know, getting the old wagon train out and be like, yeah, I'll see you in like six months. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2280.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. How long would that be by wagon train? And it's pretty crazy. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2289.0s)]
*  But I don't think we've necessarily kept up with it. I mean, our hardware doesn't change that fast. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2295.0s)]
*  Right. Software, you know. And so I think a lot of the problems that we see today are often a result of us living as almost sort of ancient [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2301.0s)]
*  creatures in a very new, modern, changing world and trying to navigate that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2309.0s)]
*  That's what scares me about this seemingly inevitable connection with humans and technology is that I think what we're going to do is integrate with technology [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2314.0s)]
*  to avoid all the problems that we have existing in this modern world with this ancient hardware and that we're going to adjust our hardware. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2325.0s)]
*  And that the scene it seems to me that this is inevitable. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2334.0s)]
*  It seems to me that this is inevitable. It seems to me this is just where we're going and that humans are going to be some sort of cyborg type thing that we're. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2337.0s)]
*  And also with the invention of AI and, you know, I'm sure you're paying attention all this chat GPT stuff and that and deep fakes. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2345.0s)]
*  There's got so many deep fakes. People keep sending me commercials that I've never done for, you know, penis enhancements and, you know, all these different things. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2354.0s)]
*  And it's my voice. Yeah. And it's my lips moving and it shows me talking about how great these products are. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2363.0s)]
*  And then I never even heard of them. Yeah. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2370.0s)]
*  We're just starting to be able to fake things like that. We're on a consumer model like someone can just buy the software and put it together. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2374.0s)]
*  And, you know, and now AI can make literal films. So, I mean, at one point in time right now, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2381.0s)]
*  there's kind of like the uncanny valley in some ways where you can kind of see the difference between what's real and what's not really and kind of like, it looks fake. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2389.0s)]
*  How long before it like UFO footage? Great example. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2395.0s)]
*  Jeremy Cornbell, who's like the premier UFO researcher with George Knapp, you know, every now and then I'll find something online. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2399.0s)]
*  I'll send it to him. It's like, oh, that's bullshit, dude. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2407.0s)]
*  Like this, this is what they did and you can see it. This is how and this is why. And like, oh, OK. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2409.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of that a lot of big stuff and it's hard. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2416.0s)]
*  It's hard to know. It's hard to know what's real and what's fake. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2420.0s)]
*  And we kind of can tell now. But will we in 20 years? I bet no. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2422.0s)]
*  No, and I could be five years. Yeah, it might not. I'm being very generous. Yeah, sure. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2428.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's five months. I mean, it's weird. Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2432.0s)]
*  And I think we naturally gravitate to the technology, right? Everyone adopts it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2436.0s)]
*  And then it just it's just a part of life. Yeah, it's just a part of life. You just sort of fall into it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2442.0s)]
*  Yeah. And oftentimes you get punished if you're not using the technology, even though it might be bad for you in the long run. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2446.0s)]
*  Yeah. So think about something like trying to keep, say, a teenager off of social media. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2453.0s)]
*  We know it's probably not a great place for them to hang out a ton. Right. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2458.0s)]
*  And yet, if they're not on it, their life suffers. Yeah. Right. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2462.0s)]
*  Because they get they're not as dialed in socially. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2467.0s)]
*  And for teenagers, being social is very important due to how the brain is changing at the time. Right. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2470.0s)]
*  But even think about work, especially with how work, the nature of work has changed after covid with more people working from home. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2474.0s)]
*  If you don't want to be stuck on email all day, it's like, I totally get that. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2482.0s)]
*  But now if you decide, well, I'm not going to check my email during these times because it drives me insane. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2487.0s)]
*  Now you're a negligent employee. So you effectively have to adopt the technology to live in the system. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2492.0s)]
*  And then the system starts to sort of govern your actions. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2498.0s)]
*  I read an article about a woman who was fired and she met all of her productivity goals. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2501.0s)]
*  She was working remotely. But the company detected that she hadn't clicked enough on her computer. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2507.0s)]
*  She hadn't hit enough keystrokes. She hadn't moved her mouse enough. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2515.0s)]
*  And I think there was also an issue with the amount of time she spent in front of the computer that it wasn't enough. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2520.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, she met all of her goals. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2525.0s)]
*  So like how many people are just in front of an office where they're not checking in a cubicle, just bullshitting, probably listening to this podcast right now. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2527.0s)]
*  Enjoy. Enjoy. And you know, they're OK. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2536.0s)]
*  They're OK because they are in front of that computer. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2540.0s)]
*  And as long as they move their cursor around and do things and and I mean, they could be listening to this podcast on on their AirPods while they're also fucking around and doing all these other things as long as they spend. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2542.0s)]
*  And they might not be as productive, but they are doing the thing that the algorithm wants them to do. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2556.0s)]
*  This lady got fired. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2563.0s)]
*  Maybe she doesn't need to work as much to meet the productivity goals you set for her, but she's a good employee. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2565.0s)]
*  If you set a productivity goal for an employee, say, hey, we need to get X amount of units of work done by Friday and she does it. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2572.0s)]
*  Didn't she do her job like if she can do her job in 31 hours and the average person needs 44, isn't she a better employee? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2580.0s)]
*  Yes, she's more productive. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2589.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's better. Right. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2590.0s)]
*  Does she have to be clicking on things constantly? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2592.0s)]
*  And it's kind of crazy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2594.0s)]
*  This lady got fired like that's why it makes me wonder. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2596.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's some other factors, but maybe not. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2600.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just as simple as like they're just following numbers and that's how they hire and fire people. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2603.0s)]
*  Well, the numbers are really interesting because they're not really that old. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2608.0s)]
*  You know, numbers are maybe ten thousand years old. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2612.0s)]
*  There's still tribes in the Amazon. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2616.0s)]
*  There's a tribe called the Paraha who they still don't have numbers. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2618.0s)]
*  They can discriminate between one, two and three. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2622.0s)]
*  You go above that and it's either small, medium or large. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2624.0s)]
*  And that's probably how humans thought of quantities for most of time. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2627.0s)]
*  So if they catch a bunch of fish, they can't say how many fish they have 30 people in their village. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2630.0s)]
*  This is the story I just read to the article. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2635.0s)]
*  There's a little bit of both both sides on this story. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2636.0s)]
*  Oh, she's Australian. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2640.0s)]
*  They have wild rules over there. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2642.0s)]
*  They had complaints about her missing stuff and doing work. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2643.0s)]
*  And then she was saying this is all bullshit and they had evidence of her doing misconduct in their words. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2645.0s)]
*  So it's a both side story. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2652.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. OK. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2654.0s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2656.0s)]
*  That makes more sense. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2657.0s)]
*  So plus she's very pretty in that picture. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2659.0s)]
*  Maybe she's like trying to be an influencer. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2663.0s)]
*  Maybe they factored that in. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2665.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2666.0s)]
*  You know, it seems like she's using a filter. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2668.0s)]
*  That's another weird thing, right? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2670.0s)]
*  Filters. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2671.0s)]
*  Like how many people are just using filters? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2672.0s)]
*  Where I see pictures of like a friend of mine with his wife and the wife is using a filter. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2674.0s)]
*  And I know my friend doesn't look like that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2680.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2683.0s)]
*  You know, but he's with her and she's got the filter on like, hey, bro, did you go back in time? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2684.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2689.0s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2691.0s)]
*  You look like you're 15 years younger. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2692.0s)]
*  Just get back from Hawaii. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2693.0s)]
*  You're exceedingly tan in that photo. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2695.0s)]
*  You look fantastic. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2696.0s)]
*  What are you doing? Tell me about your diet. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2698.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I can kind of bend reality. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2700.0s)]
*  And to get back to numbers is that once we invent numbers, it starts to really change how humans behave. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2702.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2712.0s)]
*  Especially with measurement because that provides an element of sort of certainty. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2713.0s)]
*  So in the case of that employee, it's like someone somewhere with a clipboard goes, well, a good employee has 20 clicks per hour. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2719.0s)]
*  And then they just go down the thing and go, oh, well, this person had 19. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2727.0s)]
*  We got to can her. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2730.0s)]
*  So we're measuring by a random number instead of saying, did this person do the job we want the way that we want them to? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2732.0s)]
*  What is the outcome of the task we're trying to do and focusing on the actual goal, which is to make money for a company? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2739.0s)]
*  Well, it seems like in this story, it's kind of more more to it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2747.0s)]
*  But that's always the case. Right. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2750.0s)]
*  If someone makes an accusation against a company firing them, you know, it's like I was the best employee ever. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2751.0s)]
*  And I didn't do anything. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2756.0s)]
*  Nobody ever says I kind of fucked off a little, but I think I was good enough to keep the job. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2757.0s)]
*  Right. Nobody ever says that. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2762.0s)]
*  Everybody's always like, I was perfect. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2764.0s)]
*  And my boss is a tyrant in the work environment is toxic. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2766.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2769.0s)]
*  No one takes personal responsibility. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yeah. That kind of shit. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2772.0s)]
*  No. Twitter is a good example of how putting numbers on things can change our behavior and why we do what we do. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2774.0s)]
*  So here's the example is that and I learned about this from a guy whose name is T Nguyen. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2783.0s)]
*  So it's T H I N G U Y E N. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2788.0s)]
*  He's a philosopher at the University of Utah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2791.0s)]
*  When you start to measure Twitter via likes and retweets and that sorts of things, that changes what how you use Twitter. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2795.0s)]
*  So Twitter is now the platform formerly known as Twitter is supposed to be billed as a place for discussion. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2805.0s)]
*  Right. And so then you ask yourself, OK, well, what are the goals of a discussion? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2814.0s)]
*  And the answer is like, well, there's like a fucking lot of goals behind this discussion. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2818.0s)]
*  It could be to empathize. It could be to understand someone. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2824.0s)]
*  It could be to push back on them. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2826.0s)]
*  There's all these things that can come out of a discussion, all these possible goals. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2828.0s)]
*  But when you start to put numbers behind that in the form of likes of retweets of whatever it is, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2831.0s)]
*  people start to tweet in a way that scores likes and retweets. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2839.0s)]
*  And that is a different goal than is discussion. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2845.0s)]
*  It's often at odds with that. So like what does well on Twitter? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2848.0s)]
*  It's calling someone a dickhead. It's trying to dunk on someone. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2851.0s)]
*  It's trying to say something outlandish or then something in a way that incites outrage. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2854.0s)]
*  Right. And that totally changes the point of a discussion. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2859.0s)]
*  Right. And this guy noticed it in himself because he's a philosopher. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2862.0s)]
*  So his job is basically to think all day. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2868.0s)]
*  He goes, you know, the first time I had a tweet go viral, it was like, oh, my God, that was awesome. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2871.0s)]
*  And then he found himself when he would have these sort of philosophical thoughts. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2877.0s)]
*  Instead of going into this really deep zone that he'd usually have to go into to understand it, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2881.0s)]
*  he started finding himself going, how can I put this into like a 140 character tweet that will really do well? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2887.0s)]
*  Right. And that changes. That changes how he thinks and what he does. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2893.0s)]
*  And you see this. I mean, this isn't just in social media. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2897.0s)]
*  This is in so many different systems where we put numbers behind something. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2900.0s)]
*  It starts to change people's goal in a way that changes their behavior. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2905.0s)]
*  But the goal of scoring numbers is often different from the original goal of the behavior. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2909.0s)]
*  You know, this discussion actually came up in the hunting world recently because I was having a conversation with a friend of mine. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2915.0s)]
*  There's two goals in what one of the things that people want when they hunt is they want to get a mature animal for a bunch of reasons. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2922.0s)]
*  One reason is that the mature animal say if you get excuse me, if you get like a seven year old mule deer, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2935.0s)]
*  that is a deer that has spread its genes. It's done its job in the reproductive system. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2943.0s)]
*  It's passed on its DNA. And this is an old mature deer. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2950.0s)]
*  Also, it's more of a challenge because this is a wiser deer. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2954.0s)]
*  This is a deer that has probably experienced hunters before. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2959.0s)]
*  Most certainly has experienced mountain lions and bears and other predators. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2963.0s)]
*  And so the goal is ethically and morally. That's the animal that you should choose to try to hunt. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2968.0s)]
*  Now, there's numbers that are involved now. So with deer, it's the size of the antler and the magic number is 200. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2975.0s)]
*  If you can get a 200 inch mule deer, that is a very, very rare deer. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2984.0s)]
*  That is a deer that has lived for a long time. It has superior genetics. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2990.0s)]
*  It has this very big. Have you ever seen a 200 inch mule deer on the hoof? Yeah, they're giant. They're giant. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=2996.0s)]
*  And it's so impressive. So this guy had shot a mule deer, this beautiful, mature mule deer, but it scored one ninety four. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3002.0s)]
*  It didn't score 200. And he was like, well, it's just a deer, just another buck. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3012.0s)]
*  And my friend was furious. He's like, this is a bastardization of everything that hunting is supposed to stand for. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3017.0s)]
*  Like hunting is supposed to stand for. This is an ethical way to acquire your food. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3024.0s)]
*  This is the best wild protein that you can get. It's the healthiest for you. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3030.0s)]
*  It's also an important thing to manage the population numbers of these animals so that they don't get overpopulated, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3035.0s)]
*  which leads to the spread of diseases like CWZ and chronic wasting and all these different things that people attribute to overpopulation of car accidents, all these different things. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3042.0s)]
*  And but the number thing got in people's heads. And this guy was very happy with his deer until he found out it was one ninety four and not 200. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3052.0s)]
*  Because it's like it's impossible to tell when you're looking through binoculars. You're looking through binoculars, you go, that is a giant mule deer. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3061.0s)]
*  That's what I want to get. But he was unsatisfied because it came up in the. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3068.0s)]
*  So the overall score, the way they do it, it's kind of complicated. They measure the width of the base. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3073.0s)]
*  They measure the length of the tines of the antlers, the width of how far they're apart and all that stuff gets factored together and it comes up with a score. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3078.0s)]
*  And his score was six inches short and he was bummed out, which is just nuts. It's crazy. It's weird. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3086.0s)]
*  Right. So his goal, because we put the number on that, is simply just to get 200 or over. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3092.0s)]
*  Right. To your point where you just talked about, you know, why do we hunt? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3096.0s)]
*  There's all these really complex but far more valuable and meaningful reasons that we go out into hunt. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3099.0s)]
*  But if you get captured by this number, that changes your experience in a way that is probably not a good thing. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3106.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you saw this in the wine world when Robert Parker started the Wine Advocate. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3112.0s)]
*  I think this was in the early 80s or 70s. So this guy is Robert Parker's this guy from Maryland. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3118.0s)]
*  He kind of grew up in the backwoods. He's just a normal dude. He likes wine, but he thinks all this snobby language around wine, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3125.0s)]
*  like it's keeping people who would otherwise enjoy it from from drinking it. So it's a good intent. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3132.0s)]
*  And so what he decides is I'm going to start, I'm going to start a magazine. I'm going to start giving wines a score from 50 to 100. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3138.0s)]
*  So when he starts this, the magazine takes off because now the average consumer can know. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3146.0s)]
*  Well, this is an 80. This is a 90. The 90s better. I'm buying that. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3154.0s)]
*  Now, here's the thing, though, is that it is Parker who's testing the wines and he's also having to test them alone, not with food. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3159.0s)]
*  Now, one of the main reasons you drink wine is to drink with food because it changes as you drink it. Right. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3169.0s)]
*  But his scoring system, if a wine scores really well, those bottles fly off the shelf. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3175.0s)]
*  Whereas the ones who don't get quite as good of a store score, they collect dust. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3181.0s)]
*  So what the wine industry does is they go, OK, well, if we want to sell a lot of wine, we got to produce bottles that get a good score from Robert Parker. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3186.0s)]
*  So they change how they make wines to suit his palate. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3196.0s)]
*  Now, if you don't have Robert Parker's palate, you don't like what he likes. Like, this is meaningless to you. Right. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3201.0s)]
*  So it's one person? One person. And then you started to see, I mean, his industry and empire grew. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3206.0s)]
*  You start to see a lot of other wine rating places pop up that mimic it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3211.0s)]
*  But it's the same with any review. Right. If you put a number on it, it's kind of this arbitrary thing that someone has to make up. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3216.0s)]
*  And it's often done in a vacuum. And it's very, very subjective. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3223.0s)]
*  But we pretend like it's objective and then we behave like it means something. Right. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3227.0s)]
*  Yeah. I have a very good friend who's a wine connoisseur, like a real wine connoisseur. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3231.0s)]
*  Like he has this big wine cellar in his home. You go in and it's filled with all this crazy wine. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3236.0s)]
*  And he knows everything about wine. He can tell you what the good years were and where the vineyards were and where the things come out of. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3243.0s)]
*  And he had a birthday. And so he invites me to this wine pairing dinner on his birthday. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3251.0s)]
*  And it was great. The food was great. The wine was great. But it was so bizarre because they bring these flights of wine and then everyone tests the wine. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3259.0s)]
*  People are recording themselves doing this. They have little tape recorders and they're talking about the tannins and the oaky this and the that. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3268.0s)]
*  And then someone opens up that I think this one's corked. This one's corked. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3277.0s)]
*  And they're testing. Yes, I believe this one's corked. I'm like, this one's my favorite. I don't even understand what's going on here. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3281.0s)]
*  And there was this one guy that was there that was being heralded as this big wine expert and they would refer to him. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3286.0s)]
*  Well, cut to years later, that guy gets arrested and he winds up doing 10 years in jail for making fake wine. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3294.0s)]
*  And there's a documentary on it. The documentary is called Sour Grapes. And it's amazing documentary. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3303.0s)]
*  I haven't seen. I've seen it pop up now. I'm going to watch it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3310.0s)]
*  It's very, very interesting because it plays on this very strange thing that people have to want the rarest, most unique. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3313.0s)]
*  And what this guy did was he started. Well, he started buying wine. That's the first thing he did. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3324.0s)]
*  He would go to these auctions. And, you know, I don't know if you've ever seen any of those wine auctions, but they're super bizarre. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3330.0s)]
*  Like people are spending ungodly amounts of wine, money on wine, like ancient bottles and very rare bottles. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3338.0s)]
*  And so this guy's buying all this wine. So he is established as this connoisseur. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3346.0s)]
*  And then what he's doing is he's going to his home and he's aging these labels and he's creating labels and he starts auctioning off. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3351.0s)]
*  And I think is it Sotheby's or Christie's? Someone's involved in this auction that kind of should know that this is bullshit. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3362.0s)]
*  Like they haven't checked. And so one man from one vineyard who's this very famous family vineyard sees bottles of his company's wine for sale. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3371.0s)]
*  And he says, we never made a magnum that year. We never made that bottle of wine. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3384.0s)]
*  Like that is not real. And that, you know, is going for insane amounts of money. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3389.0s)]
*  And so then they start doing an investigation and they find out that this guy has made and sold thousands of bottles of fake old wine, including to the Koch brothers. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3393.0s)]
*  And this is where he got fucked. This is where he did. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3406.0s)]
*  He sold the Koch brothers like millions of dollars worth of wine. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3409.0s)]
*  And these guys are just super ballers with an unlimited amount of money. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3412.0s)]
*  And they were buying like Lincoln's bottle of wine, like Thomas Jefferson's bottle, like that kind of crazy shit. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3417.0s)]
*  And people are saying, no, that's not even it's handwriting. That's not this is not real. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3423.0s)]
*  So these guys were they got duped. And so then they opened the investigation and they find this guy's house and they find the bottles of wine. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3427.0s)]
*  He was buying old bottles and re corking them and like making the labels dirty and doing all this different shit. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3434.0s)]
*  But it's so interesting because one of the guys in the film is like this was a bottle that he sold me was legit because the guy was selling legit wine too. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3440.0s)]
*  He's like, this one's legit. And they're drinking. You can tell. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3451.0s)]
*  And this other guy comes on. Let me try that. He's like, this is garbage. This wine's garbage. This is fake. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3454.0s)]
*  It doesn't have the complexity. It doesn't have the robustness. It doesn't have the. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3458.0s)]
*  And these other guys are like also supposedly experts. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3462.0s)]
*  What what are you guys tasting? What is going on here? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3467.0s)]
*  Like what is this weird thing that you're chasing that the difference is so subtle? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3471.0s)]
*  It's not even the difference between Coke and Pepsi. You know, it's so subtle. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3476.0s)]
*  But yet it's a difference between a bottle of wine that's worth fifty bucks, a hundred bucks and forty thousand. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3480.0s)]
*  And no one knows. No one can tell. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3487.0s)]
*  And this guy had apparently, according to my friend, such a palette that he could experiment by taking these various much more inexpensive wines, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3491.0s)]
*  combining them in very specific ratios and recreate something that was very similar. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3501.0s)]
*  And as long as you got it in this bottle and as long as you looked at it as a oh, is it Bolger Bobon from 74? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3509.0s)]
*  And you thought you were getting the real shit. And so then there's the placebo effect, right? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3516.0s)]
*  You're you're tasting it and you're imagining it. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3521.0s)]
*  This is rich, robust wine that very few people can appreciate. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3524.0s)]
*  And then you're all appreciating this one. Meanwhile, this guy's laughing his ass off because he made it in his fucking Century City house. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3528.0s)]
*  I mean, he's like nuts. You got it in the bathtub. Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3535.0s)]
*  I mean, literally, see if you can get some clips out of that. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3539.0s)]
*  There was actually a study and it was conducted, I think, at a university in France that has a good wine department. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3542.0s)]
*  The researchers, they got a bottle that was scored really high and a bottle that was scored low. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3548.0s)]
*  And they got this group of students and without them knowing, they switched the labels. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3555.0s)]
*  So they so the bad bottle has the nice label on it and vice versa. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3560.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they served it out and they had them talk about it and rated and do all these things. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3565.0s)]
*  And you know where I'm going with this? The students who think that the the terrible bottle is good, they give it all this like, oh, it's got a deep blah, blah, blah. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3570.0s)]
*  You know, they're using all the tannins and all the word salad, you know. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3580.0s)]
*  And then with the bottle that was actually expensive and highly rated that they thought was bad, they, you know, yeah, this is cat piss. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3583.0s)]
*  And so and so expectations often to your point about the placebo effect, they shape how you experience something as well. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3590.0s)]
*  It's that world is so strange because the difference between a very good glass of wine and a good glass of wine is so big. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3600.0s)]
*  I was with my friend Mark once we were in Florida and we were eating at this Italian restaurant and it was a great restaurant. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3609.0s)]
*  And I said, let's get a crazy bottle one. Let's get a fucking really nice bottle one. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3616.0s)]
*  And I've never had like a thousand dollar bottle of wine. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3620.0s)]
*  So we bought this bottle of wine from, you know, 1980 or whatever the fuck it was. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3624.0s)]
*  And it was not good. It was OK. It was OK. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3628.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was like it was OK. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3632.0s)]
*  And then we were I said, OK, let's flip it up because there's quite a few people at the table. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3635.0s)]
*  I said, let's flip it up and let's get our next bottle. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3639.0s)]
*  Let's get like a 90 dollar bottle one. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3642.0s)]
*  And we're both like, this is better. This one's better. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3644.0s)]
*  This is I don't know what I'm drinking. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3647.0s)]
*  I don't know what I just know what this tastes like. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3650.0s)]
*  Nice wine. Yeah. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3652.0s)]
*  So here it's so here's how this guy did this. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3654.0s)]
*  So he would take these bottles and sit them in water. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3658.0s)]
*  And, you know, he had all these labels and all these different things. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3662.0s)]
*  And he would get bottles from, you know, like used bottles, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3666.0s)]
*  like bottles of legitimate wine that he had already, you know, drank. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3669.0s)]
*  You're not shitting that he's literally doing this in some random apartment. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3674.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's doing it in his house. Yeah. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3677.0s)]
*  I mean, look, he's got the windows taped up so no one could see him doing it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3680.0s)]
*  He's got fucking he's got aluminum foil in the windows like he's doing heroin in there. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3683.0s)]
*  It's like you cooking meth in there. Yeah. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3687.0s)]
*  Oh, man, I'm just pulling some labels off some old wine bottles. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3689.0s)]
*  So at the end of this documentary, they wind up destroying thousands of bottles of this wine. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3691.0s)]
*  And it's it's really bonkers because like it's he could have sold that wine for who knows how much money. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3696.0s)]
*  And so see, see there he's got all those labels that he had sitting there. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3702.0s)]
*  That was the guy that got duped. And this is the guy that duped him. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3705.0s)]
*  That guy with the glasses on. He was the one who's like, this one's a real one. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3708.0s)]
*  And the other one extra is like, bitch, this is fake as fuck. Interesting. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3711.0s)]
*  And I don't even know how they know or if they really do know. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3715.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm such a I'm such I don't know anything about wine. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3718.0s)]
*  I just like I just say, what's a good wine? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3722.0s)]
*  You know, when I go to a restaurant, pick one out for me. That's good. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3725.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand. Or I call my friend who is a legit expert and I'll say, tell me a good. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3728.0s)]
*  And he's usually right. I mean, oh, he's always right. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3732.0s)]
*  But what does that mean? What does it mean? I mean, am I going to notice a difference, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3735.0s)]
*  especially two glasses in when you're eating a steak? No. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3738.0s)]
*  As long as it doesn't taste terrible to it's a nice wine. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3740.0s)]
*  I don't. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not super into that world either. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3743.0s)]
*  I just gotten so interested in this idea of numbers and having the sort of certainty of quantification changing our behavior in strange ways that I ended up down that rabbit hole. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3746.0s)]
*  Another good example would be some a professor. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3756.0s)]
*  Why do you go to college? A lot of reasons, right? Right. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3760.0s)]
*  You want to acquire information. You also want to make friends. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3764.0s)]
*  You want to learn how to get your shit together, to turn things in on time, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3767.0s)]
*  to get on a schedule that you're going to need when you go out into the world to get a job. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3771.0s)]
*  All these different things. Right. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3775.0s)]
*  But what are my students most obsessed about? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3777.0s)]
*  Their GPA. And that's totally that's very different. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3780.0s)]
*  And I found in my experience as a professor that it's often not the students who are straight A's who are the best because those students tend to be a little more robotic. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3785.0s)]
*  The students that are best tend to be in the B plus A minus. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3794.0s)]
*  So this is because they might have they might be working 40 hours a week along with that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3798.0s)]
*  So this suggests they're pretty gritty. They're a hustler or they might be tooth free thinking. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3802.0s)]
*  Right. The type of students where I say, hey, do the assignment this way and they do it a different and they're just going, oh, well, I thought I could do it this way and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3806.0s)]
*  You know, and they also don't tend to ask about their grades. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3814.0s)]
*  Now, the reason that we use grades is simply because it makes the lives of administrators much easier. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3819.0s)]
*  Right. If you need to compare students quickly, if you're sending people through the system, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3824.0s)]
*  you can put a number on it and you can kind of rank people. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3830.0s)]
*  But it doesn't necessarily reflect whether this person has accomplished all these different things, why you would want to go to college. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3832.0s)]
*  Yeah. And what do you go into college for? Are you going to college to get a good job? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3839.0s)]
*  And if you have a high GPA, wouldn't that make you more likely to be hired? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3844.0s)]
*  So there's that. Yeah. Is that little tricky thing? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3850.0s)]
*  Also with numbers, because it's also very hard to quantify whether or not a person is going to be productive. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3853.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess you meet with them and then you want to find out how they are socially. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3859.0s)]
*  You know, like when you talk to them, are they easy to communicate with? Are they gregarious? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3865.0s)]
*  They seem like a good person that would be a nice person to have around the office because they would make a pleasant work environment. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3872.0s)]
*  And that would also help things more productive, become more productive. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3880.0s)]
*  It's like I get why there would be numbers, but it is a strange thing that humans are obsessed with numbers. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3884.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier with certainty. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3892.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you put a number on something, you can be certain what it is that you've done the right thing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3895.0s)]
*  But the reality is, is that all these metrics, there's so much gray that goes into them. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3899.0s)]
*  But when we see them, we think they're black and white. Yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3903.0s)]
*  And that can, you know, obviously we need numbers. Our world runs on them. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3906.0s)]
*  But I also think we need to be skeptical that they tell the absolute truth. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3910.0s)]
*  And I think we need to be aware of the fact that they can change our behaviors in such a way that we miss sort of these greater purposes of why we're doing the things that we do. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3914.0s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of people don't know why they do. They just want to be successful, right? Yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3924.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't. It's very hard. If you think about uncertainty, right? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3930.0s)]
*  And this is the thing that you have when you're in college or this is the thing you have when you're embarking upon a risky career. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3935.0s)]
*  Like there's so much uncertainty. Is this going to work for me? Am I going to make it? Is it going to happen? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3942.0s)]
*  Or am I going to be left out like everybody? Am I going to be one of the people that doesn't make it? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3948.0s)]
*  Am I going to be one of those sad stories like this person? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3953.0s)]
*  They just failed in life and they want to die in a heroin overdose. You know, like no one wants to be that guy. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3956.0s)]
*  So it's like, what do I have to do? And, you know, what what are the metrics that I have to achieve? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3963.0s)]
*  Like, what are the numbers? What's the thing that I have to do to show? Oh, I make a million dollars a year. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3968.0s)]
*  I'm a winner. You know, that's a thing. Totally. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3975.0s)]
*  Like if you are a millionaire, you could say, listen, I'm a millionaire. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3977.0s)]
*  Like, wow, you did it. You made it. Right. But that person might be fucking miserable. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3980.0s)]
*  So isn't the goal to be happy? Like maybe a person who makes 100 grand a year is, you know, they get their bills paid. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3986.0s)]
*  They live comfortably. They're happier. Yeah, they're better off. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3994.0s)]
*  They do what they actually enjoy doing for a living. And it's just not as profitable. Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=3998.0s)]
*  Like maybe that's a better goal. But we can't quantify that. Like how can I? I can't put happiness on a scale. Right. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4003.0s)]
*  I can't put like if you're a person like say you make knives, you make chef's knives and, you know, you're just making these beautiful, gorgeous knives. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4010.0s)]
*  And you get deep satisfaction out of this. But you're like fucking barely getting by. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4019.0s)]
*  You're paying your bills like but you're living kind of check to check. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4024.0s)]
*  And it's all about like selling the next knife. And OK, now we've got the mortgage paid and I got to keep making knives that I might be happier than some crazy person who's buying hundred thousand dollars a wine because that person doesn't even know what's making them happy anymore. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4027.0s)]
*  Like they don't enjoy their job. They're just getting money so they can acquire these things. Right. Exactly. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4044.0s)]
*  You're just kind of chasing that next whatever it is that the purchase. Yeah. You know, the person that you've hooked up with, though, whatever it might be. Yeah. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4051.0s)]
*  And I do think to I do think that what people tend to chase and think is going to make them happy does tend to go tend to fall back into the evolutionary argument of like what did we need to survive? Right. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4060.0s)]
*  It was food. It was stuff. It was status. Influence over others. It was, you know, information. Even people really lean on on the smartest person or whatever. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4073.0s)]
*  But I don't think, you know, obviously having a certain amount of income correlates to happiness. But once you get above a certain level, kind of disappears. Yeah. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4083.0s)]
*  So I think it was in trying to remember the exact cut off of the years. It's somewhat irrelevant. But income rose in real dollars 50 percent from, say, 1979 to like 2005, whatever the years are. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4095.0s)]
*  But happiness didn't actually increase in the United States. So even though we got richer dollar for dollar with adjusted for inflation, happiness levels didn't seem to increase. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4109.0s)]
*  And to suggest that at a certain point, once you have your needs taken care of, you're probably going to be good to go. And in fact, probably chasing more of sort of these ephemeral things, you know, is not going to make you happy. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4121.0s)]
*  It creates anxiety. Creates anxiety. Part of it. So part of the book, I have a section on because the book overall looks at. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4135.0s)]
*  OK. Why are humans not good at moderation? What are the things that we are bad at moderating at? And how do we think about getting out of that cycle? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4142.0s)]
*  And so because I'm an investigative journalist, I go places for stories. Right. I'm going to go talk to experts. I'm going to go live with different groups are interesting. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4153.0s)]
*  So to get into this idea of happiness, I spent a week living with these Benedictine monks in the mountains of New Mexico. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4162.0s)]
*  So these guys Benedictine monk, it's an order of Catholicism. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4171.0s)]
*  So these guys, they live in an abbey. They all live together. They basically don't talk to each other. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4177.0s)]
*  There's only a handful of hours they can talk. And they also have to work every day. Four hours manual labor. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4184.0s)]
*  They have to go into the chapel to pray seven times a day. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4192.0s)]
*  And so despite having this really austere kind of hard life that demands a lot of them, when researchers look at their happiness levels and compare them to the general public, they're much higher. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4197.0s)]
*  And what are they looking for when they say happiness levels? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4210.0s)]
*  They're looking at self-reported status, life satisfaction scores. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4214.0s)]
*  So they basically ask him, how do you feel about this? How do you feel about this? And then they come up with a metric that they is basically what they think of as happiness. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4218.0s)]
*  Hmm. That's a weird one, because that you're you're getting a person who's completely isolated from the rest of the world. Right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4224.0s)]
*  So you're not compare they're not comparing themselves to other people. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4234.0s)]
*  And so like what they consider happiness, I wonder if they have people that are living different walks of life that they can compare to. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4239.0s)]
*  If maybe they would not have the same score, it's a great question. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4251.0s)]
*  You know, like they think they're happy, but maybe they would be happier if they could sleep till 10 a.m. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4257.0s)]
*  You know, maybe they would be happier if, you know, they could go on a trip every now and then they just go see Paris. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4262.0s)]
*  Maybe they would be happier if they had a car and they could just drive out to the mountains and just like sit on the top of a ridge and just look at the beautiful scenery. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4268.0s)]
*  They don't do that because they don't have a car. So maybe their self-reported happiness is incorrect. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4277.0s)]
*  Yeah, it could be or they could could be that you're to your point. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4281.0s)]
*  They could be happier. Yeah. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4285.0s)]
*  What I do think it suggests that you don't necessarily need all these things that we've been talking about to be happy. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4287.0s)]
*  Right. And a lot of times I think what makes people happy is not necessarily chasing the next item that sort of chase of like going to buy this thing. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4296.0s)]
*  I'm going to hit this amount of money. I'm going to do this. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4306.0s)]
*  It is finding some sort of higher purpose, trying to do the next right thing, however you interpret that. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4308.0s)]
*  And eventually people wind up finding themselves happy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4314.0s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. What is? Yeah. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4317.0s)]
*  It's like it's weird, right? Because you can't put it on a scale like you can tell if someone's overweight. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4321.0s)]
*  You can't tell if someone's happy. Right. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4327.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you, man, it was pretty funny because, you know, when I get there, I arrived during what's called the grand silence. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4329.0s)]
*  So this is a time when all speaking is forbidden, except in, you know, grave instances. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4336.0s)]
*  And apparently my arrival classified as a grave instance. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4341.0s)]
*  So the grave, the guy, you know, this this monk meets me and he kind of, you know, walks. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4345.0s)]
*  He's like, this is a chapel being there at three fifty four three fifty in the morning for this service. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4351.0s)]
*  And then here's where we eat breakfast. And by the way, don't for breakfast. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4357.0s)]
*  We don't sit. We don't talk. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4360.0s)]
*  We don't talk. So blah, blah, blah. And he takes me up to like the guest quarters. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4362.0s)]
*  And, you know, what do I do? One of the one of the rules is to not be lazy and to not be tiresome. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4365.0s)]
*  And of course, I sleep through the three fifty a.m. meeting in the chapel. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4370.0s)]
*  Right. But I make it down for breakfast. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4374.0s)]
*  And it was really fascinating living that way for a week. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4377.0s)]
*  I mean, I definitely I got a lot out of it and had some interesting conversations when we could talk and just watching the people live and interact. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4382.0s)]
*  I think it just opens up a lot of you go, oh, there's like different ways of viewing things. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4391.0s)]
*  And there's probably something I can learn from that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4396.0s)]
*  Am I going to be living in the monastery any time soon? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4398.0s)]
*  Like, hell no. But there's things we can learn from interacting with other people in the present who are different than us. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4401.0s)]
*  Yeah. Also, they're only interacting with the people that they're interacting with physically, which I think is a real issue with human beings. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4408.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about dunking on people on Twitter and that kind of stuff. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4417.0s)]
*  I don't do that. I've done it in the past. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4421.0s)]
*  But somewhere along the line, I realize that the energy that I'm putting out, if I'm being negative, that affects me, whether I realize it or not. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4425.0s)]
*  If I'm being mean and shitty to someone and trying to ruin their day, that affects me, whether I realize it or not. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4435.0s)]
*  It's not good for you. It's not healthy. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4441.0s)]
*  I don't want to do that in person. I don't want to look at a person in the eye and say mean things to them. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4444.0s)]
*  And I don't want to look at a person on a screen and say mean things to them. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4449.0s)]
*  I understand that there's a great pull to that because of the numbers. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4452.0s)]
*  Because if you do dunk on someone, you know, and say, well, what are you fucking do? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4456.0s)]
*  And then, ah, ha, ha. And all these people put memes and all these different things and you get 100,000 likes or whatever. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4461.0s)]
*  I don't I don't think that's good for you. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4468.0s)]
*  And I don't think you really get anything out of that other than the the the score. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4471.0s)]
*  It's not enhancing your life in any real way. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4476.0s)]
*  You know, you're just you're contributing to the negativity of the world. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4479.0s)]
*  And I think as fucking corny and as cliche as this sounds, and I've thought of it, I've especially thought of this after psychedelic experiences, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4483.0s)]
*  which have been some of the most profound life changing and perspective altering experiences I've ever had that that I have to think about overall good, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4493.0s)]
*  the overall good of what I'm doing. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4507.0s)]
*  Like what is over? I think a podcast is pretty easy for the most part, because for the most part, what we're doing is having a conversation. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4509.0s)]
*  And I think this one is very interesting to me. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4518.0s)]
*  And so I think it's probably going to be very interesting to other people. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4521.0s)]
*  And these subjects are very interesting and they stimulate your mind. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4523.0s)]
*  And I feel good about my work. I feel good about it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4527.0s)]
*  I feel like people come up to me. I love your podcast. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4529.0s)]
*  I'm like, thank you. I'm glad you enjoy it. I really like it. I like that. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4532.0s)]
*  I think I'm doing a good thing. I think I'm putting a good thing out there. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4535.0s)]
*  And I think it's so I feel good about it. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4538.0s)]
*  If I was using my podcast to tear people apart and tear things down and I mean, I do. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4540.0s)]
*  I criticize things that need to be criticized. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4547.0s)]
*  But I try to be fair and I try to be as overall net positive as possible. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4549.0s)]
*  And I think I'm going to try to do that more and more as time goes on. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4556.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to avoid even I mean, even this open criticism of people that deserve it. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4560.0s)]
*  I mean, I wonder how productive that really is. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4566.0s)]
*  I often think about it like should I just spend more time instead of doing that? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4570.0s)]
*  Instead of doing that on things that I'm just fascinated with. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4576.0s)]
*  And I think that would probably be better for me. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4579.0s)]
*  Probably create less people that are upset at me. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4582.0s)]
*  Create less people that are upset listening to it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4585.0s)]
*  And it's probably better overall, like the overall good of things. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4589.0s)]
*  So it's like if you're doing something or you're creating things like we're talking about knives, like chef's knives. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4593.0s)]
*  That's an overall positive thing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4599.0s)]
*  You are creating a thing that someone will use and they'll appreciate and enjoy. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4601.0s)]
*  It's an overall positive exchange. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4606.0s)]
*  And so I think the more overall positive exchanges you can create in your life, the better. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4609.0s)]
*  And it took me a long fucking time to figure that out. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4615.0s)]
*  It really took me until I started doing this podcast. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4619.0s)]
*  I mean, this podcast has been this insanely educational experience to me that I didn't expect to have. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4622.0s)]
*  I didn't expect to be educated. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4629.0s)]
*  I expected to just do it because it was a fun thing to do. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4632.0s)]
*  I used to like doing morning radio. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4635.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, I'll do my own fucking thing. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4637.0s)]
*  And it would be kind of like doing morning radio. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4640.0s)]
*  But then along the line, when I started having guests on and I started considering other people's perspectives [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4642.0s)]
*  and I started considering how I interact with those people and getting better at interacting with them [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4647.0s)]
*  and having some negative experiences and negative shows and negative interactions, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4650.0s)]
*  I realized like those don't make me feel good. Those feel like shit. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4656.0s)]
*  Like what do I have to do to not do that and create more positive experiences? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4659.0s)]
*  And as I've done that, the more I've done that, the better I've gotten at that, the happier I've been with what I do. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4666.0s)]
*  So what's the big takeaway if you had to sum it up from that experience? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4672.0s)]
*  I mean, we affect each other. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4676.0s)]
*  And if you're affecting each other in a negative way, you're not doing overall good. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4679.0s)]
*  But if you can affect people in a positive way, you are doing overall good. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4685.0s)]
*  And so I try to do that. I try to do like when we do podcasts that are fun, I try to make them like if I have comics on just let's just have a good time. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4689.0s)]
*  I don't want anybody to feel bad. I want everybody to have fun. Let's have a great time. Let's laugh. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4700.0s)]
*  I love comics in particular because we can shit on each other and it's funny. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4704.0s)]
*  Like like if a comic makes fun of me, it's funny to me, too. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4708.0s)]
*  Like it's I don't my feelings don't get hurt. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4712.0s)]
*  It's part of what we do to each other when we're alone, like comics in a green room are hilarious with each other. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4714.0s)]
*  We're just always shit because we're looking for things to make fun of. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4719.0s)]
*  And you can appreciate it. It's like if you're sparring and someone hits you with a jab like, oh, that was a good shot. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4722.0s)]
*  You're like, you got a drop my hand. Yep. Thank you. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4727.0s)]
*  You know, you're getting something out of that. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4730.0s)]
*  You're getting something out of the kind of verbal sparring, but it's all good natured and it's all fun. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4732.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, some people don't feel that way. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4737.0s)]
*  You can't take like comedian thinking and apply it to other people. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4740.0s)]
*  Some people get like super upset if you dunk on them. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4743.0s)]
*  But you're not trying to be so, you know, you have to learn how to not do that amongst regular people. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4748.0s)]
*  And I've made those mistakes, too. Yeah. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4753.0s)]
*  What I mean, one guy who's really helped me in my own life, he's helped a lot of people. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4756.0s)]
*  He said, you know, I think at the end of the day, of all the people I've talked to, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4760.0s)]
*  most people, they just want to be loved. Yes. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4764.0s)]
*  And they don't want to be alone. Yes. Yes. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4768.0s)]
*  They want to be loved. They don't want to be alone. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4771.0s)]
*  They want to enjoy their experience with other people. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4773.0s)]
*  And I think that even when you look at the are bad behaviors, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4776.0s)]
*  they usually provide some sort of short term benefit that often gets overlooked. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4781.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think people do things for bad reasons. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4787.0s)]
*  I think that people usually get something from any behavior they do. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4791.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean the behavior isn't maladaptive. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4795.0s)]
*  But usually in the short term, there is a benefit and a reason why they're doing the thing they're doing. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4798.0s)]
*  And it usually goes back to some sort of deeper reason. Right. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4804.0s)]
*  So the case would be a person who's an asshole. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4807.0s)]
*  It might be a defense mechanism because maybe they were raised by a parent who was terrible to them. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4810.0s)]
*  Right. And so they feel like they always need to be on the defensive. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4814.0s)]
*  And so when we walk in, you know, 20 years later, we go, that guy's a dickhead. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4817.0s)]
*  But really, it's like, no, he still just hasn't recovered from being a kid whose parent was a jerk to them. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4821.0s)]
*  Yes. And realizing that people are usually acting the way they're acting for a good reason, I think gives you space. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4826.0s)]
*  It gives you empathy and allows you to interact with others better in the world. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4834.0s)]
*  And that changes your own experience. Because if I look at the asshole and be like, hey, fuck that guy. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4840.0s)]
*  And that changes the rest of my day. Like, that's not a that's not good for me either. Right. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4846.0s)]
*  Right. I can just be like, yeah, well, you know, some people are that way and probably probably a reason for it. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4850.0s)]
*  And you have children. I don't have children. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4855.0s)]
*  No. One of the things that happened to me when I started real when you see someone go from being a baby to an adult, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4857.0s)]
*  you you think about human beings in a very different way. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4868.0s)]
*  I think about everyone I meet. I think of them as a baby. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4872.0s)]
*  Like, oh, this is a like if I meet some poor homeless person in front of a gas station. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4876.0s)]
*  When I was younger, I would look at that person and go, oh, fucking idiot. Get your shit together. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4883.0s)]
*  And now I look at that person like, what hand did life give you? Right. You were a baby. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4888.0s)]
*  This was there was this lady I saw recently and she had the most insanely bad posture, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4893.0s)]
*  maybe some like she had suffered an injury like a broken neck because her her head was like she was like very frail and very obviously addicted to drugs and dirty. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4898.0s)]
*  And her head was like hanging down like this so deeply that she couldn't barely look up to like ask for money. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4911.0s)]
*  And, you know, I just all I could think of was that that was someone's someone's little baby. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4921.0s)]
*  You know, you see some guy who's like sleeping on the corner of a street just covered in filth. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4928.0s)]
*  That was someone's little boy. That was a little woman gave birth to this little boy. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4935.0s)]
*  And they had, you know, all the potential in the world if they were in a different environment, if they were in a different if they had different genes, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4941.0s)]
*  if they were in different neighborhood, if they had different parents, if they had different experiences. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4949.0s)]
*  But now here I find them in worst case scenario on the ground, you know, being ignored. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4954.0s)]
*  People are passing them by. No one cares about them. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4960.0s)]
*  You know, it's a testament to the health of a society when you see how many people are in that state. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4964.0s)]
*  Like that's one of the things that I find very troubling about a lot of these big cities, like particularly like Los Angeles, that are just overrun by these homeless encampments. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4974.0s)]
*  And it was interesting because I saw something today about Gavin Newsom and he is trying to there. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4987.0s)]
*  Apparently there's some sort of law that he's trying to get rid of that does not allow you to move homeless people. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=4998.0s)]
*  And he's trying to get rid of that. And he's making sense. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5006.0s)]
*  It's like this is not good for them. It's like it's you're not saying that you're not caring about these homeless people. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5012.0s)]
*  To just be forced by law to not be able to move these encampments seems insane, not just counterproductive, but a barrier to productivity, a barrier to progress. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5018.0s)]
*  And, you know, kudos to him for trying to do that. I give that guy a lot of shit. I probably shouldn't. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5031.0s)]
*  You know, because like I think that job is insane. He said something crazy about me recently. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5037.0s)]
*  So like his son is involved in these micro cults where he's listening to people like Jordan Peterson and me. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5042.0s)]
*  And I think he's upset because I called him a con man, which I probably shouldn't because that's not product productive either. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5049.0s)]
*  Just call someone a con man. He's a politician. He's doing what he's trying to do. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5055.0s)]
*  But he did do something I really like recently. He vetoed this bill that would have forced a parent to affirm a child's gender in order to keep custody of the child. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5059.0s)]
*  It was like some crazy sort of Orwellian thing that they're trying to do where you have to affirm a child's gender. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5074.0s)]
*  If the child is trying to change gender, if you do not do that, you could lose custody of your child. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5083.0s)]
*  And he vetoed that. So kudos to him for doing that. It's look it's got to be a fucking insane job, you know, and for us to stand on the outside and just shit on these people, especially someone like him who's handsome and tall and slick back hair. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5087.0s)]
*  And he talks really well. So he's bullshitting us. Look at all the problems he's created. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5104.0s)]
*  Look at all the things. But also try managing those problems. Try try figuring it out. What do you do with 100,000 homeless people, particularly if you can't even move them? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5108.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And so kudos to him for trying to figure out a way to get rid of that law. You know, it's so easy to criticize on the outside. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5117.0s)]
*  It's so easy to just look at this stuff on the outside and go, you know, you need to get it together. You fucking suck. But who doesn't suck? What mayor of a big city doesn't suck? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5126.0s)]
*  There's always going to be someone who thinks the person is totally awful and people who are like, oh, they're OK and people who love them, you know. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5136.0s)]
*  Well, especially like no one cared about him at all until covid. Nobody was upset at him. Right. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5144.0s)]
*  And then you're confronted with this problem that no one has faced in 100 years. We're going to shut society down. There's a pandemic. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5150.0s)]
*  There's a giant pandemic and there's these solutions on the table. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5159.0s)]
*  And politically, particularly in California, these are universally accepted solutions like everyone must get vaccinated. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5163.0s)]
*  I mean, you're literally having people like Sean Penn on TV saying that if you're not vaccinated, you're literally holding a loaded gun to people's heads. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5172.0s)]
*  Now, in their defense, at that time, they really believed that this vaccine was going to stop transmission and it was going to stop infection. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5179.0s)]
*  And if you didn't do that, you you were fucking it up for everybody else. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5190.0s)]
*  The problem with that logically, of course, is that if it didn't if it did stop transmission and it did stop infection, wouldn't people just realize that? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5195.0s)]
*  And you would you would like only the people who got the vaccine would be OK. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5205.0s)]
*  And then everybody else would be fucked. Of course, over time, we've realized that's not really the case. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5211.0s)]
*  It doesn't stop transmission. It doesn't stop infection. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5218.0s)]
*  And there's some very weird data that shows that the more often you are hit with these mRNA vaccines, there seems to be some correlating effects where like the Cleveland Clinic study, which showed that the more often people were vaccinated, those people got covid more than the people who weren't vaccinated as much or weren't vaccinated at all. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5221.0s)]
*  But how the fuck do you know that in 2020? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5245.0s)]
*  You don't. You know, when you're dealing with this thing in 2020 and universally, politically, especially in a blue state in a blue city like Los Angeles, you kind of have to do that because that's your job. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5247.0s)]
*  You have to tell people to go get vaccinated. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5261.0s)]
*  You have to tell people to do this. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5263.0s)]
*  And you should put, you know, if it really if you really did think it would work, you'd put incentives in place to make sure that it does work. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5264.0s)]
*  But then also when you know that it doesn't anymore, then you have to adjust. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5272.0s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5277.0s)]
*  And the problem with that is then you have to admit you're wrong. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5278.0s)]
*  And that's terrible politically. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5281.0s)]
*  Yeah, because then you give your enemies fuel and then they get to come after you. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5283.0s)]
*  You were wrong about this and you were wrong about that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5286.0s)]
*  But I was right and I should be the leader. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5289.0s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5291.0s)]
*  I think, you know, when that when that thing went down, we didn't know what was right or wrong. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5292.0s)]
*  Nobody knew what was right or wrong. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5298.0s)]
*  I think most people are trying to make the best guess they could given the information that we had. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5299.0s)]
*  But I think you're also right in the sense that once we learn that the information that we were working off of isn't right, we need to correct and be vocal. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5304.0s)]
*  And I think that generally being more open about why we're making the decisions we are and accounting for the uncertainty is probably the answer rather than trying to pretend we know everything in the moment when the reality is that we don't. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5313.0s)]
*  It's just super difficult to do that and be a politician because you're dealing with polls. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5329.0s)]
*  You're dealing with people that they pick on every single thing that you say and try to find fault in it and try to find their own counterpoint that's more effective and more accurate. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5334.0s)]
*  And then you also have money. Right. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5348.0s)]
*  You have the influence of the pharmaceutical drug companies that want everybody to get vaccinated. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5350.0s)]
*  They want everybody to do it. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5354.0s)]
*  And they want the politicians to do it. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5355.0s)]
*  And then when your people want it to what do you do? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5357.0s)]
*  Do you stand up and say, hey, folks, I don't think we should do that. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5361.0s)]
*  That's pretty easy to do if you're in Texas, like with Governor Abbott did. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5364.0s)]
*  He was like, you know, like, no, I'm not going to force people to do anything. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5368.0s)]
*  And no, we're going to open the state back up. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5371.0s)]
*  And I remember so many people were like, oh, my God, you're going to kill people. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5373.0s)]
*  You're opening up way too soon. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5378.0s)]
*  This is dangerous. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5380.0s)]
*  Turn out that wasn't the case. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5381.0s)]
*  But if it was right, then, you know, those people, it was a lot of guessing, man, tons of guessing, tons of guessing. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5384.0s)]
*  And Monday morning quarterbacking is so fucking easy to do. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5391.0s)]
*  And I do a lot of that. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5395.0s)]
*  I do a lot of morning quarterbacking. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5397.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5399.0s)]
*  The the question of homelessness, too, is a big one, especially addiction. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5401.0s)]
*  That's one that I covered in this book. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5407.0s)]
*  Addiction is the big one. Right. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5410.0s)]
*  Addiction is the big one. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5411.0s)]
*  It's the extreme end of an ability to not get enough. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5412.0s)]
*  Also incentives, you know, places like San Francisco in particular and Portland, where they actually give people, I think it's San Francisco. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5416.0s)]
*  They actually give people money to stay there. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5425.0s)]
*  So these people are there and they give them X amount of dollars a month for food and for whatever they need. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5428.0s)]
*  And they sort of incentivize these people to not improve their lives. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5435.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5439.0s)]
*  I think, you know, addiction is really interesting because for the longest time we thought about it as a moral failing. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5440.0s)]
*  So an addict is a bad person. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5446.0s)]
*  And now the shift, it sort of shifted around 1995 to thinking that an addict has a brain disease. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5448.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure that that's quite right either. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5457.0s)]
*  I think personally, after looking into this, that addiction is more of a symptom of an underlying problem and that using the substance solves the problem in the short term, but creates a long term, long term problems with everything over gambling, with gambling, with eating. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5462.0s)]
*  I mean, that is the story of what addiction is, right? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5479.0s)]
*  Using the short term reward that creates long term problems and consistently doing that over time. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5481.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5486.0s)]
*  I think the problem with the model we currently see it as is being a brain disease is that it can deflate hope for people. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5487.0s)]
*  So when you look at reasons why people relapse, there was a big study in New Mexico of alcoholics. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5497.0s)]
*  I found that the number one reason for relapse was believing that addiction was a brain disease. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5504.0s)]
*  And therefore, if I have this disease and there's no known cure for it, what's the point of even putting up an effort? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5510.0s)]
*  And those people tended to relapse at much higher rates. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5517.0s)]
*  So I think for me and and I'll I'll tell you, I've been sober nine years and for a long time I thought it was a brain disease. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5520.0s)]
*  And I went into this book thinking that and I've changed my mind. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5527.0s)]
*  And I have a ton of empathy, too, because I think that if you are addicted and I can tell you this, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5532.0s)]
*  nothing solves a problem like using your substance of choice in the short term. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5538.0s)]
*  Like it is ultimately a solution for a problem. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5544.0s)]
*  And that's how really drugs have always been. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5548.0s)]
*  So when you look at when humans first started using psychoactive substances, they're often used as a tool, as a solution. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5552.0s)]
*  So, for example, you chew coca leaves, you get more energy, you get more focus that helps you on a long hunt. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5560.0s)]
*  Right. Alcohol used to, you know, waft off of fermenting fruit. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5565.0s)]
*  You smell alcohol in the air, you go eat that fruit. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5569.0s)]
*  It's going to help you find the fruit. One, you're going to eat more of it because it has a low level of alcohol. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5572.0s)]
*  And it also kills a lot of germs on the fruit. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5577.0s)]
*  So this is a story of like every psychoactive substances. Right. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5580.0s)]
*  In the past, the actual psychoactive component itself was relatively scarce, but it helped us live on. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5583.0s)]
*  The difference is that now we've sort of concentrated the psychoactive effect and put it at scale. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5589.0s)]
*  And I think that is really what starts to create a lot of these long term problems because it is such a such a stronger substance. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5598.0s)]
*  And it's available everywhere. Everywhere. It's available at every restaurant. Every restaurant has drugs. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5607.0s)]
*  Yep. I'd like a glass of whiskey with my meal. Exactly. You're on drugs. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5614.0s)]
*  Exactly. Whether you realize it or not. So I went to to study this topic and understand it. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5618.0s)]
*  I ended up traveling to Iraq. Now, Iraq is an interesting case study of this because they used to not have addiction, really. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5624.0s)]
*  And a lot of that is because Saddam ruled with an iron fist. There's no drugs getting in the country. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5633.0s)]
*  The U.S. ends up invading and, you know, throwing him out. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5638.0s)]
*  And because of that war, you have a lot of people who are in trauma. They have problems. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5642.0s)]
*  The economy is in ruin. They've lived through a war. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5647.0s)]
*  And then what happens is that Syria falls and becomes a narco state and they start pumping out a drug called Captagon. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5650.0s)]
*  Have you heard of this? No. So it is analogous to methamphetamine. It's a pill. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5658.0s)]
*  They put a lot of stimulants in it. Now, Syria produces no shit billions and billions of pills that are moving around the Middle East right now. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5663.0s)]
*  Like they just busted a big shipment. I can't remember where it was coming through in the Middle East, but it was like a billion some odd dollars worth of Captagon. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5674.0s)]
*  So this drug is sweeping across the Middle East. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5681.0s)]
*  And so what happens in Iraq is that you have a population who is has a lot of pain, a lot of problems in their life. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5684.0s)]
*  There's not many outlets for those problems. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5693.0s)]
*  And then you have a substance come in that solves problems in the short term. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5695.0s)]
*  And you tend to see addiction spike in that country. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5699.0s)]
*  So I and it was a wacky trip to I had you know, I need to get a fixer or whatever. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5703.0s)]
*  And I land on this guy and he sends me this email. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5710.0s)]
*  He goes, OK, I know you're here to study Captagon here. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5714.0s)]
*  All the groups we're meeting with the precise times we're going to meet them. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5717.0s)]
*  Here's the hotel you're going to be staying in. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5721.0s)]
*  It's the nicest, most secure hotel in Baghdad. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5723.0s)]
*  I'm going to pick you up in this secure top of the line SUV. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5725.0s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. You're good to go. OK. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5728.0s)]
*  So I land there. My man picks me up in a 10 year old beat to hell Hyundai base model, drops me off at my hotel, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5730.0s)]
*  which is this sort of hole in the wall, just bombed out hotel, picks me up the next day. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5741.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, let's get our meetings going. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5747.0s)]
*  You know, he goes, oh, no, no, no, those are just proposals. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5751.0s)]
*  The itinerary was proposed. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5755.0s)]
*  This guy totally bullshitted me on like every fact of this. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5757.0s)]
*  Oh, no. And I'm in Baghdad. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5760.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, this is going to be a long week. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5762.0s)]
*  How long ago is this? This was last summer. Oh, boy. Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5764.0s)]
*  So I'm going, all right, well, let's figure this out. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5768.0s)]
*  He goes, no, don't worry about it. Just, you know, worry about other things like what we're going to have for lunch. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5773.0s)]
*  I'll figure this out for you. I'm like, OK, whatever, dude. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5777.0s)]
*  So the first few days, we're just madly driving around Baghdad in this dude's, you know, neither secure nor top of the line Hyundai the whole time. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5780.0s)]
*  And he's texting and calling people. He's got two phones. He's texting as he's driving. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5789.0s)]
*  And he ends up getting in like two car accidents, doesn't even stop the fucking car duty, just like banks off a car and just rolls down my window and yells some shit in Arabic. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5794.0s)]
*  What do you say to those people? He goes, I said, why are you in my way? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5804.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. Like, OK. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5808.0s)]
*  But just as this guy's sort of grift worked on me, it starts to work on other people. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5812.0s)]
*  So he somehow talks us into this police compound on the outskirts of town where they hold the big drug smugglers in the country and different terrorists. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5818.0s)]
*  So I talked to the police there. We talked to some of the people in the prison. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5829.0s)]
*  Then he ends up getting this sort of off the books meeting with two Iraqi intelligence officers who work on the border of Syria fighting Capitogon as it comes through. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5834.0s)]
*  And they told me just crazy ways that people get the drug over. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5845.0s)]
*  So a lot of times the government, because it's all controlled by the government, by the way, will hire farmers like shepherds and have them store the pills in the stomachs of sheep. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5849.0s)]
*  So they'll open the stomach of the sheep, put the drugs in in a bag, sew the sheep's stomach and then have them just move across the border in the night. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5862.0s)]
*  So if you're looking at them as a intelligence officer or the army, you're going, oh, it's just a shepherd. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5869.0s)]
*  Now it turns out that actually they're drug smugglers. And so the sheep are still alive. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5874.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're still alive. And they just put in some sort of a bag that doesn't get broken down by the stomach acid. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5879.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Wow. That's crazy. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5884.0s)]
*  So they do surgery on the sheep. Yeah. Stuff the pills in there. Yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5887.0s)]
*  And just walk up the wall. I mean, we're talking billions of these pills circulating in the Middle East. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5891.0s)]
*  And but if it's the government that's moving them in the Syrian government. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5896.0s)]
*  Yeah. So Syria is effectively a narco state now. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5900.0s)]
*  So most of their they make some crazy amount more money producing Capitogon than they do all their legal exports combined. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5903.0s)]
*  So what happens is that after the country fell, they took over the pharmaceutical plants and the pills are all pumped out there now. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5912.0s)]
*  And it's all controlled. Most of it is controlled by what's called the Fourth Division, which is sort of akin to our sort of Navy SEALs, like this really elite military unit controls it all. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5921.0s)]
*  And also like Hasbala, which is a been named a terror organization, is involved in the trade, too. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5932.0s)]
*  Eventually, we get this meeting with the guy who's the head of psychiatry for all of Iraq. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5937.0s)]
*  And basically what happens is I'm able to I'm in the country going, OK, like nothing is really this guy is just piecing together these kind of meetings as we go. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5945.0s)]
*  And I tracked down a guy who's a journalist in the country and I kind of tell my situation. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5953.0s)]
*  He goes, you know, call this guy. So my fixer calls the head of psychiatry. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5958.0s)]
*  And the guy tells him immediately, you know, just text me whatever. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5965.0s)]
*  So, OK, he starts texting with him and my fixers to start smiling and goes, he'll take a meeting. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5969.0s)]
*  But he thinks I'm another person with with the same name, but he'll take the meeting. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5977.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait, so he thinks we're someone else and we're going to this meeting. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5981.0s)]
*  And my fixer is like, yeah, I'm like, I don't know, man. He goes, listen, he'll talk. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5984.0s)]
*  He will talk. So we go to this damn meeting. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5989.0s)]
*  And, you know, we come in and the guy's kind of looking at us like, you're not who I expected. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5993.0s)]
*  But we sit down with him and I get him to that first. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=5998.0s)]
*  He's kind of trying to shoot us out, you know, but I get him to start talking to us. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6002.0s)]
*  And he echoed sort of the same that we've been talking about. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6006.0s)]
*  He goes, look, like the brain disease model and this complex neuroscience around drug addiction is interesting. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6009.0s)]
*  Obviously, the brain changes due to drugs. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6017.0s)]
*  But the question is whether those changes obliterate all ability to make choice and to change. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6020.0s)]
*  Because that's sort of what the government of the U.S. sort of claims. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6027.0s)]
*  When you look at NIDA's website, it's all on the brain disease model. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6032.0s)]
*  It says that drug addiction is this recurring disease. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6035.0s)]
*  Basically, if you have it, you're going to relapse, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6040.0s)]
*  And he really talked about how it is a confluence of a population who's in pain, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6045.0s)]
*  no way to get out of the pain and a substance that solves the problem in the short term. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6051.0s)]
*  So people who are addicted to drugs, they're making a very rational decision to use those drugs because it is solving a problem. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6056.0s)]
*  Right. If you are a addicted person and heroin solves your problem or having a drink solves your issues you face, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6064.0s)]
*  well, you're making a rational decision. But the problem is that the problems are piling up in the long term. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6073.0s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. So what was your addiction? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6078.0s)]
*  Alcohol. Yep. So I haven't drank for nine years. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6083.0s)]
*  And you just found yourself wanting a drink to solve problems, to escape. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6087.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was escape. I've had to think about that a lot, especially as I wrote the chapter. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6092.0s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of, you see a lot of different stuff for why do people have an addiction. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6096.0s)]
*  And I think the reality is that there's not just one reason. There's a lot of reasons out there. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6102.0s)]
*  Different people use four different reasons to access. For me, so for example, you know, one, I can't remember. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6108.0s)]
*  There's one thinker out there who basically says the opposite of addiction is connection, that people who are addicted don't have social connections. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6115.0s)]
*  And I can tell you for me, that wasn't true at all. I had plenty of friends. I felt connected. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6121.0s)]
*  I found that for me, I had at the time I was working in this job that was rather boring. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6125.0s)]
*  I had a lot of sort of bound up energy and I like new sort of extreme experiences and I could find that through alcohol. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6133.0s)]
*  So if I drank, I could be wild and free in a world that is increasingly orderly and sanitary. Right. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6143.0s)]
*  It's like I'm going to be I'm going to be on my game all the time. But the moment I start drinking, it's a game like, you know, the world opens up. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6149.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can be I can be who I want to be and sort of really let loose. Who the hell knows what's going to happen tonight. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6158.0s)]
*  That's the comedian lifestyle. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of comedians get addicted to alcohol. Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6165.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because obviously you're in a bar almost every night and a lot of guys like a drink or two before they go on stage. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6171.0s)]
*  Then afterwards, hey, let's meet down the bar. And then people are handing out shots. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6177.0s)]
*  And then, you know, you're at some fucking dingy hole in the wall at two o'clock in the morning and laughing and having a good time. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6181.0s)]
*  And then, you know, it's this constant cycle. You think you need that to enjoy yourself. Exactly. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6188.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so for me, I think getting sober, it was one, I had to realize that it wasn't going to be easy. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6193.0s)]
*  It's not going to be easy no matter who you are. But it is necessary. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6203.0s)]
*  I mean, I really do think that I would have died early had I not gotten sober. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6208.0s)]
*  I mean, it was pretty bad at times. And so I have a lot of empathy for people who are addicted because I understand that, you know, there's this great in Dante's Inferno, the book. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6212.0s)]
*  He describes Satan as living in a world of cold and ice. So hell, as he pictures it, is cold and nice. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6226.0s)]
*  And now Satan is in hell, which is cold. And he's stuck up to ice to his waist. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6235.0s)]
*  And in order to do anything in his life, he's always had to flap his wings. That's how we get. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6242.0s)]
*  That's how he gets places. But he doesn't realize that as he's stuck by flapping his wings, the ice is just getting colder and colder and colder and getting him more stuck. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6247.0s)]
*  And that's what addiction is like. So you've done this thing. It worked for you for a very long time. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6255.0s)]
*  Improve your life. And then it started causing your problems. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6261.0s)]
*  But it is still this behavior you've learned that has the potential to solve all your problems. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6265.0s)]
*  And you still think that it's going to do do the thing that's going to improve your life. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6271.0s)]
*  But the problem is, is you can't see that because it's like that's just what you've always done. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6276.0s)]
*  But what about the genetic component? Because there are people that seem to be more genetically predisposed to alcoholism. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6280.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that I think there definitely is a genetic component to a point. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6287.0s)]
*  It's kind of like it's kind of like with food, right? Right. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6292.0s)]
*  Genetics loads the gun and then your environment pulls the trigger. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6297.0s)]
*  So I think there are I mean, both of my parents, for example, are my mom has been in recovery for a long time. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6301.0s)]
*  My dad, I don't know. I've met him maybe one time and I've you know, why? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6306.0s)]
*  I can only assume it's because you think it's over. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6312.0s)]
*  And so I think that's part of it. But then also you go, OK, well, there's the genetic component, but also, you know, [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6315.0s)]
*  growing up in a single parent household and my mom had to travel for work a lot. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6322.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of there's a lot of things underlying the surface. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6328.0s)]
*  And you go, you know, why, why is it that and I don't think this is just for people who have a drinking or drug problem. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6331.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things it's like, why is the thing that makes you feel like that's it? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6342.0s)]
*  That like solves my problems. I feel better right now. Why is it the thing that it is? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6348.0s)]
*  For some people, it's food. Yeah. For some people, it's gambling. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6352.0s)]
*  For some people, it's literally getting super hooked on working really hard, just being a workaholic. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6356.0s)]
*  For others, it could even be a behavior that society doesn't reject, like exercise. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6362.0s)]
*  Right. It becomes an escape from problems and a way to deal with life. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6368.0s)]
*  Hold that thought. I got to pee. Yeah, no problem. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6375.0s)]
*  And we're back. Much better. Yeah. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6378.0s)]
*  This is the thing you can't concentrate when you have to pee. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6381.0s)]
*  You're sitting there going, I can't get the words out. Amen. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6384.0s)]
*  I don't even know what I just said the last 30 minutes. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6388.0s)]
*  We were talking about alcoholism and drug addiction and whether or not it's a mental disease and this crazy drug in Iraq. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6390.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think it's it's wild that I've never even heard of that before. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6398.0s)]
*  The amount of Captic can is that what you say? Captagon. Captagon. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6403.0s)]
*  The amount of pills circulating the Middle East. Is that what it looks like? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6407.0s)]
*  Do they have any of the images of it coming out of sheep guts? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6411.0s)]
*  I look for that. I mean, once you see that, you can smuggle it lots of different ways apparently. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6414.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's got this. OK, so you see the photo that we're on there? It's got those two crescent moons. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6418.0s)]
*  They all tend to have that on them. And it's just a mix of. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6422.0s)]
*  So it started in the 60s as a legal pharmaceutical drug. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6424.0s)]
*  And I think they banned it in the 70s or it might have been that. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6430.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think mid 70s because it worked too well. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6433.0s)]
*  People were getting hooked on it and it was. Yeah. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6436.0s)]
*  And then what had happened is that enough people, especially in the Middle East, were using it as a pharmaceutical that some drug gangs came in and started making it themselves. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6440.0s)]
*  And now it's just slowly transitioned where Syria runs it all. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6452.0s)]
*  The wild one in America that's legal is Adderall. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6457.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we have we have billions of pills circulating as well. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6461.0s)]
*  I know so many people that use Adderall. They use Adderall for productivity. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6464.0s)]
*  These Adderall as a journalist, it helps them write these Adderall to function. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6470.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot of people that take that stuff. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6476.0s)]
*  And we Googled it once. What's the number, Jamie? Was it like thirty nine million prescriptions a year? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6479.0s)]
*  I've heard one in eight people are on some sort of attention enhancing stimulant. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6484.0s)]
*  Well, we are. We're on coffee. Yeah, we can't be hypocrites. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6491.0s)]
*  We're on coffee and I've got a Zen in my mouth. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6495.0s)]
*  It's that goes back is like people. Yeah, I'm a liar. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6498.0s)]
*  People fucking fraud. I'm over here enhanced. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6501.0s)]
*  And plus I smoke pot. Well, that's not the way it is a little bit whopping forty one forty one point four million Adderall [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6506.0s)]
*  prescriptions were dispensed in the US in twenty twenty one up more than 10 percent from twenty twenty. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6513.0s)]
*  And what is twenty twenty three? Does it keep going? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6518.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I think one of the real big issue that we're facing is I don't know necessarily if addiction is climbing or not. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6522.0s)]
*  What I do know is that our drugs are stronger and cheaper than ever. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6530.0s)]
*  And many of them have stuff added to them that makes them much more dangerous. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6535.0s)]
*  So you see the overdose death rate go up significantly as fentanyl start starts to get added to different drugs. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6541.0s)]
*  Right. But that you know, I've had this conversation. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6549.0s)]
*  I had this conversation recently with Alex Berenson and we were discussing whether or not drugs should be legal. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6552.0s)]
*  Right. Because if drugs were legal, then you could get pure cocaine and pure heroin. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6559.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have to worry about it being laced with fentanyl. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6564.0s)]
*  Maybe less people would die. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6567.0s)]
*  But then we both agreed that that would at least for a while create a new problem where many more people would use it because it's legal. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6568.0s)]
*  And how many more of those people would get addicted that wouldn't have gotten addicted because they wouldn't have bought it illegally. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6578.0s)]
*  Right. That's super great question. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6583.0s)]
*  I don't know. So it's like it's really answer. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6587.0s)]
*  It's very similar to the alcohol prohibition dilemma that they faced in the 1920s. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6589.0s)]
*  Right. During the prohibition time, the only way to get alcohol was you got to get alcohol from bootleggers. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6594.0s)]
*  Right. And so that's that's odd. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6603.0s)]
*  You saw drinking rise, too. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6606.0s)]
*  I think part of it goes back to sort of that loop idea that I was telling you about in the sense that unpredictable rewards tend to hook people more than predictable rewards. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6608.0s)]
*  So when you think of illegal drugs, it you don't know if you're going to get them. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6621.0s)]
*  You don't know how strong they're going to be. You don't know who you're going to get them from. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6627.0s)]
*  You don't know if you're going to get in trouble. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6630.0s)]
*  And so there's all these up in the airs that make that search for drugs, I think, more compelling than if a drug is legal. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6632.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6641.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you look at the places where they have the least amount of drugs, they probably have really high crimes, like very high punishments. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6642.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like Singapore. Right. Right. I don't think that's good either. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6653.0s)]
*  No, because we can't control. I mean, Singapore is an island. Right. They'll kill you. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6657.0s)]
*  They catch you with marijuana, which is insane, which is wild. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6661.0s)]
*  Yeah. Terrifying. But it definitely would keep you from doing marijuana. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6664.0s)]
*  You don't want to fucking die. You don't want to get locked in a jail and get beheaded or whatever they do to you. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6668.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you so much harder to get to. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6672.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Because the penalty for smuggling it in is death, too. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6675.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it's all coming. You know, there's only so many entry points into the country and they all are either by boat or by plane. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6679.0s)]
*  So it's either coming through the ports or the airports. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6687.0s)]
*  Imagine trying to score in Singapore. Just the fucking fear involved in that. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6689.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. Well, for some people, that's the extra rush. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6696.0s)]
*  Oh, it is. Yeah. Yeah. The thing that's illegal, the naughty thing. Right. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6700.0s)]
*  I'm going to go get me some forbidden fruit. Exactly. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6705.0s)]
*  Get me some forbidden marijuana. Forbidden fruit tastes better than normal fruit. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6708.0s)]
*  That's for you. And you see that in behavior for sure. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6713.0s)]
*  I mean, so drinking rose during prohibition and partly because of the forbidden fruit effect. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6716.0s)]
*  And we still even celebrate that today with NASCAR. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6722.0s)]
*  I mean, that sport evolved naturally out of people souping up their cars to drive them to drive whiskey places. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6725.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. We've talked about that before. It's amazing. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6732.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy, right, that it's like one of our national pastimes. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6734.0s)]
*  And it came out of drug running. Totally. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6738.0s)]
*  So it's I mean, it's a fascinating and it's a complicated topic. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6742.0s)]
*  I wonder if that'll be the case in the future if drugs become legal, if they'll have like submarine races from like Colombia to America. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6748.0s)]
*  Because that's the wildest one. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6756.0s)]
*  When the DEA agents, DEA agents jump on top of these fucking submarines and they're banging on the roof, like, stop it. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6758.0s)]
*  Open up. We're here. Have you seen those videos? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6765.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the videos. Oh, my God. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6769.0s)]
*  Those guys are wild. Really? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6771.0s)]
*  Those DEA agents are fucking wild, whether it's Coast Guard or DEA, whoever those federal agents are that jump on top of fucking submarines. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6774.0s)]
*  See if you can find it, Jamie. Oh, God. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6782.0s)]
*  It's crazy because this fucking submarine is shooting across the water and these guys jump on top of this goddamn thing and they're banging on the door. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6784.0s)]
*  Holy hell. Where did they get the submarines, Russia? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6792.0s)]
*  Good question. Probably. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6794.0s)]
*  Like, where do you buy a submarine? Like, if you and I go, OK, we're going to get a submarine. Like, who the hell do we call? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6796.0s)]
*  Here it is. Look at this. This fucking dude is banging on top of the door. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6801.0s)]
*  Open up, bitch. On a submarine. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6808.0s)]
*  Jumping on top of a fucking submarine. Drug submarine bust. 12,000 pounds of cocaine seized. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6812.0s)]
*  Jeez. Think of how big of an industry that is. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6818.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a giant industry. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6822.0s)]
*  Now, here's the question. I mean, is the solution legalizing it? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6824.0s)]
*  You know, and this is the conversation again that I had with Berenson. We're both like, boy, I don't know. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6829.0s)]
*  I mean, I am all for freedom. I'm all for people being free to choose to do whatever they want to do. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6834.0s)]
*  And then we deal with the consequences. But is that, you know, what if your child dies of a fucking heroin overdose because heroin is legal? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6838.0s)]
*  Totally. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6846.0s)]
*  You know, what are you going to say to that person? Hey, man, freedom. You know, what are you going to say? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6847.0s)]
*  Like, no, you're not going to say. But then again, what if your child dies of an overdose because they thought they were just getting, you know, some valium or something like that. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6851.0s)]
*  And it actually turned out to be fentanyl. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6860.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the that's it's so tricky. And I, I do think that you start to see the deaths go up when you don't know what you're getting. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6862.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. And then there's also the reality that certain cartels will poison certain they would literally do that to put other cartels out of business. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6870.0s)]
*  Right. So they'll if one cartel has like a grip on one area, they'll they'll release poison, you know, like literally on purpose tainted cocaine so that this cartel goes out of business or they get attacked. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6880.0s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I do think that there is more hope for people than we often might think. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6896.0s)]
*  A interesting stat that I read is that one in 10 Americans have report having gotten over a substance abuse issue in their lifetime. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6908.0s)]
*  Fifty percent of them got over it on their own. So what tends to happen in a lot of the big government studies where like, you know, the numbers are very dire once you're hooked on a substance, it's very, very hard to quit. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6916.0s)]
*  They tend to look at some of the worst cases, not some of the more, you know, average cases. And in those more average cases, the odds of recovery are a lot higher. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6928.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of it has to do with a lot of times we age out as as simple and strange as that sounds. You tend to see addiction spike in people who are about 15 to 25. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6941.0s)]
*  And that's because of the way the brain is changing during that time. So risk is something that we naturally get drawn to. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6954.0s)]
*  We're looking for social connection and we're also looking for how we find comfort and meaning in the world. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6962.0s)]
*  And so if you introduce a substance that does those things for people at that age, we're more likely to sort of learn using that substance as something that enhances our lives. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6968.0s)]
*  But once you start to age out over time, people generally find other things that provide whatever the drug was providing for them and are able to get off it. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6978.0s)]
*  Well, also, hopefully with age comes wisdom and with a bunch of negative experiences, you know, there's the term reaching rock bottom. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6988.0s)]
*  That's with a lot of addicts. They have to hit the bottom where they go, I have to fucking do something. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=6998.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've all known people that, you know, you go, hey, man, you got to stop drinking and they don't want to do it. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7003.0s)]
*  And they don't know if you drag them to a rehab, they'll start drinking when they get out. Right. They just can't stop themselves. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7009.0s)]
*  Like for whatever reason, they haven't hit rock bottom or they haven't decided that their life is so fucked up with with this stuff that they'd be better off without it. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7016.0s)]
*  I think one of the great benefits to people like yourself is that someone who has gone through that can now talk about it. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7024.0s)]
*  And they go, oh, well, look at this. Michael Easter is a very smart guy. Like, how did he get? OK, he's he's just like me. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7033.0s)]
*  And he did it. I can do it, too. He's smart. He's not some fool. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7040.0s)]
*  He's he's a guy who recognizes why he got trapped in this terrible cycle of behavior and thinking. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7045.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he got out of it. I can get out of it, too. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7051.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you that once you get out of it. So if if addiction is if you think of addiction as persistence against negative consequences. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7054.0s)]
*  Well, applied to drugs and alcohol, that's a bad thing. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7063.0s)]
*  Applied to a lot of other things. That is the ultimate life hack. Right. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7066.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. To focus like I write books. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7070.0s)]
*  Writing a book is a lot of sitting in an office in the dark very early and having to wade through studies, having to figure out how do I put together this narrative? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7074.0s)]
*  It is oftentimes frustrating as hell. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7082.0s)]
*  There's a lot of negative short term consequences, but you could almost argue. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7084.0s)]
*  Thought about this a lot that my persistence against negative consequences with drinking has carried over into this other part of my life where it is actually creating long term benefits. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7089.0s)]
*  So that's a message that I like to tell people, too. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7099.0s)]
*  It's like if you can get over this, you can apply your your crazy brain, your crazy behaviors to something that will enhance your life. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7103.0s)]
*  And that makes you pretty damn unstoppable. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7110.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the opposite exists as well, particularly with athletes. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7112.0s)]
*  I see that in a lot of fighters and even in other athletes, they are addicted to success. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7118.0s)]
*  They're there. They are like single minded in their pursuit of excellence to the point where it overwhelms all the other aspects of their life. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7126.0s)]
*  All they care about is winning. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7135.0s)]
*  They want to win, win, win, win, win. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7137.0s)]
*  And then they can't do it anymore. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7139.0s)]
*  And then it's gone and they need something else. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7141.0s)]
*  And some of them get addicted to I knew a guy who was a top flight pool player, like a real world championship caliber pool player. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7144.0s)]
*  And I knew him really well. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7154.0s)]
*  And he was clean and sober, didn't smoke cigarettes, didn't do anything. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7158.0s)]
*  And then he was in a car accident. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7162.0s)]
*  And when he was in a car accident, he hurt his back. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7164.0s)]
*  And when he hurt his back, he couldn't play pool. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7166.0s)]
*  And they started giving him pills. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7168.0s)]
*  And the same thing that made him addicted to excellence in pool now transferred over to pills. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7170.0s)]
*  And so now he was addicted to pills and he just couldn't stop taking them. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7178.0s)]
*  He had this wiring in his brain that was now filled with pills like he had a hole and that pills like we'll take that spot. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7181.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7191.0s)]
*  And the pills took that spot and he wound up dying of an overdose. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7192.0s)]
*  And before he died, like my friend told me that one time they were all at a diner and he fell asleep in his food. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7195.0s)]
*  He literally like tipped forward and his face went into his food into his plate, just fell asleep. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7203.0s)]
*  And this guy was Mr. Clean and sober. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7208.0s)]
*  What pool halls are filled with degenerates and all these people that are drinking and gambling and doing drugs. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7211.0s)]
*  And they're these wild outcasts of society like and this guy was the opposite. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7218.0s)]
*  This guy was I'm not going to fall into that trap. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7224.0s)]
*  I'm going to be the best. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7226.0s)]
*  And he would eat clean and drink water. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7227.0s)]
*  And he was like super fucking he would dress clean and play really well. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7230.0s)]
*  And he was one of the best players in the world. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7236.0s)]
*  And ultimately the drugs got him. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7238.0s)]
*  I mean, he hurt his back really badly. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7243.0s)]
*  Had to get surgery in his back. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7245.0s)]
*  And they gave him these fucking oxys. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7246.0s)]
*  And he just went down that road and then died. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7249.0s)]
*  I mean, that's, you know, you know, it's terrible. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7252.0s)]
*  It happens to a lot of athletes, man, a lot of fighters. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7256.0s)]
*  It's that they lose this thing that sort of gave them meaning. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7260.0s)]
*  And then they got to find a different thing. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7265.0s)]
*  It gave them an identity and gave them thrills. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7268.0s)]
*  The thrill of a fight is the craziest thrill, the thrill that knowing that there's going to be this one event that you're preparing for. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7271.0s)]
*  So you're preparing for weeks and weeks and weeks for this one thing. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7279.0s)]
*  And either it's the greatest experience of your life when you win or it's the worst feeling in the world if you lose. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7283.0s)]
*  And if it's the worst feeling in the world, then you go back to the drawing board and you want to figure out how to get that great feeling again. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7289.0s)]
*  You want to figure out how to achieve excellence. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7295.0s)]
*  And if you can get there, if you can get back to excellence again, then you want to get it even further and further. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7297.0s)]
*  Then you want to be the best. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7302.0s)]
*  You want to be the champion. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7303.0s)]
*  You want to be the number one. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7304.0s)]
*  And then when you're number one, it's like, how long can I hold on to this? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7305.0s)]
*  I'm 34. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7307.0s)]
*  You know, my body's starting to give out. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7308.0s)]
*  My fucking knees are going. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7310.0s)]
*  You know, my back hurts now. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7311.0s)]
*  I got a pinched nerve in my neck. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7312.0s)]
*  I got to get a fucking epidural so I can compete. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7314.0s)]
*  And, you know, and then they wind up breaking their body down. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7317.0s)]
*  And then we had Kurt Angle on the podcast. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7320.0s)]
*  Kurt Angle, who was an Olympic gold medalist in the heavyweight division. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7323.0s)]
*  OK, the cutoff to the heavyweight division is one ninety eight. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7329.0s)]
*  He weighed one ninety nine. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7332.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm so good. I don't need to cut weight. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7335.0s)]
*  I'm so disciplined and so good. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7337.0s)]
*  And he beat guys that were like 260, 270 pounds. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7339.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7342.0s)]
*  He won the Olympics with a broken neck. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7343.0s)]
*  He broke his neck in the Olympic trials, broke his neck, rehabbed it somewhat and got a bunch of fucking Novakane shots in his neck so that he could compete. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7346.0s)]
*  Went on to win the fucking Olympics with a broken neck. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7357.0s)]
*  So think about the amount of mental strength that this guy has and then broke his neck five more times doing pro wrestling. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7360.0s)]
*  She's and and and performed with a broken neck. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7370.0s)]
*  And then the pills, right? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7374.0s)]
*  The pills got him. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7376.0s)]
*  And then he eventually got free of them. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7377.0s)]
*  And, you know, he talked about it and talked about the journey he was just on. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7380.0s)]
*  Because you're talking about a guy who is literally as mentally strong as the smallest number of people that have ever lived. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7384.0s)]
*  Right. You know, like the fucking point zero zero zero one of human beings, the discipline, the drive, the will, the focus, the strength, the grit. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7390.0s)]
*  You know, wrestlers above and beyond in amateur athletics are some of the toughest human beings ever because it's all for glory. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7401.0s)]
*  There's literally no money in it. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7410.0s)]
*  There's no money in wrestling. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7412.0s)]
*  There's no like if you win the gold medal, you can go on and play for the professional wrestling league. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7413.0s)]
*  Like if you win a gold medal in basketball, well, hey, you can go and play in the NBA. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7421.0s)]
*  If you win a gold medal in many sports, there's a professional outlet. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7427.0s)]
*  There's literally no professional outlet other than the entertainment outlet, which is what he went into, or professional mixed martial arts, which is a different skill set. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7431.0s)]
*  You have to learn other things. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7439.0s)]
*  So you're talking about an insanely powerful person and he got caught in it. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7441.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it can it hits anybody and everyone. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7445.0s)]
*  Anybody in every we have this idea that a person who's addicted is, you know, the person you see on the street like that woman that you mentioned. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7449.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7455.0s)]
*  It's it's it can hit anyone for all different sorts of reasons. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7457.0s)]
*  But I think the upside is that. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7461.0s)]
*  It isn't a guarantee that you're not going to get clean or anything like that. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7464.0s)]
*  Like there are there are paths out of it. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7469.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they look different for every single person. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7472.0s)]
*  All right. So I had a guy who helped me get sober and I was asking him, I like, you know, what do what do people need? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7475.0s)]
*  You know, he goes, well, sometimes people need a pat on the back and sometimes they need a little bit of a kick in the ass. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7483.0s)]
*  Right. It's like everyone needs something. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7489.0s)]
*  Right. And what's going to work for one person isn't necessarily going to work for another person isn't necessarily going to work for another person. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7491.0s)]
*  But I do think that the commonality you find is that it takes action. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7496.0s)]
*  It's not going to be easy. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7501.0s)]
*  And you have to find something that gives you that replaces the whole. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7503.0s)]
*  So in the case of your friend, it's like there was the you know, the wrestling was that was the life that went away. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7508.0s)]
*  It got filled with whatever the you know, the drug of choices. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7514.0s)]
*  OK, now we've got to drain that and we've got to put something else in there because if nothing changes, nothing changes. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7518.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7523.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they say. Like get addicted to something good, like learn how to play golf or something. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7524.0s)]
*  Get addicted to something that's productive. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7529.0s)]
*  Yeah, it could be exercise. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7531.0s)]
*  Yeah, it could be some of you know, there there's all sorts of ways people recover. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7533.0s)]
*  There really are. And I think that, you know, something like 12 step programs, they really help a lot of people. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7538.0s)]
*  They're not for everyone, though. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7544.0s)]
*  And so if you know, if you're a person who's suffering and that just didn't seem to work for you, I would suggest, you know, try something else. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7545.0s)]
*  How'd you do it? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7551.0s)]
*  I went through a program of people who were like minded and helped me deal with my underlying issues and sort of gave me counseling. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7553.0s)]
*  And I think that helped me start to peel the layers. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7562.0s)]
*  It's not something I'm super active in now, but a lot of it did come down to figuring out, OK, well, why am I doing this thing in the first place? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7565.0s)]
*  How have I replaced it? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7575.0s)]
*  Whatever I was chasing, can I get that in a different kind of chase? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7578.0s)]
*  You know, you know, so for because I like sort of extreme experiences, sort of exploring the edges, intense living. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7581.0s)]
*  I mean, OK, backcountry hunting. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7590.0s)]
*  Let's go. Let's go in the woods for like a week. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7593.0s)]
*  Right. That's like pretty extreme. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7595.0s)]
*  Yeah, extreme or even exercise, I think, gives me a lot of that. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7597.0s)]
*  A lot of the travels I do, you know, there's a reason that I could have gone and investigated drugs in, say, Ohio. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7601.0s)]
*  Why the hell did I go to Iraq? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7610.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7612.0s)]
*  Because I kind of need that. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7613.0s)]
*  You want an extreme experience. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7616.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7618.0s)]
*  And it's, you know. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7619.0s)]
*  The hunting one is very valuable for veterans. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7621.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7624.0s)]
*  A lot of veterans, they leave that world and they're very lost and they need something that helps them. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7625.0s)]
*  And for many of them, hunting fills that void because it's so difficult. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7632.0s)]
*  And I'm sure a lot of people listening to this that have an aversion to that idea of hunting and that they think it's cruel. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7637.0s)]
*  And I get how they wouldn't understand that. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7643.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, a lot of those people also eat meat. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7646.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you eat meat or if you even eat vegetables, unfortunately, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7649.0s)]
*  that's the real sucky reality is that unless you grow all of your own food organically and you know exactly what you're doing and you eat vegetables that you grow yourself, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7654.0s)]
*  if you're getting food from monocrop agriculture, you're 100% contributing to the loss of life and not just one life. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7665.0s)]
*  But do you think that a frog is as important as an elk? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7672.0s)]
*  Do you think that a ground nesting bird is as important as an elk? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7677.0s)]
*  Because if I shoot an elk, I eat that elk for months. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7681.0s)]
*  Yeah. If if you buy a bushel of corn, there are a lot of deaths attached to that in insects because of pesticides and fawns and these things that get ground up and combines when they're rolling over the fields. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7685.0s)]
*  Like there's a crazy video that I saw of these these grain combines that are rolling across this field and they hit this patch and you see all these deer just scatter out of there, barely, barely making it out alive. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7700.0s)]
*  Geez. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7715.0s)]
*  As this thing is running them over. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7716.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7718.0s)]
*  Yeah, rabbits, all sorts of things get killed in that. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7719.0s)]
*  And, you know, you could say that that's also the cycle of life and that that most certainly doesn't go to waste because something will eat those birds or the birds will eat those those dead rabbits, you know, the vultures and and coyotes and all these animals that do get killed in the cultivation of grain. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7723.0s)]
*  They will feed wildlife. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7742.0s)]
*  Nothing goes to waste in the wild. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7744.0s)]
*  You know, that's the thing. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7746.0s)]
*  Like, even if you like, say, if you're hunting and you shoot an animal and it runs into the forest and you can't find it and you go, oh my God, I've killed something for no real. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7747.0s)]
*  Well, believe me, something's going to find that thing. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7757.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7759.0s)]
*  It's it's going to get eaten. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7760.0s)]
*  It's like there's nothing that goes to waste in the wild. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7761.0s)]
*  Zero things go to waste. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7764.0s)]
*  They will find it. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7765.0s)]
*  They will smell it. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7766.0s)]
*  They will get to it. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7767.0s)]
*  They will eat it. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7768.0s)]
*  They'll consume it down to the bones. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7769.0s)]
*  You see it over and over and over. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7772.0s)]
*  I was mentioning that that scarcity loop system that tends to draw people in and sort of people tend to get hooked on. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7773.0s)]
*  Well, I mentioned how it evolved from hunting and gathering. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7781.0s)]
*  So you can also find activities that fall into that that enhance your life in the process. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7785.0s)]
*  Hunting. Great example. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7790.0s)]
*  Because as you're falling into that random, you have an opportunity to find an animal. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7792.0s)]
*  You don't know where it's going to be. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7798.0s)]
*  You don't know how big. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7799.0s)]
*  You don't know anything about what that experience is going to like, how it's all going to unfold. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7800.0s)]
*  And then when it does unfold, it's like, oh, my God, that was amazing. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7804.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7807.0s)]
*  And then you can do that again the next year. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7808.0s)]
*  It's also people think it's easy. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7810.0s)]
*  And you've experienced it. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7812.0s)]
*  It's not easy. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7813.0s)]
*  It's not easy at all. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7814.0s)]
*  No, it's so hard, especially with the bow and arrow or the bow and arrow. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7815.0s)]
*  It's insanely hard. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7819.0s)]
*  It requires incredible amounts of discipline and practice. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7820.0s)]
*  But even with a rifle. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7823.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're especially if you're on public land, it is so difficult to get an animal. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7825.0s)]
*  It's so difficult. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7831.0s)]
*  And depending upon what you're doing, unless you're like pig hunting in Texas, you could you get a pig in Texas. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7832.0s)]
*  And they want you to do that, obviously, because they're invasive species. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7839.0s)]
*  But it's people have this idea that you're going out there with this high powered scope and a rifle and just easily taking out some animal. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7842.0s)]
*  And then you'll see it online when someone will post a picture of an animal like, what if that animal's armed? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7852.0s)]
*  This isn't fair. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7857.0s)]
*  You should use a spear or you should go run up to it and stab it. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7858.0s)]
*  You think you're a real killer. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7861.0s)]
*  Go do it with your teeth. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7863.0s)]
*  You know, like it's you see a lot of like ridiculous perspectives. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7864.0s)]
*  And I kind of I know where they're coming from. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7868.0s)]
*  I see where they're coming from. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7870.0s)]
*  They think of it as a cruelty thing, but it's because they haven't experienced it. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7871.0s)]
*  I think if they went and they saw how hard it is, just like you're trekking through the mountains, eight, ten, ten miles a day, it's exhausting. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7874.0s)]
*  You're burning thousands of calories. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7883.0s)]
*  You're going up and down an elevation. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7885.0s)]
*  You have to be in great shape. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7886.0s)]
*  And you could easily go 10, 11 days and come home empty handed and eat tag soup. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7888.0s)]
*  It happens more than it doesn't. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7894.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7896.0s)]
*  And people people get greater rewards from things that are harder to get. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7897.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7901.0s)]
*  That's what we ultimately find. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7902.0s)]
*  If I if I say give someone a check for a million dollars, it's great. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7904.0s)]
*  But they would value that so much more if they had to build a business or something that earned it. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7910.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7916.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7917.0s)]
*  And I think that goes back to a lot of I mean, I think a lot of why we are the way we are and what we value goes back to evolution. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7918.0s)]
*  And so that psychologist I was telling you about earlier, Thomas and tall, he said the reason that we get more value from things that are harder to get is probably because if you had to work harder to get something in the past that saved your life, you want to incentivize that repeat searching. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7927.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7945.0s)]
*  So the harder you work for something, if you get this giant like, oh, my God, that was amazing. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7946.0s)]
*  Right. We did it. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7950.0s)]
*  That's going to incentivize future persistence. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7951.0s)]
*  Like winning a fight. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7954.0s)]
*  Like winning a fight. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7955.0s)]
*  Yeah. All the work that goes into that. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7956.0s)]
*  Right. You know. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7958.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7959.0s)]
*  And so I think finding realizing that improvement and finding things that you truly value and mean something to you are ultimately going to be a challenge. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7960.0s)]
*  And this even this applies to marriage. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7969.0s)]
*  This applies to, I'm sure, raising kids. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7971.0s)]
*  I can't imagine that's easy. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7973.0s)]
*  It applies to all these different things that are important part of being a human today, knowing that, you know, a lot of times the process is the reward and the heart of the process, probably the bigger reward. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7975.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7984.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that cliche. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7985.0s)]
*  It's all about the journey. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7986.0s)]
*  And it is. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7987.0s)]
*  It's like you these little moments where you have success. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7988.0s)]
*  These moments there. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7992.0s)]
*  They're just a testament to the fact that the grind is worth it. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7994.0s)]
*  What do you how do you what are you feeling internally when you hunt? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=7998.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8003.0s)]
*  Don't fuck it up. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8006.0s)]
*  But you can't think that because you'll fuck it up. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8007.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8009.0s)]
*  But you want to make sure that you've done everything you need to do before a hunt. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8011.0s)]
*  I lose weight. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8017.0s)]
*  I get in really good shape. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8018.0s)]
*  Like when it comes July, I start really ramping up my cardio. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8019.0s)]
*  I start rocking. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8024.0s)]
*  I carry kettlebells. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8025.0s)]
*  I do like farmers carries. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8027.0s)]
*  I do all these different things. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8029.0s)]
*  I pull sleds just so I can more easily manage my way through the mountains. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8030.0s)]
*  And I put a lot of emphasis on that this year. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8036.0s)]
*  A lot more than I did last year. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8039.0s)]
*  And I got in much better shape. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8041.0s)]
*  I really kept my diet clean and I practiced every day. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8042.0s)]
*  I was outside in the Texas heat. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8046.0s)]
*  It was one hundred and four degrees out. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8048.0s)]
*  I had a giant sixty four ounce or sixty two ounce whatever it is. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8050.0s)]
*  Sixty four ounce hydro flask filled with like liquid IV and water. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8054.0s)]
*  So I'm just out there hydrating in one hundred and four degree heat. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8059.0s)]
*  Just practicing my shot over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over for hours. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8063.0s)]
*  To the point my shoulders hurt. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8071.0s)]
*  My arms not steady. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8072.0s)]
*  You know to the point where I should have probably quit four or five groups earlier because my groups are getting a little scattered because my arms not steady anymore. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8074.0s)]
*  But when I get to the mountains I know that I've dotted all my eyes. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8081.0s)]
*  I've crossed all my T's. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8086.0s)]
*  I'm in great shape. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8087.0s)]
*  I have great accuracy. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8088.0s)]
*  I'm very good. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8090.0s)]
*  I know what to do and I can do it. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8091.0s)]
*  So it's knowing that that you've done the preparation. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8093.0s)]
*  That's very important. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8097.0s)]
*  It's a terrible feeling to not feel confident to be doing this and not feel confident. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8098.0s)]
*  I saw a few guys that were like that in camp that maybe it was their first time bow hunting elk and they weren't really prepared. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8103.0s)]
*  And you can tell that they weren't prepared and you can tell that they could tell that they weren't prepared and they weren't successful. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8110.0s)]
*  There was I don't know how many hunters in camp with us. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8115.0s)]
*  I think there was 30. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8118.0s)]
*  Two guys got elk with a bow. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8120.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8123.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8124.0s)]
*  Deseret. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8125.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8126.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8127.0s)]
*  Tough year. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8128.0s)]
*  Tough year. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8129.0s)]
*  Because of the snow? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8130.0s)]
*  Snow. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8131.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8132.0s)]
*  They lost a lot of deer. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8133.0s)]
*  I think they lost elk too but they lost a lot of deer. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8134.0s)]
*  Like in some places some parts of the ranch they said they lost some like 50 percent of their deer. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8137.0s)]
*  One place they lost 80 percent. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8142.0s)]
*  They think they lost 80 percent to the winter die off. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8143.0s)]
*  Yeah man it's a fucking hard world out there for those animals. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8146.0s)]
*  They're freezing to death. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8149.0s)]
*  I pulled a tag last year for the cash area which is right by which is basically within where we were at Deseret. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8150.0s)]
*  And that went well and I had gone with a buddy whose name is Chase Lambor and he's at Utah State. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8158.0s)]
*  He's a PhD wildlife researcher. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8165.0s)]
*  Kid I went to high school with. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8167.0s)]
*  So old buddy and then he turns out he you know goes and gets a super smarty pants PhD and a cool subject. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8168.0s)]
*  So I went with him and you know I asked him like should I put in this year? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8174.0s)]
*  And he's like I don't know man like Utah is kind of a mess with mule deer this year. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8179.0s)]
*  Like you're not going to pull anything. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8182.0s)]
*  They got killed. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8183.0s)]
*  Yeah they all got killed off. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8184.0s)]
*  Yeah it could be a while many years until they bounce back to the numbers they were a few years ago. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8185.0s)]
*  But that's the reality that these animals live in you know. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8191.0s)]
*  So it was tough in that respect. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8194.0s)]
*  The numbers were a little lower than normal. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8197.0s)]
*  You know it's also tough when they have a lot of feed you know because there was so much rain and so much rainfall. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8200.0s)]
*  There was feed everywhere and water everywhere. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8207.0s)]
*  So it was more difficult predicting where they're going to be and finding them. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8209.0s)]
*  And then you know it's just fucking hard. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8213.0s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8216.0s)]
*  A lot of trekking. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8217.0s)]
*  It's a lot of trekking. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8218.0s)]
*  You got to be in shape and you got to be ready. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8219.0s)]
*  You know it's it's hard. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8221.0s)]
*  But when it's over when you're successful. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8224.0s)]
*  Who has a great feeling of relief a great feeling of satisfaction and the food that you get from it is the finest animal protein that you can get. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8228.0s)]
*  Yeah the best stuff in the world for you. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8238.0s)]
*  Totally. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8240.0s)]
*  What do you feel like your your most rewarding hunt has been. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8241.0s)]
*  It's always the hard ones you know it's always the difficult ones. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8247.0s)]
*  It's like the desert is a hard one because not because of density. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8251.0s)]
*  There's a lot of animals there. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8254.0s)]
*  But it's just hard terrain. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8256.0s)]
*  It's you know and the wind swirling like you have to have so many there's so many factors. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8258.0s)]
*  I mean there's so many times you're getting close and then you feel the wind to the back of your neck and you're like fuck. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8264.0s)]
*  And then you see the elk just like pick their head up and just start running. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8273.0s)]
*  Hundreds of yards away. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8274.0s)]
*  They smell predator like fuck this. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8276.0s)]
*  And you know that's why they're you know eight nine years old. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8279.0s)]
*  The guy the elk I shot was 11 years old. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8282.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8284.0s)]
*  He was a wild. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8285.0s)]
*  It was a perfect elk to shoot because his teeth were worn out. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8286.0s)]
*  They were really worn down and he might have not made it through the winter. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8290.0s)]
*  You know he was they don't really live older than 11. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8294.0s)]
*  You know right. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8297.0s)]
*  In the wild like and there's mountain lions all over the place up there. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8298.0s)]
*  Is there a lot more now. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8302.0s)]
*  They have a lot. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8303.0s)]
*  They have a lot to the point where Utah changed their laws and they made mountain lion hunting. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8304.0s)]
*  All you have to do is get a tag. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8309.0s)]
*  It's not a draw anymore. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8311.0s)]
*  Yeah like and you could shoot him like coyotes. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8312.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8314.0s)]
*  My mom. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8315.0s)]
*  So I grew up in just north of Salt Lake City and the home I grew up in. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8316.0s)]
*  My mom has a mountain lion that hangs out in her backyard quite a bit because there are some woods behind her house. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8321.0s)]
*  It's a pretty developed area too but there just happens to be this wooded area where there's a park and she'll hear the mountain lion at night having just killed some deer because there's some deer that live in there and third they get pretty damn big around there. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8342.0s)]
*  I've seen three mountain lions in my life and the two that I saw before the one I saw two years ago the two that I saw previously were very small. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8343.0s)]
*  I saw one in Colorado was probably the size of a dog and then I saw one in Montecito. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8352.0s)]
*  We were driving down the road and I thought what I saw was a coyote run across the road until I saw the tail. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8359.0s)]
*  I was like oh my god it's a mountain lion. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8365.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8367.0s)]
*  This is a brief glimpse. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8368.0s)]
*  And again this is probably a 60 pound animal. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8369.0s)]
*  Two years ago we saw one that was easily 180 pounds easily. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8372.0s)]
*  He was fucking huge. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8379.0s)]
*  I think that I think that was the hunt that I was on too. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8381.0s)]
*  Was it was it. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8385.0s)]
*  Yeah because I remember you coming back and being like oh my god dude we just saw like in your eyes are just saucer ride. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8386.0s)]
*  I was so scared and I was in a truck. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8392.0s)]
*  That was a crazy thing. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8394.0s)]
*  We were we were driving down this road and it was at dusk and as we were driving down this road my friend Colton saw these eyes under this tree and he hits the brace goes look at the size of that fucking cat. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8395.0s)]
*  And we looked this thing had a pumpkin head like this big old muscular head you know like a like a rock wall has where they have this big muscles on the side of their head. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8408.0s)]
*  Bumps all over it. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8418.0s)]
*  And these massive forearms man his forearms were fucking huge and it was just like crouched underneath this tree staring at us 30 yards away. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8420.0s)]
*  And I'm in the truck so I pulled up binoculars. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8429.0s)]
*  So I'm looking at him through 10 power binoculars and I'm seeing his whole face. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8432.0s)]
*  I'm looking in his eyes. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8436.0s)]
*  I'm seeing his body and like what do you do if you zig when you should have zagged and you run into that thing like holy shit was it big. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8438.0s)]
*  Yeah you just say well there are worse ways to die. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8448.0s)]
*  I guess I'll take this one. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8452.0s)]
*  Yeah unless you have a pistol on you. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8453.0s)]
*  But it was it was it was eye opening because even the pit started change of topics but even the pistol thing is I mean that inserts its own form of danger. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8455.0s)]
*  Like I heard there was a guy last year in Wyoming who got mauled by a grizzly and he pulled out you know the Glock 10 millimeter just opened up the clip and he ended up shooting himself in the ankle. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8465.0s)]
*  Ay ay ay. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8477.0s)]
*  Friend of a friend. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8478.0s)]
*  Panic. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8479.0s)]
*  Yeah ends up at the bear ended up dying you know walked off dies. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8480.0s)]
*  But he shoots himself in the ankle it just blows his ankle. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8484.0s)]
*  And then they had to do 10 miles on horses to get the guy to a place where they could life flight him to get reception and they life flight him so this is in Wyoming they life flight him to University of Utah Hospital and they end up saving the foot. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8488.0s)]
*  Oh but in the process it's paid for that one. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8504.0s)]
*  Yeah well that's a panic moment right and you don't even know what panic is until you see a fucking grizzly bear. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8508.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8513.0s)]
*  You know Steve Ronella. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8514.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8515.0s)]
*  He had had encounters with bears in the past but he told a story and he was also with my friend Remy Warren who told a story in the podcast about they were in a Fog Nack Island. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8516.0s)]
*  So a Fog Nack is like Alaska and so there's the coastal brown bears. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8529.0s)]
*  So you're dealing with like an 11 12 foot bear. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8535.0s)]
*  Giant. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8538.0s)]
*  Giant. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8539.0s)]
*  Because they just eat salmon all day. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8540.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8541.0s)]
*  They eat elk because they're on this island hunting. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8542.0s)]
*  So he shot an elk and they're in this insanely dense area where it's very very difficult to pack out. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8544.0s)]
*  So they hang the elk in a tree. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8555.0s)]
*  They leave some of the meat they take some of it back. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8558.0s)]
*  They go back the next morning to get to the elk. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8561.0s)]
*  And they see some bear shit and they don't you know they don't think anything of it. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8566.0s)]
*  They're there. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8571.0s)]
*  The elk is still there. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8572.0s)]
*  They think they've got it. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8573.0s)]
*  Well some bear had claimed this elk and they didn't know that the bear claimed the elk and they're all sitting around eating lunch. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8575.0s)]
*  They're going to have lunch and then the kids it took them like hours to get to this place and then they're going to pack out the elk. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8582.0s)]
*  And while they're sitting there eating lunch this fucking 11 foot bear runs at them through the trees through the camp. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8589.0s)]
*  But there was so many people there that the bear doesn't know who to attack and just kind of runs through them. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8599.0s)]
*  And one of his camera guys this guy is nicknamed Dirtmouth. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8607.0s)]
*  Dirtmouth winds up on the bears back. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8612.0s)]
*  The bear like literally plows through these people and he's on this thing's back for like 10 yards as it's running and then he falls off. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8616.0s)]
*  My other friend Janice hits it with a trekking stick in the face as it passes him. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8626.0s)]
*  And he said it was literally a foot from his face. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8631.0s)]
*  This fucking gnashing enormous mouth this maw that would be instant death. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8636.0s)]
*  And he said all your ideas of what you would do in that circumstances they're all out the window. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8643.0s)]
*  Your reptilian brain completely takes over. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8650.0s)]
*  And this is a guy and Steve Brunello that is as experienced a woodsman as you will ever find. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8654.0s)]
*  He's also a brilliant guy. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8659.0s)]
*  He's very smart and he can articulate the experience in a way that not not that many people can. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8661.0s)]
*  And the way he described it was absolutely horrific. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8666.0s)]
*  Just horrific. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8669.0s)]
*  Like you just don't you don't have any idea what what that would be like until you encounter it. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8671.0s)]
*  And then when you encounter it you don't ever want to see that again. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8676.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Those things are so giant. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8679.0s)]
*  So giant. You don't even understand what it means until you're around them and they're running because they can run like a fucking quarterback. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8682.0s)]
*  Or a linebacker like a cornerback I should say. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8691.0s)]
*  They run fucking fast is what I'm trying to say. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8694.0s)]
*  Did they hear it before they did they just hear this coming through though. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8696.0s)]
*  I think they heard some noise in the woods and they turned and it was just running straight towards them literally like a bus. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8699.0s)]
*  Just a bus like a Volkswagen bus with teeth just running at you. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8707.0s)]
*  Fuck man. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8714.0s)]
*  So that's something that's literally 10 times the size of that cat that I saw. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8716.0s)]
*  I'm shit in my pants looking at this cat through a window 30 yards away in a truck where I'm kind of protected. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8721.0s)]
*  And they you know encountered this thing that ran through their camp. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8728.0s)]
*  Yeah well they're going to remember that for they'll remember that forever. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8732.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah it's you know there's just the reality of nature and the wild people that don't experience it like someone was telling me this today. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8736.0s)]
*  I need to know if this is true that in British Columbia you can't even shoot a bear in self-defense. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8747.0s)]
*  Really. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8755.0s)]
*  Yeah well they outlawed grizzly bear hunting. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8756.0s)]
*  And which is crazy because the problem with a place like British Columbia is that the voting population all exists in urban areas. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8759.0s)]
*  Right. So you have all your people from Vancouver. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8769.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful city and you know it's the kind of people that live there are urban people. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8772.0s)]
*  Right. They're not they don't have any experience with wildlife for the most part unless they regularly go out there so they don't even know what they're voting on. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8777.0s)]
*  And then in this bill comes across like should we outlaw grizzly bear hunting like well no one's hunting a grizzly bear to feed their family. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8784.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8793.0s)]
*  Like we should outlaw that. So they outlawed. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8794.0s)]
*  Well my friend Mike who runs a guide service in northern B.C. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8797.0s)]
*  He experiences he had to shoot a fucking grizzly bear from like three feet away from a cabin door. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8802.0s)]
*  So this thing was trying to break into a cabin and shoot it like as it was coming to the cabin door. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8808.0s)]
*  Like these are terrifying animals break into houses easy. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8814.0s)]
*  Yeah. Terrifying. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8817.0s)]
*  And there's also wolves up there like packs of wolves that will take out a horse every now and then. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8818.0s)]
*  So you like you hear some crazy noise. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8823.0s)]
*  You look out the window and there's a pack of wolves mauling one of your horses. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8825.0s)]
*  The wild that those people exist in it is so alien to anyone that lives in an urban environment that they pass these laws and they don't even know what they're voting on. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8830.0s)]
*  They don't understand. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8840.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8841.0s)]
*  They're forced to go out there and camp in the wilderness and encounter grizzlies and understand the population. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8842.0s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8848.0s)]
*  It's not a small number. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8850.0s)]
*  They're not endangered by any stretch of the imagination. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8851.0s)]
*  Grizzly bears are thriving up there. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8853.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8855.0s)]
*  And when you're not hunting them now they're not afraid of people anymore. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8856.0s)]
*  So at least when they were hunted they'd smell people and they go oh I equate the smell of people to someone hunting me. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8859.0s)]
*  I'm going to get out of here. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8865.0s)]
*  Now they don't avoid people at all. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8866.0s)]
*  In fact they say they come to gunfire because they hear gunfire and they think it's a downed deer and they go to steal that deer from the hunter. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8877.0s)]
*  So they hear a gun and they run towards where the gun is going to the gunfire. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8878.0s)]
*  Well and once you. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8882.0s)]
*  I mean so the whole point of the vote is that people perceive that they're limiting suffering. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8884.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8888.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8889.0s)]
*  But once you get populations big enough then you start to have problems with how much food they can access. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8890.0s)]
*  There's going to be infighting between them. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8895.0s)]
*  So you're going to get suffering on on the back end. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8896.0s)]
*  And then they go into ranchers and they start attacking cattle and they start. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8899.0s)]
*  It becomes a giant. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8904.0s)]
*  As soon as they're not threatened by people at all they become very fucking dangerous. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8906.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8910.0s)]
*  See if that's true. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8911.0s)]
*  You can't you can't shoot them even in self defense. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8912.0s)]
*  I can't find anything that says that. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8916.0s)]
*  I found a case where a guy claims self defense. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8919.0s)]
*  I found a case where a guy claims self defense but the judge said that didn't sound like self defense because he went back inside to grab his arrows. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8922.0s)]
*  Oh that's the only thing I could find out was even close to it. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8928.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8932.0s)]
*  I'm harder but I can't find it. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8933.0s)]
*  That could still be self defense because you go back inside the grab. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8934.0s)]
*  If you have to get out and it's there and now you have arrows on you. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8937.0s)]
*  It's kind of like what's happened on Maui with the access here. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8941.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8944.0s)]
*  There's just so damn many. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8945.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8946.0s)]
*  Except they're not dangerous. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8948.0s)]
*  And you can eat them. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8949.0s)]
*  I mean Newy Venison which is a company that's really done an amazing thing where they they hunt them. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8950.0s)]
*  They have a USDA processing facility on the ranch and you can buy wild game from Maui. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8956.0s)]
*  So you're helping control this invasive population. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8963.0s)]
*  You're getting this incredible delicious protein that's that's actually necessary to shoot them because they don't have any predators. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8966.0s)]
*  Yeah they don't have predators and the way that they're shooting them too is about as ethical as you can get. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8973.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8977.0s)]
*  And as I understand it in the middle of the night like right in the head like they're done. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8978.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8983.0s)]
*  It's it's very yeah they're using. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8986.0s)]
*  And they process it like I said with the USDA facility. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8987.0s)]
*  So you know that you're getting you know it's it's all clean and safe and it's all done correctly and sanitary and you know you can get the best protein that you can get. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=8990.0s)]
*  And it helps them because like Lenai is crazy. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9002.0s)]
*  When we were in Lenai, Lenai has three thousand people this gorgeous island and it has thirty thousand deer and you can't imagine the numbers when you're drunk. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9005.0s)]
*  We drove at nighttime and we hit the high beams and you just see eyeballs. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9016.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9025.0s)]
*  As far as the eye can see. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9026.0s)]
*  I mean you're looking at thousands and thousands and thousands of deer just in one field. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9027.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9033.0s)]
*  And just eating everything that they can and they hunt those at night too. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9034.0s)]
*  They hunt those with snipers. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9038.0s)]
*  They do everything they can. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9039.0s)]
*  It's great for the population because everybody there eats well. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9041.0s)]
*  They all they all have great food. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9044.0s)]
*  They all have great venison. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9045.0s)]
*  But it's just so unnatural. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9046.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9049.0s)]
*  And I guess they were a gift. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9050.0s)]
*  They were a gift to King Kamehameha. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9054.0s)]
*  And then they just overpopulated the island. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9057.0s)]
*  How do you feel like when you train this year? [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9058.0s)]
*  How did you feel? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9060.0s)]
*  Rocking helped you. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9061.0s)]
*  Well anything where you're carrying weight and you're going like one of the things that I did quite a bit is 30 percent incline on a I have a real good treadmill. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9062.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9075.0s)]
*  30 percent incline and put a weight vest on. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9076.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9078.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9079.0s)]
*  And just watch a movie and fucking grind. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9080.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9082.0s)]
*  That's the pack meal workout dude. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9083.0s)]
*  I do that a lot. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9084.0s)]
*  My feet my feet my calves were killing me. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9085.0s)]
*  It's hard man. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9088.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9090.0s)]
*  Another thing I did a lot of is the echo bike. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9091.0s)]
*  You know it's like an assault bike. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9093.0s)]
*  The rogue bike. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9095.0s)]
*  That one helped me a lot. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9096.0s)]
*  Intervals. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9097.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9098.0s)]
*  Tabata's. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9099.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9100.0s)]
*  So I do these 20 second sprints 10 second rest 20 second sprints and you do it a cycle of eight and I would do that at the end of my workout. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9101.0s)]
*  So do all I start off every workout with a cold plunge. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9107.0s)]
*  I do a cold plunge for three minutes. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9111.0s)]
*  Then I do my series of body weight exercises to warm myself up every day. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9112.0s)]
*  I do 100 push ups and 100 body weight squats on a slant board. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9117.0s)]
*  So I do those and then by that time I'm warmed up and then generally I do most days I do Nordic curls. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9121.0s)]
*  So I have a Nordic bench. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9133.0s)]
*  So I hook my heels into this thing and then I lift myself up with my hamstrings. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9135.0s)]
*  That's a hard exercise. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9140.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9142.0s)]
*  So I do reps with that and I'll do three sets of six or seven. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9143.0s)]
*  Now I'm up to seven. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9148.0s)]
*  Seven reps. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9150.0s)]
*  I want to make sure that I don't blow something out. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9151.0s)]
*  You know because it is hard to do. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9154.0s)]
*  It's like you're going yeah. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9156.0s)]
*  It's not a it's not like a body weight squat like I can do 20 body weight squats easy. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9158.0s)]
*  So I do sets of five five five sets of 20 rather. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9163.0s)]
*  You know so that's how I get my hundred in. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9167.0s)]
*  But the Nordics I take a good amount of time in between. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9172.0s)]
*  Like I'll do it and then I'll do like a good five minute rest before I attempt a second set. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9173.0s)]
*  Maybe even 10 minutes sometimes. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9180.0s)]
*  So I do those and then I generally do kettlebell routines or I do I have a series of body weight series that I do where I do 10 chin ups 20 20 dips and 10 L chin ups or end pull L pull ups. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9181.0s)]
*  So it's close grip where my feet are extended out in front of me. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9199.0s)]
*  And I'm doing these and I do sets of 10 of those and I'll do a circuit of five. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9200.0s)]
*  So five of those. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9205.0s)]
*  So I do you know so it's 50 chin ups 100 dips and 50 pull ups. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9206.0s)]
*  So it all winds up to be 100 and 100. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9213.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9216.0s)]
*  So I do that and then generally either I'll do neck exercises or core exercises like I'll do the iron neck and I'll do you know those hip glute ham machines where you can do a sit up where you're like way low. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9217.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9236.0s)]
*  So I do sets of 20 of those and I do back extensions the opposite of flip it around and then I have a sore next one that actually doubles as a reverse hyper. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9237.0s)]
*  So then I do my reverse hypers and then I stretch out and then you know stretch my back out because it's a lot of back you know it's a lot of compression there it feels like everything's tight. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9247.0s)]
*  So I you know relax and stretch that out and then generally I'll do my sprints on the air dye machine and depending upon how hard the workout is I usually do four or five rounds of Tabata's. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9258.0s)]
*  So you know you're doing eight eight sprints each round eight sprints with eight rests then I'll recover I get my I wear a heart rate monitor I get my heart rate down to about 100 and then I get back on it again and I do another one and I get it back down to 100. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9271.0s)]
*  Do it again and depending upon the workout like if I'm just doing that I'll do 10 I'll do 10 reps so 10 10 series of eight. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9298.0s)]
*  But if I'm doing all that other stuff first I'm so beat up by the time I get to that that I'll do four or maybe I'll push myself to do five and then I immediately go into the sauna. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9299.0s)]
*  So my cardio still bang it because it's like I'm going into the sauna my I'm already 130 beats from right off the right off the salt bike. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9309.0s)]
*  Yeah and it's 185 degrees in the sauna and I sit in there for 20 minutes. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9317.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9321.0s)]
*  Right on. That'll do it. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9322.0s)]
*  Yeah, it fucks you up. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9323.0s)]
*  But, but it gets you in tremendous shape. It really does. And if, if I'm, and I was consistent with that it made a big difference in the mountains I really know because I know obviously this is sea level it's like altitude here it's like fucking. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9325.0s)]
*  191 feet. It's nothing. And in Utah we were at 8000. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9338.0s)]
*  8000. Yeah. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9342.0s)]
*  So you have to be in shape. There's no other way to either you live up there and you fucking hike those hills all the time, or you prepare yourself. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9343.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9350.0s)]
*  So that's what I did. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9351.0s)]
*  I feel like the the slow grind of rocking is awesome for car cardio and then you just pair that with to what you're talking about which is that high intensity. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9352.0s)]
*  You hit both those systems and that's kind of a secret sauce to me. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9362.0s)]
*  A lot of what I think about too with hunting is, how can I resist injury. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9366.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9371.0s)]
*  An ankle or something out there or whatever it might be. I mean that can blow the whole thing for you so I also do a ton of durability work like just getting my ankles like real tight and resistant to falls, getting my knees nice and locked down and then the question just becomes [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9372.0s)]
*  Okay, can I cover ground while bearing load for an entire day and if the answer is yes like all right I feel pretty solid. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9387.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9395.0s)]
*  And can I handle a pack out if I have a heavy pack out. So I have one of those treadmills too that goes at a pretty good incline and I'll throw you know maybe a hundred pounds in a rock or something and just slow grind for a while and it's just the worst but you get it done and you're like all right. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9396.0s)]
*  One of the most satisfying things about the hunt was that I had to pack out. I had to carry these quarters on my shoulder and make it up this wet slope. So it's like very steep and it's pouring rain out and everything's wet. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9409.0s)]
*  You're stepping over wet logs and I'm carrying this quarter which probably weighs 80 pounds on my shoulder and I'm climbing over stuff and but you know I like I slipped but caught myself so I have the balance to catch myself. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9425.0s)]
*  It was all just confirmation that I had done the work. Yeah, it was very nice. Yeah, it felt great that I didn't have to feel like like I was underprepared. Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, good times. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9440.0s)]
*  But again it makes you want to get right back to it. As soon as it's over you're like okay don't slack off. Don't get fucking fat now stupid. Don't get out of shape because now I have a good base so I have to keep it going. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9452.0s)]
*  Well that's a great I mean it's a good pursuit because once a year you are gonna have to get in shape too which I mean you probably keep yourself in shape generally but a lot of people that's the thing that pushes them. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9464.0s)]
*  You need an activity right? A lot of people aren't just gonna get in shape just to get in shape. There needs to be some greater reason greater why behind it. Yeah. And finding that I think can be transformative for people. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9474.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have a goal instead of just saying I'm gonna be in great shape like why? Right. Like what you're never gonna use it but if you have a thing that you know you're gonna do in September that's fucking really hard to do. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9484.0s)]
*  And I really worked hard this year. Like I came into like July in great shape already so I was able to do it. I really never slacked off the whole year so it made it just it makes a difference. Also diet. Yeah. I cut out all the bullshit. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9493.0s)]
*  I cut out all the bullshit. I lost 10 pounds. I basically am on the carnivore diet. That's basically what I'm eating. And pretty strict and made a giant difference. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9507.0s)]
*  I think that cutting out of the bullshit is the most important thing for people. So part of the book I found this tribe that has the healthiest hearts ever recorded by science. They're called the Chamonix tribe and they're in the Bolivian Amazon. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9518.0s)]
*  So I go down and visit them in Bolivia. So I got to fly into La Paz which is like 13,000 feet. And I was supposed to take a small plane down which is a half an hour but the airline goes belly up like the day before I'm supposed to get there right. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9532.0s)]
*  So we got to take this 12 hour car ride down to the jungle and you take a six hour canoe ride up into the jungle and it's all just a wall of green right. You're going it all looks the same and it has for the last six hours. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9547.0s)]
*  And then eventually the guy, the canoe guy just goes up a bank and you're like how the hell do you know this is the place? So I get out and there's the tribe. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9559.0s)]
*  And the real difference maker, their diet generally at some point across the day it's going to break like every popular diet that we've been given in the last 40 years. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9570.0s)]
*  Like they eat some sugar, they eat some chocolate, they eat red meat, they eat fish, they eat white rice, they eat white potatoes. It's not low fat, it's not low carb, it's not right. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9585.0s)]
*  It's at some point it's going to offend someone. They eat corn. But the real difference maker is to your point about bullshit, it's all one ingredient right. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9596.0s)]
*  It's all just having one ingredient and they're not eating super processed food. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9606.0s)]
*  It's just real food. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9610.0s)]
*  It's just real food, real food. And meanwhile in the US I think something like 60% of the food the average American eats is ultra processed. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9611.0s)]
*  And so back to the scarcity loop idea I told you about, there's this quote from a guy who's with the food industry. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9619.0s)]
*  He said if you want to make a food so people overeat it, over consume it, it's got to have three V's. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9628.0s)]
*  It's got to have value, it's got to have variety, and it's got to have velocity. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9635.0s)]
*  Now that is just a different way of explaining what I just laid out right. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9640.0s)]
*  It's like the value has got to be relatively cheap, it's got to give you something. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9644.0s)]
*  Variety, you've got to have a lot of different flavors. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9648.0s)]
*  Not only within the food itself, so this mix of sugar, salt, fat, whatever it might be, but also a lot of different varieties of junk food. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9651.0s)]
*  It's like you go to the supermarket and there's like 45 different Doritos. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9659.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9662.0s)]
*  And then velocity. You have to eat it fast. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9664.0s)]
*  And so when scientists will put people in a lab and have them eat one diet that is basically unprocessed, [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9668.0s)]
*  very minimally processed versus an ultra processed diet where everything else is matched, this is an NIH study, [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9677.0s)]
*  the people who eat the ultra processed diet end up eating 500 more calories a day just by the fact that they eat it much faster. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9683.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9691.0s)]
*  And you don't get those natural breaks that you would with natural food that are telling you, oh, okay, you're full. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9692.0s)]
*  Because it's taking up more room in your stomach. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9699.0s)]
*  I mean, think of a boiled potato versus potato chips. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9701.0s)]
*  One ounce of a boiled potato might be 50 calories, vitamins, minerals, whatever. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9704.0s)]
*  One ounce of potato chips might be 250 calories. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9709.0s)]
*  And by the way, like how many boiled potatoes are you going to fucking eat? [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9712.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9715.0s)]
*  I'll tell you how many potato chips I could eat. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9716.0s)]
*  And the answer is quite alarming, right? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9719.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9721.0s)]
*  You can eat a ton of them. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9722.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9723.0s)]
*  I can keep going. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9724.0s)]
*  I'll have another second bag of Pringles or the box of Pringles or like Ruffles. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9725.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9730.0s)]
*  Oh, I love those. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9731.0s)]
*  So good. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9732.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9733.0s)]
*  So I think- [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9734.0s)]
*  Salt and vinegar ones. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9735.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9736.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9737.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9738.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that get you. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9740.0s)]
*  It's our food. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9741.0s)]
*  There's so many people that eat far more calories than they burn and it's easy to do. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9742.0s)]
*  If you're eating pizza, how easy is it to overeat on pizza? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9744.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9748.0s)]
*  So fucking- And that's not even processed. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9749.0s)]
*  It's good pizza. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9750.0s)]
*  Dude, yeah, I mean- [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9751.0s)]
*  Just the amount of calories. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9752.0s)]
*  Like a pizza from a place like a Domino's or a Pizza Hut, I mean it just literally like [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9754.0s)]
*  hits your mouth and just kind of melts. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9758.0s)]
*  And somehow you've just eaten one slice in like, you know- [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9760.0s)]
*  Seconds. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9763.0s)]
*  One bite. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9764.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9765.0s)]
*  It's probably who knows how many hundreds of calories in a slice. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9766.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to be- [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9767.0s)]
*  I'll have five, six slices. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9768.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9769.0s)]
*  So I'm literally burning off. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9770.0s)]
*  I mean, it would take me hours in the gym to burn off a pizza. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9771.0s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9776.0s)]
*  Like if I ate a whole large Domino's pizza, which I have, more than once. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9777.0s)]
*  Oh, I have two. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9782.0s)]
*  How many hours is that in the gym? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9783.0s)]
*  So many. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9784.0s)]
*  Probably like three hours of hard cardio. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9785.0s)]
*  And you're not going to do that. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9788.0s)]
*  And I don't think people realize just how many calories things have. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9790.0s)]
*  Like, okay, this morning, you know, before the show I go get a coffee or whatever and [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9795.0s)]
*  I get a black coffee, but you know, people's orders are coming out and you know, it's like, [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9800.0s)]
*  all right, I got a pumpkin Chino, cinnamon bond, frozen frappe, extra whip for so-and-so, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9805.0s)]
*  large. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9814.0s)]
*  And you're looking at that going like, that's probably 900 calories. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9815.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9820.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know? [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9821.0s)]
*  And that's like- [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9822.0s)]
*  The start of their day. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9823.0s)]
*  In addition, and that's not breakfast, right? [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9824.0s)]
*  That's like the coffee. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9825.0s)]
*  No, that's a nice coffee. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9826.0s)]
*  I'm just going to get a Starbucks. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9827.0s)]
*  Yeah, just going to get a Starbucks. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9828.0s)]
*  That's what they say. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9829.0s)]
*  I'll get a Starbucks. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9830.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a fucking milkshake. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9831.0s)]
*  Someone made a breakdown, I think on Instagram or something like that, of one of those Baskin [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9833.0s)]
*  Robbins coffee things, those flurries or whatever the fuck it is. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9840.0s)]
*  That's a McDonald's thing, right? [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9844.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9846.0s)]
*  It was 129 grams of sugar. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9847.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9850.0s)]
*  So they showed the actual amount of sugar you would get. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9851.0s)]
*  He had a clear, like, container that showed the amount of sugar that you'd be eating just [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9854.0s)]
*  drinking one of these things. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9860.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9861.0s)]
*  How do you stay awake after that? [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9862.0s)]
*  It seems like you'd go into a fucking sugar coma. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9864.0s)]
*  So when I was in the jungle with that tribe, we did have sugar. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9866.0s)]
*  We had a sugar cane, but the difference is that we had to walk into the jungle. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9870.0s)]
*  We had to physically chop it. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9875.0s)]
*  We had to move it to this expeller thing they have that is human powered. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9876.0s)]
*  So you put the cane in between these two wood pole things, and then you have to push this [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9881.0s)]
*  thing around, and it shoves the cane through that, and it juices it. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9886.0s)]
*  And so by the time you've done all that work, like, you've burned quite a few calories. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9890.0s)]
*  And by the way, you're not getting 129 grams from a thing of sugar, right? [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9894.0s)]
*  And so I think it just goes back for the average person that we don't move enough so we can't [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9899.0s)]
*  buffer the sugar, right? [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9906.0s)]
*  Diabetes could just be that you are, it's too much couch rather than too much of anything [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9907.0s)]
*  else. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9913.0s)]
*  And it's also just so easy to eat food today and take in a lot of calories in one bite, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9914.0s)]
*  because just as you know, I mentioned in the beginning, we got this casino lab figuring [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9921.0s)]
*  out what leads people to gamble more. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9925.0s)]
*  We've got tons of labs across the country going, how do we make super delicious, hyper [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9927.0s)]
*  palatable food that people will eat more of? [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9932.0s)]
*  Now, I don't fault these people. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9934.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the guy. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9935.0s)]
*  So it's Dunkin' Donuts. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9936.0s)]
*  That's what it is, not Baskin-Robbins. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9938.0s)]
*  Oh, 185. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9940.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9943.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9947.0s)]
*  Damn. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9948.0s)]
*  And how many people throw those things down every day? [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9961.0s)]
*  That's the ultimate calorie delivery. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9964.0s)]
*  Dunkin' Donuts. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9966.0s)]
*  I didn't know it was a Dunkin' Donuts thing. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9967.0s)]
*  Dang. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9969.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9970.0s)]
*  Yeah, we eat too much sugar. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9971.0s)]
*  We eat too much processed bullshit. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9973.0s)]
*  And if you don't do that, the interesting thing about the carnivore diet is you can't [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9975.0s)]
*  overeat. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9980.0s)]
*  I mean, you could, I guess. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9981.0s)]
*  I can't. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9982.0s)]
*  I get satisfied pretty quickly. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9983.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9985.0s)]
*  One 16-ounce steak or an 18-ounce steak, and I'm done. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9986.0s)]
*  But if that 16-ounce steak was sitting next to a bowl of pasta, I would eat the pasta [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9989.0s)]
*  too. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9995.0s)]
*  Smash the pasta. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9996.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9997.0s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, so good. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9998.0s)]
*  Like, even though I'm full, I'll still eat it because it's like you're getting this reward [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=9999.0s)]
*  from those carbs and the flavors. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10005.0s)]
*  And because that's one of the things they say about those competitive eaters, you know, [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10007.0s)]
*  when they're in those hot dog eating contests and shit like that. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10011.0s)]
*  They eat fries with it so that they could eat more food. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10014.0s)]
*  So they can keep going. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10019.0s)]
*  Which is wild. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10020.0s)]
*  If you offer a human more different food, they will eat more different food. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10021.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10025.0s)]
*  Like, they do studies in buffets and people always eat way more food than normal at a [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10026.0s)]
*  buffet simply because they're trying so many different things. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10030.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10033.0s)]
*  And there's incentives to do that. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10034.0s)]
*  So I think when you start to cut out food groups, you inevitably eat less food because [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10035.0s)]
*  it also becomes less rewarding as well. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10041.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10044.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10045.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10046.0s)]
*  I think that's what happens with this tribe as well. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10047.0s)]
*  I mean, when we sit down for lunch, we have chicken, white rice, some baked plantains, [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10050.0s)]
*  and some onions. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10057.0s)]
*  It was all terrible. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10059.0s)]
*  It was all fucking terrible, dude. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10061.0s)]
*  Just bland subsistence food. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10063.0s)]
*  Just bland as hell. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10065.0s)]
*  The chicken, I mean, so the chicken was probably, I don't know, like a three pound chicken or [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10067.0s)]
*  something. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10072.0s)]
*  I mean, now today in the U.S., our chickens are giant. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10073.0s)]
*  Giant. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10075.0s)]
*  And so this meat is just really like stringy and chewy. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10076.0s)]
*  And I'm going, thank you. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10078.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10079.0s)]
*  It's a wild chicken probably. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10081.0s)]
*  It's a wild chicken. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10082.0s)]
*  And so we just don't, we've enhanced the flavor of our food to such a degree that we're [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10083.0s)]
*  inevitably going to eat more of it, which don't get me wrong, this is a good problem [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10089.0s)]
*  to have in the grand scheme of time and space. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10093.0s)]
*  It's better than starvation. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10095.0s)]
*  It's better than starvation. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10096.0s)]
*  So people will be like, you know, the modern food system is the worst thing ever. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10097.0s)]
*  And it's like, well, compared to what? [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10101.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10103.0s)]
*  Compared to 200 years ago? [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10104.0s)]
*  No. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10105.0s)]
*  I mean, people are starving to death in America. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10106.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10108.0s)]
*  If they are and at all. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10109.0s)]
*  I don't know what the numbers are. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10110.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, usually that's abuse. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10111.0s)]
*  Someone starving. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10114.0s)]
*  It's usually a distribution problem. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10115.0s)]
*  And it often unfortunately happens with children because they've got shitty parents. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10116.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10119.0s)]
*  It's not a food thing. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10120.0s)]
*  We throw out about a third of our food. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10121.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10123.0s)]
*  Well, listen, Michael, it's always great to talk to you, my friend. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10124.0s)]
*  It's always great to sit down and talk to you about anything and everything. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnNZQ-0IqoM&t=10127.0s)]
