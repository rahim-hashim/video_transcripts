# Joe Rogan Experience #1532 - Mike Tyson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcPUoxTvw5g)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  So a friend of mine, he's a giant boxing fan, he sends me this text message, he goes, dude,
*  check this shit out.
*  And it's you training with Rafael Cordero.
*  And I remember looking at it and going, oh shit, what happened?
*  What happened?
*  The next time you were in here, you were talking about how you didn't want to work out.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it would ignite the ego.
*  Hey, let's talk about that too.
*  So I was discussing with my wife something about me being overweight.
*  You know, we have to get some time when I complain to your wife, you want to take care
*  of her in some kind of perspective.
*  And she said, well, why don't you just get on the treadmill for 15 minutes a day?
*  I said, ah, she said, just 15 minutes.
*  So it went from 15 minutes a day to two hours a day.
*  That's what you were worried about.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But I was complaining about my weight.
*  And so I don't know, I guess I tried on some clothes and it was disastrous.
*  And so I was worried about my weight.
*  And she told me the 15 minute route and it went two hours a day.
*  And I just started losing weight.
*  And then somebody, my brother-in-law said, hey, Mike, I know you're not going to win,
*  Would you fight this guy for like 40 million, 30 million bucks?
*  I said, man, get the fuck, I said, whoa.
*  I said, whoa.
*  Then somebody said, ding.
*  I was just giving him a, get the fuck.
*  I said, whoa.
*  And I said, well, who would they like me to fight?
*  And he said, one minute.
*  And they go, then it's Bob Sapp.
*  I said, okay.
*  And so I'm saying to myself, well, I know Bob.
*  And I said, and ho.
*  Because I know Bob is big and strong.
*  I said, ho, one minute.
*  How would they like me to fight him?
*  Can I fight him in the markets of Queensborough?
*  And he said, one minute, Mike.
*  He asked the guy.
*  The guy said, yes.
*  I said, I'll fight him.
*  Right?
*  And so-
*  So it was Bob Sapp was the first one that was brought up.
*  Yeah.
*  And so-
*  So for people who don't know Bob Sapp, Bob Sapp was a giant fighter in pride.
*  At one time he was like 375 pounds.
*  He was fighting all the kickboxers.
*  Solid muscle.
*  With abs.
*  It's incredible, right?
*  And it went from him to somebody else and another guy and MMA, then this guy.
*  And then somehow, you know, some other fighters.
*  And then it went from who else?
*  It was another heavyweight champ.
*  It was just a bunch of guys up there.
*  They fight.
*  And next thing you know, it came down to Roy.
*  And I'm like, I don't know what the hell is going on.
*  And then he signed the contract.
*  I signed the contract.
*  Next thing you know, I'm in the gym again.
*  And it's disastrous.
*  I'm trying to get in the shape.
*  I'm saying, did I really do this shit?
*  You know, you would probably know because if you're getting in shape and getting conditioned
*  they're two different animals.
*  They don't even belong in the same workout division of working out.
*  Like getting in shape is just being kind of fit.
*  Yes, and just getting in shape is able to fit your clothes.
*  Right, right.
*  You know, that's getting in shape.
*  Being able to fit your clothes.
*  Being in condition is being able to come outside of your soul.
*  You know?
*  And you can't do that automatically.
*  You're talking about being in fighting condition.
*  Yes.
*  That's a rare state and you can't keep it for very long.
*  No, it is just-
*  People need to understand that, right?
*  The emotional state to prepare for that is, ooh, mind boggling.
*  Well, that's what I was seeing when I was seeing you hit the pads.
*  I'm like, this isn't just working out.
*  There was something going on, man.
*  When you were working out with Cardero and you were ripping to the body and throwing those hooks,
*  I was like, this isn't a man who's preparing to go to combat.
*  This is not normal getting ready to work out shit.
*  That's why when I saw that video, I was like, oh.
*  Want me to tell you something about that video?
*  Yeah.
*  I did that video and I was in bed for a week.
*  That was 30 seconds and I was in bed for a week.
*  And it's not funny because it made me realize that this is big boy shit, okay?
*  Big boy shit.
*  This big boy shit.
*  There it is right there.
*  Yeah.
*  That wasn't really cool.
*  That's in the gym.
*  That's now.
*  The thing is though-
*  That's now.
*  That's going for five and six rounds.
*  That's now.
*  But I'm talking about before that 30 seconds, the first time I ever did it, I caught what's
*  the shit you kill when you can't walk?
*  Oh, sciatica.
*  Sciatica.
*  Everything came and all that shit that came back that made me quit boxing, all the pain
*  started coming back.
*  So, when you started training again, did you start doing it slowly after that?
*  Extremely slowly.
*  And then I started dabbing in the alternative stuff.
*  Like what kind of stuff?
*  Pshhh.
*  Cryotherapy type shit.
*  Cryo, stem cell research and therapy and some other interesting stuff that I just don't
*  know and it's just beautiful stuff.
*  Like what kind of stuff?
*  I don't know.
*  Hyperbaric chambers and just-
*  Everything.
*  Everything.
*  Everything to help you recover.
*  It's really interesting.
*  It is.
*  Well, I saw you when you walked in today.
*  God damn, you look good.
*  You look good, dude.
*  Like, your muscles look good.
*  You look like you're vascular.
*  You look fit.
*  And that's- and I'm starting to feel fit.
*  That's what's interesting.
*  I'm starting to know what I'm doing.
*  Like, I think I'm in shape and then the next thing you know, you think you're in shape
*  and then you start having like- Ralphie starts throwing punches at me.
*  It's like you're fighting.
*  I can't punch back.
*  I gotta avoid.
*  And then two rounds go by and you say, whoa, I'm not in shape.
*  I'm hitting the bag six rounds.
*  I'm doing this three or five rounds, six rounds.
*  I'm jumping rope.
*  And then I do two rounds with somebody.
*  It's a whole different psychological preparation and whoo.
*  How much time has gone since you first started exercising?
*  Like, when did it start?
*  So here we are with like August 23rd or something like that?
*  22nd.
*  22nd?
*  All right.
*  When did it start?
*  It had to start something like April.
*  April.
*  March, something like that.
*  So in the middle of the lockdown.
*  Yeah.
*  So you just started just training and now here you are five months later, four months
*  later.
*  How far away do you think you are to being in like fighting shape?
*  Oh, fighting shape.
*  One of the times come like by November 28th.
*  Yeah.
*  That's when you'd be ready.
*  Exactly.
*  Now why did you guys decide to move?
*  You were supposed to be in September, right?
*  I believe it was a viewing situation.
*  The proper timing for more people.
*  For audiences.
*  Yeah.
*  I believe it was something of that nature.
*  It's so exciting.
*  It's going to be awesome because it's going to be me and everyone else that's involved
*  in Aeros and everyone.
*  Innovation.
*  And we're going to start off the Legends Only League and that's going to be really
*  breathtaking, especially starting off with me and Roy.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm looking forward to that because I have athletes from every genre.
*  It's an array of everybody who believes that someone, they're all going to come back in
*  all fields.
*  And this is going to be something that me and Aeros Intervention created together.
*  And I think this is going to be pretty awesome.
*  So Legends Only League would be like all sports, baseball, basketball, everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Tennis.
*  Imagine if something crazy like we did with Billie Jean King that had somebody, yes, say,
*  one of the, Serena, somebody playing mack and roll and that kind of stuff.
*  Exhibitions and stuff like that.
*  Or somebody like Man of War can play one on one with whoever, Iverson or somebody.
*  I mean, Man of Peace.
*  Man of War is the horse.
*  Man of World Peace.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's an amazing idea.
*  But particularly for you, like seeing you hit the bag again and seeing you hit the pads
*  and get excited about it was very, very interesting to me because I knew that you had that thing
*  in your head where you didn't want to ignite your ego and then you had this quote that
*  the gods of war reignited your ego.
*  I read that I got so excited.
*  Well, that's the excuse I can use.
*  That's a really great excuse that I can use.
*  But it was a great quote.
*  It made me excited.
*  It made me excited.
*  And when I'm seeing you training, I mean, you know, there's some people that, you know,
*  everybody has opinions when something like this happens, when a man is 53 now, you're
*  54?
*  Yes.
*  54.
*  And decides to fight again.
*  As fit as you look, like, why not?
*  Why not?
*  Why not?
*  You could do whatever you want.
*  Why can't?
*  I mean, if you can go bungee jumping and ride a bull.
*  Exactly.
*  Listen, impossible is nothing to somebody that tries.
*  Everything that someone said was impossible has happened.
*  Yeah.
*  It certainly, well, listen, in 2020, with all the ways of recovering, all the things
*  we know, the science.
*  Exactly.
*  Our limitations create impossible.
*  Well, it's different now.
*  Limitations are different now.
*  Exactly.
*  So when you, like that video when you were ripping the pads and working out with Rafael
*  Cordero, how many, like, how long into that was that?
*  Like, how quickly did you get your speed back?
*  Was it right away?
*  No, speed, but that was our first day.
*  That was your first day.
*  That was our first day.
*  Let's try this.
*  That was our first day.
*  Wow.
*  And after that day, I was in the bed.
*  I had to come get the guy to do the fucking shots and electrocute me to get me back.
*  I had to say I couldn't walk.
*  I was crying to my wife and I was like, wow.
*  And I don't know why after that I should have said, this is over.
*  I'm not going to do it.
*  But that ego stuff, hey, come on, please.
*  Did it, does it, do you feel like you felt in the old days?
*  Like when, I mean, in terms of your mind, like the enthusiasm about this?
*  The enthusiasm, yes.
*  Sometimes I feel, I say this is bullshit.
*  I can't be feeling this good.
*  You know, and then, and I don't know, I think I really am.
*  I'm feeling good.
*  I said this bag, because I know the bag is a bigger bag, 200 pounds.
*  I said, well, this bag wouldn't be moving like this if I'm not hitting it kind of decently.
*  You know?
*  No, you look good.
*  Look, this is not like, I've seen guys come back and you see them working out and it looks sad.
*  And it doesn't look good.
*  What's exciting about you coming back is how good you look training.
*  Why not?
*  In this day and age?
*  But being a real fighter, this is what you know.
*  You see so many people that's in the gym.
*  Matter of fact, I've boxed people in the gym that kick my ass every day.
*  But then know what's different?
*  When you get them in the ring and there's a light on them and people are eating popcorn and drinking beer and they freak out.
*  So true, yeah, the pressure.
*  But you're Mike Tyson.
*  Exactly.
*  You understand that.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  If anybody knows how to deal with that pressure, it's you.
*  Absolutely.
*  But you know, it's good, but if you don't have the doubt, you're going to have a lot of trouble.
*  Right.
*  You have to have that doubt.
*  Right.
*  You have to have a little bit of that.
*  Now, is it this is a this new phase of your life where all of a sudden you reignited and you want to compete again.
*  This has got to be fun.
*  It is fun.
*  Yeah, it is fun.
*  I do say it's fun, but it's still it's apprehensive stuff.
*  Yeah, it's apprehensive, but it's still like you said, it's fun.
*  But it seems so exciting like to watch you train and get ready.
*  It's like to me, I'm like, fuck.
*  Yeah, like what do you want a man to do?
*  What do you want a man to do?
*  Just sit around, do nothing, just wait, go for walks, do whatever the fuck you want.
*  And if you could still do this the way you're doing it, why not?
*  Hey, I don't understand it either, but I want to do it.
*  I don't understand.
*  I just want to do it.
*  And I feel like I was born to do this stuff.
*  Well, you certainly were at one point in time in your life, but you had moved on to a different chapter of your life.
*  You had completely stopped doing that.
*  You were doing a Tyson Ranch thing, smoking a lot of weed.
*  You stopped smoking weed totally?
*  Pretty much, yeah.
*  Pretty much stopped.
*  Yeah, it's going to stop.
*  Wow.
*  Wow, that's a big change right away.
*  But when you do something like this, it's all about change.
*  Listen, you can't continue being a comedian if you're not sharpening your psyche up.
*  Even when you're doing it right here, you're practicing your comedian act.
*  You have to continue to practice.
*  The more you practice it, say if you practice it every four years,
*  you'll be better if you only practice it for a month.
*  So the more you do it, the better you become.
*  Do you feel like that now in this comeback that you're only sort of scratching your potential?
*  Because you're just getting back into shape again.
*  A year from now, you'll be even better shape and you'll be more conditioned to do what you want to do.
*  Like you're in this...
*  God willing, yeah.
*  Yeah, you're in this rebuilding stage now.
*  And now that's exciting.
*  Yeah.
*  When you go to your doctor, these people who have this alternative stuff
*  and you see the development, you see the healing process,
*  and you say, come on, tell me this.
*  Why is this happening to me?
*  Why a guy like me who just got off drugs, who just gave up his life and don't care about nothing,
*  this is happening to him?
*  Since I married my wife, all this good stuff started happening.
*  I'm saying, wow, what is this stuff all about?
*  Whatever it's all about, it's good.
*  I'm really grateful.
*  Take my money.
*  That's what I said.
*  I said, take my money.
*  I want to watch it.
*  Let's see it.
*  And it's not about money because the money is going to be in charity.
*  And it's just about doing something good.
*  And from that perspective, I used to like feeling like I'm doing something good for somebody more than myself.
*  That's a beautiful part of it, yeah, that it is going to go to charity.
*  But it's also an exciting matchup.
*  And I'm watching Roy work out too.
*  And Roy looks fantastic.
*  Roy's going to always look fantastic.
*  He was a little 100 pounds overweight.
*  He's going to look good.
*  He just really looks good when he does this stuff.
*  Roy Jones Jr.
*  I mean, that's one of the things that makes this fight so exciting is that Roy is, like yourself, one of the all-time greats and still looks physically fantastic.
*  Like you see him moving around and hitting the pads.
*  Exactly.
*  Hand speed looks great.
*  And you can't train with anybody that looks like him before they do that stuff.
*  Right.
*  Well, he always had such an unusual style.
*  With very few jabs, he would throw left hooks instead of jabs.
*  Roy always had one of the strangest styles in all the boxing.
*  It was strange, but it was very effective.
*  Super effective, yeah.
*  Very effective.
*  Just incredibly hard to prepare for too because try to find someone who...
*  No one's going to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  No one can emulate him in the gym.
*  Now, when you decided on a fight and decided on a poem, were there other...
*  I heard that someone had offered you Shannon the Cannon Briggs for bare knuckle boxing.
*  No, no.
*  It was just Tyson Fury, with Boxap, Tyson Fury, and quite other guys.
*  But certain things just happened, and it didn't happen.
*  And then it was Holyfield, it was Shannon, it was some other guys from MMA.
*  And then Roy turned out to be the right guy.
*  I guess we did a survey, and Roy popped up the winner.
*  Well, it's certainly a giant name.
*  A giant name.
*  Holyfield on top of Holyfield, one of that.
*  Yeah, Holyfield would be a great one too.
*  But just having a guy like that that has that big name that is also an all-time great, and
*  that also wants to do it too, and to get the public excited.
*  I think it's a perfect fight to get the public excited.
*  Exactly.
*  So do you think that once you fight Roy that that'll be it, or do you think this is just
*  going to be the beginning of this new chapter in your life?
*  I believe this is just going to be the beginning of whatever happens, happens.
*  This is pretty interesting.
*  Being out here talking to you and knowing that the extent of the wave length of people are
*  going to hear this stuff is pretty interesting, because now this is true.
*  It's really going to no longer in my head.
*  I'm stroking it.
*  It's real.
*  It's like, wow.
*  Yeah, it's wow.
*  Yeah, I can't wait, man.
*  I want to be there.
*  I want to see it.
*  Hey, down the street here.
*  I'll come back.
*  I forgot the name of it.
*  The Dignity Center.
*  That's where it's going to be?
*  Yeah.
*  Is it going to be an audience?
*  It can't be an audience yet, right?
*  I don't believe audience.
*  I believe only, I don't know what am I going to say, entourage?
*  They call it family fight group.
*  And this is going to be eight rounds?
*  I believe so, yeah.
*  So how did you arrive on eight rounds?
*  Hey, listen, beat the hell out of me.
*  I wanted to do the exhibition.
*  I wanted to help the people.
*  I said, why do I got to eat fucking rounds by now?
*  I'm getting in condition, and we're going to do this stuff.
*  Well, eight rounds gives you enough time to work.
*  Gives people enough time to get excited about it.
*  When you think about an eight round fight, do you see yourself moving into 10 rounds
*  and 12 rounds in the future?
*  We don't know what the future holds, but we're looking forward to just having fun
*  and doing it for a purpose, a reason.
*  Because people were talking about you literally fighting for the title again.
*  Hey, I'm not interested in it.
*  I'm as interested in fighting for the title of giving.
*  Okay, okay.
*  So just doing this for good.
*  So exciting for you, but also generates a lot of positivity.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, I love that.
*  It feels soul cleaning for some reason.
*  Because you're giving away charity that you're doing something good?
*  I'm doing it for myself.
*  This doesn't do it for me no more.
*  Right.
*  That makes sense.
*  It doesn't do it.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  So it's both things.
*  So you get to excite yourself, challenge yourself, but the good is all going to an excellent cause.
*  I won't have in my mind, oh, I'm getting paid.
*  I just don't want to never have that in my mind again.
*  I just don't want to have, oh, I'm getting something for what I'm doing kind of attitude.
*  Somebody said, and this was kind of hilarious, someone said,
*  hey, I heard that they're just going to just mess around and that they're not going to go for the knockout.
*  I go, do you know who the fuck you're talking about?
*  I go, you're talking about Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr.
*  Do you really believe that?
*  That the two of the all-time greats, once they start throwing hands, that it won't get crazy?
*  Well, of course it is because both of us are who we are and we're going to show our skills
*  and nobody's going to want to look stupid.
*  And it's just going to be interesting, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have any other people in mind?
*  Like, do you have a game plan in mind, like after Roy or are you just thinking only about Roy right now?
*  At this moment only Roy, but it's just some interesting people that we have that I'm going to announce later.
*  Now, there was some talk of you and Roy way back in the day when Roy fought John Ruiz and won the heavyweight title.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  Yeah. So what did you think about that fight back then?
*  I thought it was really interesting because I couldn't use the money back then.
*  So me and Roy talked, we was in Texas and we went to Houston, we went to Houston, we talked,
*  and after we talked we just went out and chilled out, but it was interesting, never happened.
*  I don't know what happened to me, something must have happened to me, and it just didn't happen.
*  That's one of those things, right? There's always all these potential fights that don't quite line up.
*  Do you have other fights in your head that were potential fights that didn't line up that you wish did?
*  No, everything happened for the reason that it's happening now.
*  I'm excited about this fight. I'm excited about this fight stylistically too, because I always liked that fight stylistically.
*  I was so interested in that fight stylistically, it was so interesting because you were just this unstoppable force
*  and Roy was so fast and so slick.
*  I guess I'm just prepared to do a lot of running and chasing.
*  Yeah.
*  That was real difficult to get in condition for.
*  I was like, chasing this little guy around the ring.
*  So how many days a week are you training now?
*  Every day.
*  Every day.
*  I have the Sundays off, so every day.
*  And what is a typical day for Mike Tyson right now?
*  The day starts as soon as it's daylight from 5.30 out through the four mile run.
*  Come back. What am I doing when I come back?
*  I'm back, I'm in the shower. From the shower, I go downstairs, I flip the birds, I fly the birds, come back in.
*  I have a machine where you do the twist for your abs.
*  Ab exercises, yeah.
*  And I'll do that probably 200 times on both sides.
*  And I grab a bite. I'm eating meat for this, I may have some eggs instead of not eating eggs.
*  You were a vegan for a while, right? How long were you vegan for?
*  A couple years.
*  For a couple years?
*  Yeah, five years.
*  When did it stop? When did you stop doing that?
*  I don't know, not too long ago.
*  So did you stop because of the training or did you stop before that?
*  Yeah, I did stop because of the training. It was because of what I wanted my body to look like and the strength that I wanted to possess.
*  So you started eating meat, red meat, everything again?
*  No, no, no. Only elk and bison.
*  Oh, red meat, that's red meat.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I love elk stuff.
*  You're eating elk and bison too. I want to give you some of my elk.
*  Yeah, really, would you please?
*  Fuck yeah, 100%.
*  Would you please man? Did you kill it?
*  Yes, yes.
*  Yeah, I would like for you to do that.
*  I'll give you some from that elk right there.
*  That would be so awesome.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  That would be so awesome, brother.
*  I have three commercial freezers in the back. I would love that. I would love that.
*  When I look at food, I don't look at food like I used to look at it. I look at it for what it's for.
*  Yeah.
*  For what it's for.
*  To take care of the body.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, that's the best meat too.
*  I realize that there's things that are good for other people like the kale and the vegetables and all this stuff, the blueberry.
*  And then for me, it's really poisonous.
*  That stuff's bad for you?
*  Yeah, that stuff's not good for my blood type and my health conditions and all that stuff.
*  Kale? All that stuff's bad for you?
*  Oh, kale will kill me.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's going to kill me. Kale will kill me.
*  What did you do?
*  No, actually dead.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, for me, kale is toxic to my blood and everything.
*  So when you were a vegan, what were you eating?
*  Oh man, nothing.
*  My wife calls me the miserable vegan. That's not veganism what you're doing, Mike.
*  Just being miserable.
*  No, I think it comes down to when...
*  And it's interesting because I've done it when I was with CUSS. I would sometimes just overdo it.
*  Sometimes I go for religious fasts for 30 days, I might overdo it.
*  Sometimes I might not eat for the whole day.
*  Instead of just for the daytime, not eating and eating.
*  Then I might for a couple days just not eat, period.
*  But that's just your championship mentality, right?
*  You're always pushing yourself, even when it comes to something like fasting.
*  It has something to do with suffering. Self-suffering.
*  I don't know what it is. I can't put my feelings on it.
*  I'm always thinking about how long can I suffer more than this person or that person?
*  Could this person do what I did?
*  Right, right, right. I remember you saying that too about training.
*  That you would get up in the morning and train because you wanted an edge.
*  You wanted to know that you were training while they were asleep.
*  Exactly.
*  I remember thinking that back when I was doing martial arts. I remember reading that.
*  I'm like, I want to do that too. I copy a lot of shit you did.
*  Well, you always have to have... And even if it's not su-so, you have to have...
*  And that's where delusion comes in because delusion is only delusional
*  when you don't accomplish the goal of making your delusion the reality.
*  That's what is delusional.
*  You're just enforcing your mindset.
*  Oh yeah, to allow those delusions to be the reality of your excessment.
*  Now, when you're doing this and you're getting up in the morning and running,
*  do you feel like you felt in the old days?
*  I don't mean physically, I mean the mind. You're preparing for war again.
*  Does this reignite those old thoughts the way you were when you were the champ?
*  The way you were when you were on your way to the title?
*  This is a whole new way of life.
*  You know what's really interesting?
*  That sometimes... Period.
*  It's not real, but sometimes I struggle with the fact of why is it possible
*  that I can really hurt somebody.
*  Like you don't want to hurt them?
*  What do you mean by you struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them?
*  That is sometimes... It's orgasmic sometimes.
*  Like some fights, like particularly Tyrell Biggs or someone that you had problems with,
*  someone that you had animosity towards, so when you finally get your hands on them.
*  Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you rekt? What does that mean?
*  That's a good question. It means you're getting excited.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's going through your mind right now?
*  Well, that's how I get when I was a kid. Sometimes I get the twinkle.
*  The twinkle?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what I'm saying. It's like you reached a state as a human being,
*  as a champion, as a ferocious fighter. You reached a state of ability
*  and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever touch and feel.
*  That's why I'm asking you when you're running, when you're hitting the bag,
*  when that heart's beating again and you know who you are, you're Mike motherfucking Tyson.
*  So when you're doing all this shit again, you're still Mike Tyson.
*  Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again. It's got to be pretty wild.
*  I don't know. It's wild, but I believe it's rightfully so to be that way.
*  I don't think I mastered it, but I just know how to deal with it. I don't let it overwhelm me.
*  No. Well, of course not. But saying that gets you orgasmic, that's a strange thing to say.
*  Well, that's just what I wanted to find out because you're really bright.
*  And I thought you were serious. No, I'm being very serious.
*  No, I know. I know you're being serious, but I mean, no one will understand that other than you.
*  Like that's your mindset. But I think that like all the things we were talking about before,
*  the way you drive yourself, the way you push yourself, the way you put yourself into that frame of mind,
*  no one's going to understand that other than you.
*  So no one's going to understand you getting an erection from thinking about hurting someone more than you will.
*  There has to be fear-based in somewhere. Fear-based? Maybe.
*  Or maybe just, maybe not fear-based, but maybe embracing the fact that you're going to go into this
*  with everything that you have, the chaos of it all. And the ultimate goal is to hurt somebody.
*  The ultimate goal is to be extremely successful. The way you can be extremely successful,
*  the thing you do great is to crush people. So to have that encompass everything.
*  This fighting is the only thing I don't ask Allah for. I just don't ask Him for help for that.
*  You don't ask Him for help for fighting because you think you got it.
*  No, I just don't think. You don't think you should ask?
*  I just don't want to be involved with that kind of mindset in Allah.
*  So, you know, people do, they go to, I just don't. I just don't because it's just, I don't like the way I think.
*  I don't want Allah to be involved with the way I think at that time.
*  Well, this is what's so interesting to me about you fighting again because of the conversation that we had the last time you were here,
*  that you didn't want to reignite your ego. Clearly, your ego is blazing right now. I mean, you're ready to go.
*  Well, maybe because I'm an addict, a former addict, and I'm on a narcotic ring, the camera's on me.
*  This is a big narcotic and maybe that has something to do with it as well.
*  But I like to think it's under control until the night of the event.
*  Yeah, the night of the event. So the addiction will get purged with the performance.
*  Yeah, that's why, you know, I was doing, if you don't mind me interrupting for a second,
*  I was, the book that talks to you, what do they call it, audio book, and it was called The Gene Key.
*  Okay.
*  This book, and the book was explaining about why, that we are, who we are in that perspective,
*  that most of the people like you and myself and people, people in general who is not at that level,
*  even anyone that have a creative mind is victimized to depression.
*  And the reason is because when that creative, when that moment, whatever it is that causes that creativity
*  is not fed the proper information that is successful and that is accepted in whatever space of the brain
*  and the mind that it wants to be accepted and is not accepted, it crumbles.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Well, I feel like with someone like you, the highs that you reach in competing,
*  the highs you reach in fighting are so high that it's probably very difficult to,
*  it's probably very difficult to just exist outside of that.
*  And I know you love pot for that reason because it calmed you down and mellowed you out and chilled you out.
*  Absolutely. It made me like myself. Do you understand that?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  It makes me like myself.
*  It gives you forgiveness of yourself.
*  Yeah, I agree with that. I never thought about that.
*  I never wanted to be forgiven much because that's really powerful stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  To have to accept forgiveness is really powerful.
*  And to forgive yourself. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's hard to forgive other people. Sometimes it's harder to forgive yourself.
*  Yes.
*  And marijuana makes you feel, it makes me more compassionate.
*  It makes me more friendly. It makes me want to hug people.
*  It gives me more of a sense of community.
*  Exactly. It makes me like people who I believe did something wrong to me.
*  Yeah, you're like, ah, he didn't fuck me.
*  It's okay. He's a good nigga, right? He's my man.
*  Yeah, it's like he didn't mean it. He's just all fucked up just like me.
*  Oh man. But if I'm drunk, I'm going to blow that brain out of my mouth.
*  Oh God.
*  The fighting thing, to feed that, that experience, it's a different experience.
*  And it's got to be so hard for a world championship fighter of your caliber to exist with regular, normal, boring life.
*  When you're training and you're ramping yourself up for a big fight, and then you have that big fight,
*  and you knock out Spinks in front of the whole world, and you're walking around the ring, and you're on the cover of every magazine,
*  the highs of that, the accomplishment, the training, and then the competing itself,
*  the experience is so alien to most people that when you walk around with regular folks in regular life, it's got to be hard to exist.
*  No, it's not. It's just that you have to know who you can be at certain times in your life.
*  No one knows who they are. Because if you knew who you were right now, you'd be really limited.
*  Because life is about change. Then five years from now, you'd be a different person, won't be this person.
*  So we're going to have to develop some kind of emotional intelligence and just learn to, as time goes on,
*  grasp what's ever going on and just form with it as it changes, you change with it.
*  Because it's very difficult when times change to change with the times.
*  And you have to be conscious of that. And the times is not the people around you.
*  The time is the development and time you have left on this planet that you have to develop who you are.
*  How difficult is it to make that change though, to become a different person other than a world championship fighter?
*  Like when you decided to stop, was it difficult?
*  Well, time will make you that person.
*  Time will.
*  Yeah, time will make you that person. What is time? I don't know.
*  Right. But time has also made you that person again now though.
*  Now it's reignited. Now new time has come and now you're training again.
*  Exactly. But I think this is done mostly for my health, for my immortality more than anything.
*  Subconsciously I think that's what the reason why I did it, just to be healthy.
*  To get changed, to be healthy.
*  Yeah, and then this stuff goes on and this and then I meet a doctor and they say,
*  hey, you know, you should do this and this and you should try stem cell.
*  You never try stem cell. But this is what really got me interested in this stuff.
*  I interviewed, which I like to do you as well, on my podcast.
*  If you're licensed to do it, your contact won't let you do it.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  So I had the opportunity to talk to Ken Shamrock.
*  Okay.
*  And so he came in and I looked at him and I said, fuck, he looks incredible.
*  What the fuck? Hey, what are you doing right now? Why do you look like that?
*  How's that happen? And he said it was in Columbia and I said, where?
*  I'm going tomorrow. Right?
*  But I had some people nearby that I happened to be introduced to and they were on,
*  they're on the top. Are they really?
*  Is that that bio accelerator place down in Columbia? Is that what it is?
*  I didn't go there.
*  Is that where Henry Cejudo went?
*  I have no idea who went there. I have no idea where it is. I used to know it was in Columbia.
*  And I met some other people who were just on top of their game with this anti-age and all this stuff that's going on with this alternative stuff also.
*  And so I met these people and it was just amazing stuff.
*  So you're able to now train all these days a week. You have like how many months in now? You're solid since April.
*  Yes.
*  And you attribute that mostly to all these different alternative methods of healing and recovery?
*  Absolutely. Especially, this gentleman that we call, his name is Brad Rowe. We call him the mechanic, the electrician that is.
*  And he works through current forces and that was just-
*  Electromuscular stimulation and those things?
*  It's different. It's totally different. It's in that family, but it's just totally superior than that.
*  That's just so antiquated compared to this stuff.
*  So you were talking about your ability to, you run in the morning and now what's the afternoons like? What are you doing in the afternoons?
*  That's when I'm training. Around one o'clock I'm in the gym. I'm doing the training.
*  2.30 I'm probably talking on the phone and flipping some deals, making arrangements probably to do other shows, commercial, some ads and just stuff.
*  Business shit.
*  Yeah, business stuff.
*  How did you get hooked up with Rafael Cordero? Because for folks who don't know, he's a legendary trainer in MMA.
*  He's from Shoot the Box in Brazil. He was one of the top guys back when Shoot the Box was the number one MMA camp in Brazil where Anderson Silva and Vanderlei Silva-
*  I found this out later, but this is how this happened. The two of us met. I said, hey, you know, I like to hit the mitts.
*  You think I can hit the mitts with somebody? You think you got somebody around to hit the mitts?
*  I was getting ready to go to Freddie's gym.
*  Freddie Roach?
*  Yeah, and then someone said they had Rafael. And I said, okay, let me check him out. And he was just perfect.
*  Is he near you? Does he live near you or something?
*  He lives in Laguna. I'm in Newport. What is another? Laguna?
*  Close enough. Yeah, that's close. That's real close.
*  So he's there, I believe.
*  He's a great trainer.
*  We just came from Vegas. We're just hanging out. Had to go someplace. And he's just cool. Cool.
*  I met him before the pandemic, but that's what I mean. We came before the pandemic. We were in Vegas.
*  We met, I guess, at one of the UFC fights. And then I met him over here and I was saying I want to hit the mitts. And that's how we got back together.
*  He's a great man, like a good person.
*  No, the reason why I kept him up, because he was awesome with the mitts, because he put so much peace and love and stuff to the whole family.
*  He's a beautiful man. His image, his energy is just awesome.
*  Yeah, he's got great energy. He's beloved. And the MMA world and all the people that he trains with, everyone loves Rafael Cordero.
*  You can't find a person to say a bad word about that, man.
*  Oh man, he's so awesome.
*  And he's a very good trainer. And he also was a guy, that style, that shootbox style, that was very aggressive.
*  And I was like, oh, that actually makes sense, him and you together.
*  Yeah, when we do drills, the drills are what's going on. When we're hitting the mitts, it's no use, hey, hit the mitts, pop, pop, pop. It's boom, we're moving. It's all that action, boom.
*  Heart beating, heart beating, heart breathing, and we're just working at it.
*  Yeah, I'm watching and I'm saying this is interesting because he's got you doing a lot of side to side and angles.
*  Oh yeah, listen, I do eight rounds in the bag and I do four rounds with me and her movement and I'm like, oh, you feel that heart go.
*  What was that bag, was that even really workout? Was that really even a workout? What was that to warm me up for this? What was that about? You don't even know that existed after you did those four or five rounds.
*  So when you go from April when you first started doing it again to now, how much better do you feel?
*  Listen, that was just a joke at the beginning. Right now it's really perking up.
*  It feels like real training.
*  Yeah, it does. It's taking that deep breath.
*  Do you feel like you could train as hard as you did back when you were in your prime?
*  Well, listen, you have a tape here, don't you, that we can look at?
*  Is there a film? Did someone send something over?
*  Do you have a film of me hitting the mitts in my prime and see me hitting the mitts now?
*  I bet we do. I bet you can find it. Somebody must have.
*  Well, you look at me hit the mitts in 88 and let me hit the mitts from last weekend. You tell me.
*  No, listen, I'll tell you. You look fucking fantastic. That's what's interesting about it.
*  I blew me. I said, wow, that's me. I said, look at this. It's just I had more endurance back then than now, but now I'm catching up.
*  Well, that's what it's interesting about it. It's not like watching an old fighter that has lost it.
*  That's just trying to compete. It's like watching an old fighter regain those old skills.
*  Like you look great, man. That's what's crazy about it.
*  I'm just going to work on this and work off it and keep working on it and see where this goes.
*  It's so exciting. I love it. I love it.
*  When I announced the listen, this is Johnny Ryan, the guy that works with us and Aeros and stuff.
*  When we announced the fights, he got we got in two point five billion hits.
*  I'm serious. I believe it. I believe it. No, this is going to be a huge fight.
*  I mean, this fight is probably going to be one of the biggest fights of all time in terms of pay per view, in terms of people buying it and watching it.
*  And in terms of helping people as well of Roy and you training together, there's a compilation.
*  It looks like somebody's speeding my god damn. My mother in law said they speed that up and my wife said they.
*  I said, no, I think they did not. That's the electrician.
*  Oh, the the electrical muscular stimulation shit. Yeah.
*  Yeah. No, it doesn't look like it's sped up. It looks like you still have a speed. That's what it looks like.
*  That's what's so exciting about it. What a Kings MMA shirt on.
*  Yes. It's so exciting. It's so exciting, man. It really is.
*  I'm I'm 100 percent into this and I can't wait for the fight to go down. It's going to be November 18th now. Right.
*  28th. 28th. 28th. November 28th. Oh, that's it.
*  It was enough time for fans and everybody in Thanksgiving to be home and they'd be able to view it for the holidays and just be able to help more people.
*  More people that view it. This is so exciting, man.
*  Now, are you doing weightlifting? Are you doing any swimming? Like what are the kind of exercises you're doing?
*  The only swim I did was when that shark commercial. That was the only swim I did. I was going to ask you about that.
*  And we're doing a little weight. We're doing a lot of reps and just doing a lot of.
*  So you have a strength and conditioning coach? Yeah, Brad Rowe.
*  Okay, so he's doing. Yeah. Yeah. Brad Rowe. I've heard that name before.
*  Weightlifting champ. Chain weightlifting champs and all that stuff. And he's just an awesome person. We just kick him butt.
*  And how many days a week are you doing strength and conditioning along with your running and boxing training?
*  I think from Monday to Friday. I think we do Saturdays too. I say, hey, I'm bored. Let's just go Saturday and work out.
*  Wow. How good does it feel to get back in shape again, man, and to look great?
*  Hey, it feels awesome, but listen, there's nothing easy about it. You know, getting in shape is not easy.
*  It's just it's continuous stuff. It's consistency. There it is. Big old, big old Brad.
*  So how the fuck did they talk you into getting in the ocean with sharks? What was that all about?
*  Listen, I don't know how they did this. The money wasn't really that great. You know, and I'm sorry, shark world.
*  Your guys underpaid me and they had me out there. I was there and it was really interesting, man. It was really interesting.
*  I'm just saying how did these guys get me in here? Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.
*  And listen, Dana thought he was doing me. I don't want Mike to fail. I'm telling Mike to do a couple of games with these guys.
*  And I'm saying thanks a lot, Dana. You really like Dana really like me. I'm saying Dana really cares about me.
*  He said, forget the fire. I want to see my fire. I want to see Mike go fuck with some sharks.
*  Yeah, I would I would say fighting is probably safer. Dana didn't want you to fight, right?
*  Yeah, but he wants me to go with sharks. No. Why didn't he want you to fight? Did you talk to him about it?
*  No, he has never seen it until he's seen it and watched me. Once he saw you, then he changed his mind.
*  Yeah. Once I think when someone sees the dedication that you have that you're actually fit, you're actually moving fast and you actually can compete at a very high level.
*  I just had to realize that I'm not going to rush in there like that no more. I got to move around. I got to do it in a different way.
*  I tried to go in and the first time it was a disaster. So I went in there thinking, using my head, moving and things went the way I wanted.
*  How long in training was the first time you sparred? First time I sparred? 15 years.
*  First time you sparred in 15 years and how many months into training was that? You started in April. So when did you start sparring?
*  Really boxing stuff, box boxing stuff is when I did that stuff with Rafael. First time.
*  Right, but I mean first sparring rounds. Yeah, it was really weird and stuff. But I realized when I was getting hit, boom, boom, boom, I got hit a couple of times.
*  I didn't go like, what the fuck am I doing? I said, wait, I belong here. It brought it back. Yeah, I said I belong here. I got rock, boom, boom, boom.
*  I got rock and I heard the ring and boom. I said, boom, I didn't panic. I said, oh, I belong here. Wow.
*  I belong here. I started moving and started talking about it. I said, whoa, I belong here. Nice. I never said, what the fuck am I doing?
*  This shit is crazy. It just never happened. It never happened. I was expecting that. You were expecting the what the fuck am I doing?
*  Fuck this shit. Hey, stop. Fuck this shit, nigga. I ain't doing this shit. But that's what I was expecting really. But I said, whoa, boom, boom, boom, boom. Whoa, I belong here.
*  Then you felt it and you readjusted. The first thing I said, I said, whoa, I belong here. Nice.
*  Nice. How long did it take before you started feeling comfortable sparring? The next time I sparred again. Really? Yeah.
*  So the next time you sparred again, you just could get back into the mindset of what it's like to be competing and moving with another person.
*  Yeah. And you can't go for the kill because your body's not moving for the kill. Now you have to develop the relationship. This is going to be interesting when you hear this.
*  And the fighter probably doesn't understand that, but as he gets older, you have to develop, reacquaint a relationship with your mind and your body.
*  Your legs go here before your body's ready to go with it sometimes. They have to sync up. Yeah, they have to sync up.
*  Now you have to talk. Hey, before we were like, ween, ween, ween. Before you were like, let's do it. Bing, bing, bing. Now you're like, hey, let's move here. Let's move here.
*  You have to talk. You lose that tenth of a second when you talk to yourself. So you're doing it instantly.
*  So do you think eventually you'll get back to automatic? Well, we're going to see. I don't like that. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that too.
*  It's exciting though, man. It's very exciting to see you sparring again, to see all that.
*  When you're sparring, are you sparring technically? Are you sparring hard? Like how's sparring?
*  Listen, the first time I went back sparring, I tried to go all out and that was disastrous. My body wasn't listening.
*  And so like you said, I had to develop that relationship. And the second time I sparring, that was so much better.
*  I went in Russia and tried to hurt nobody, kill nobody. We were just trying to accomplish stuff. Just get working.
*  And how often do you spar in a week? When I go back to sparring, I like sparring every day. Really? Every day.
*  Yeah, because the more you do it, the better it is. Right, the more your timing is, the better you feel.
*  What are your thoughts on like some people think that you can spar too much and you leave too much in the gym because you get hit too much in camp?
*  Well, that's the whole thing you learn in camp, not to get hit. That's the art of boxing, learning not to get hit in the fight.
*  And you have to do that by trying to get hit in the gym, real seriously and avoiding that. And then it turns out in the fight.
*  So you shouldn't be in the gym saying, I've been hit too much because you shouldn't get hit because that should be the objective of fighting, not to get hit as much as you believe you are.
*  What do you say to a fighter that sees themselves getting hit too much though in sparring? Do you tell them to take some time off or do you say?
*  You know what I say? I try to teach him how not to avoid those punches. And if he doesn't, I don't really want to have much to do with somebody because I don't want to be involved with somebody getting hit and getting hurt and stuff like that.
*  Well, I know you were doing a lot of coaching of just even little small sessions with different fighters. And there's a bunch of stuff on the internet. Did you think about doing that in the future?
*  No, not at this moment. It just takes a really special person to do that. You got to be a mother, a father, a psychiatrist, a dietitian. It's just so many hats you have to wear and be a trainer.
*  A good trainer, a true trainer to yourself and your fighters. It's just a lot of hats that's really overwhelming for me and my personality.
*  I totally can understand that. But I would also imagine that in your mind there's some knowledge that I would love to see passed on to other fighters in a way like a trainer, only a trainer can do.
*  Yeah, I'm the kind of guy, you want to learn from me, you got to learn from me. Let me talk to you or something because I'm not like Cus. Cus would never get tired answering questions.
*  Sometimes my son asks me, why do you guys ask so many questions? Because that's the way I was with Cus. But I'm not Cus. Cus would never get tired. He would love to answer all my questions.
*  Because Cus wanted the perception that he knew everything and you should listen to him and take his advice because he knew everything.
*  That's what it's like. If you was his friend you always came to him for advice. He always wanted to give his advice and let you know that he was a superior thinker and that you should come to him and settle your problems. That's just what he was.
*  Do you ever think back on your life? Your life with Cus and the origin story is almost like a movie. It's almost too crazy.
*  No, no, no. Let me tell you what happened. I'm in Sparfit, detention for boys. And Muhammad Ali, they showed the movie to Gray. This is like 77, 76, I'm 11 years old. They played Ali and then Ali walks in and talks to the kids.
*  And I saw him and I saw everybody going crazy. I want to be like him. And from there I go upstate New York. There's a guy that used to be a professional boxer named Bobby Stewart.
*  Mr. Stewart taught me how to box and eventually he said I want to introduce you. He took me upstairs and I'm a custom model. This is all in a couple of months since I've seen Ali. And now I'm training to be a boxer.
*  Crazy. And you were 13, right?
*  No, I was, I would think I was 13, yeah.
*  Look, that's like a movie.
*  It was, no. I knew I was going to be successful. I knew everything was going to go right. I knew it. It was in my blood. I was only a kid, but I said I want to be like that guy. And it just started working.
*  And it's such an amazing...
*  Listen, not even three or four months after I saw Ali, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, I met him. I'm in one place. I had a fight trying to stab a guy and I did it with a pencil or something. I go from there and I go over to this bad place, come on, Elmwood, this cottage.
*  This cottage, that's where Bobby stood because he's a fighter and he had to take care of these. All the staff, they're big straw men because they have to take care of these very interesting kids, you know, like homicidal kids. These are kids, but they're really wild.
*  And so that's the job. We're in the wild. We're in the bad college, the lockup college, Elmwood. And so we have the bad image. That's the crazy kid college gets the lockdown. No one can go outside like we. They got to be handcuffed when they leave the cottage and stuff.
*  And so that's where I've gotten my tutelage. That's where I learned to go to school. That's why I've learned everything in this bad boy place, this place where all the bad kids at.
*  And since they had to have extreme kind of guards, their security, Mr. Stewart was a professional boxer and he would teach the kids how to box, that they behave themselves and got them on a certain level in which you can go back there and box.
*  And guys were coming back to the dome. I was locked up. I was on the level to go to because I had just got there. So they put me in the back to lock you up to see what kind of person you are. So they put you in the group.
*  And I see these guys coming back with their eyes busted, teeth knocked out, their ribs sore, but they were happy. They're laughing about this.
*  They're laughing about this. Yo, he fucked you up. Yo, baby, you almost got him. And I see, yo, what's going on and what's happening?
*  And they see how we fight Mr. Stewart, boxing Mr. Stewart and stuff. And they're happy with them bleeding, tooth knocked out. But they were happy and they were enthusiastic.
*  I said, I wanted to do that too because I wanted to be tough. And so Mr. Stewart, I talked to him. He didn't want to teach me. So I started cleaning and being a real nice kid to everybody because I wanted to learn how to box because all the kids were happy.
*  And he started teaching me how to box.
*  It's crazy that you met Cuss too because out of all the people that you could meet, no one was better at the psychological level.
*  Oh, I would never have been the champ if I wasn't for Cuss because he put stuff in my mind. I started thinking about myself being these people visualizing myself being, I don't know, great or somebody. I've never done that in my life.
*  I've never heard, not even in the ghetto, somebody say this. Like I said, wow, he's great. Like I'm talking about like Holmes. I said, wow, he's incredible.
*  Why is he incredible? I don't think he's that incredible. Why shouldn't you have that? Why should he have that and not you? I've never heard somebody say that to me.
*  But Cuss was a master at the psychological level.
*  Master. Like you just, you would hear him talk about things, just reading the things that he's written about, about the psychology of fighting. He was the perfect guy for you. It was almost like the stars aligned.
*  That's what I'm talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  It really is like a movie. It really is like it all lined up. And plus, physically, you were so unusual. You were so unusual, so gifted. I mean, even when you were young.
*  Oh no, everybody told him that he can't be too small. No way in the world he can be too short because he's too small. He's got to be 225, 230.
*  Well, obviously they were wrong.
*  Big time.
*  But it was also, you might have been short, but you had the best style and Cuss developed that with you, the best style to deal with the fact that you were shorter. The bobbing and the weaving, the constant pressure.
*  Exactly. But I believe style is relevant. I believe it's the morale behind the style. I think success in fighting and life is about desire and the will.
*  Yeah.
*  The fact that you won it, is it worth dying for? That's the true greatness, the willingness to die. So is this thing worth greatness?
*  The mindset that he instilled in you and the way he gave you the tools in order to think about things in a way that fueled that mindset.
*  Yeah, but that doesn't do good in the real world though. It's really disastrous in the real world.
*  Right, right.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  That is true, right?
*  To deal with that too, yeah.
*  Isn't that crazy? It's like the very thing that made you special could fuck you in the real world.
*  Oh, the real world. Guys like that go to prison. They don't exist in the real world. They gotta take them out of there.
*  It's crazy.
*  They have to remove them from the real world, those kind of people like myself.
*  Isn't that what's crazy? Like that's where the crazy adjustment has to come in, where you have to learn how to be, and that's where cannabis helped you a lot too.
*  Oh man, forget it.
*  Forget it, forget it.
*  But now you're not smoking any weed getting ready for this fight.
*  No, no.
*  Do you miss it?
*  Well, I understand the discipline of this stuff, but what I don't like about it is that without cannabis, it doesn't matter to me. I just get mean.
*  I don't like the mean stuff. I don't like how I may snap at my wife or my kids. That's what I don't like.
*  Right.
*  What?
*  Right, right.
*  I see the sparkle in your eye again. It's a little different right now than the last time I was talking to you.
*  There's a little more intensity going on, but it's also you're ramping up.
*  Yeah, you know, I'm just always, I'm sometimes, I get beside myself and I forget that I have to be grateful for what I love, what God did in general, and sometimes I get caught up into my ego.
*  Right.
*  It's just a struggle, but I'm working on it. I never worked on it before, so that's a start.
*  Right.
*  I never considered working on it.
*  But that is the thing, right? What gets you to be a championship level fighter can really fuck you up the rest of your life.
*  Oh, I can't believe it. I'm so happy my wife is still with me. I'm just very grateful because I'm just useless and stuff. I have to learn how to live life. Life from disasters and living life. Oh, fucking joke.
*  I get it, man.
*  You would never believe. I'm using these nice words and I'm conducting myself. You come to my nice house and you would say this guy is just uncouth neanderthal.
*  You know, so I just listen to my wife and people think it's stupid. I listen to this, right? So she told me before I came in, be kind and be nice to everyone. Be kind and nice.
*  Because I don't eat most of the time. I only eat after we're in the... If I don't eat enough, she says she's going to get angry. Can you please eat? So she's forcing me to eat this stuff for Friday and this. And so I said, okay, I eat. But she's right because of the time. We've been married 11 years.
*  You got a good one then, man. You got someone who balances you out. Someone who understands you. Yeah.
*  I don't know. Listen, I was talking to her. So you know, sometimes I think about we're together and this is going to be over. One of us is going to die before the other one. I would not know what to do if you died first.
*  And I had to take care of these kids because her whole life is me and all my kids. Her life is me and not only the two kids that we have, but her life is me and all my kids.
*  Right. And I would just love her and marry her just for that alone. No pussy, no passion, no sex. That alone.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's beautiful, man. To find someone who balances you out like that.
*  Absolutely.
*  But that, what we were talking about, where the very fire that gets you to be Mike Tyson, that turns you into this destroyer inside the ring, if you don't learn how to control it, we'll fuck you up in every other aspect.
*  For instance, after my one round fights, some of them caused me loss because right after that, you think I'm calmed down. You think after 30 seconds or 45 seconds, hey, he's cool. After one round, everything's cool. He's happy. It's over.
*  It's still ringing. It's revving up. It's still revved. It's not finished. It's not dead. The energy's not dead. Not the energy that you jet. The energy of hurting somebody or continuing to hit somebody. It's revved up.
*  So the first thing you hear that indicates altercation is not, hey, what? It's just off. You have no control over it.
*  And it's almost like you're insane. Like, why can I stop this? Why is this happening to me? Why am I in jail right now?
*  And you're Mike Tyson, so it's not like anybody can tell you not to do it or anybody can tell you to shut up or calm down. You're not going to listen to anybody. You're the fucking king of the world.
*  But it just gets crazy when the people in the jail and prison know you real well. They're familiar with you. Like, when they see you, they're not excited now. They get really familiar with you.
*  Jamie Foxx is going to play you in a movie.
*  That's going to be interesting. That's going to be interesting.
*  That's wild. If anybody can do it, Jamie Foxx can do it. That's a talented man.
*  He's really good at what he does. I agree.
*  He's fucking talented. That guy can do anything. He's one of those dudes. You listen to him sing. You hear him play music. You see him do stand-up comedy. Then you see him act. You're like, this fucking guy can do anything.
*  He's just one of those dudes that can just lock in on something and he can do anything.
*  Yo, listen, when the light is on you, when the universe puts the light on you, there's nothing stronger than a person whose time has come. It's all about the light, man. All of us get it.
*  You may not think the homeless man in the corner, the blind and paralyzed guy that's begging in the cup. We all get that moment of shine. We all get it. Feelings, performance, whatever it is, we all get it.
*  Now, when Jamie is playing you, what does that feel like? I know Michael Jai white played you once. Did you talk to him about that?
*  No, I didn't know him or anything. I was in jail when this guy was doing this stuff.
*  Do you know Michael Jai?
*  I met him a few times.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He appears to be.
*  Very, very nice guy. I've known him for a long time and very respectful guy, too. But was it weird watching someone play you?
*  No.
*  No?
*  No, no. It's just that ego shit kicks in, so I'm watching it. And he had some good qualities in it. He did some really good stuff that I thought. But the stuff that he did that represented me, I don't think people even picked up on it.
*  Like what kind of stuff?
*  It's the way he moved his head.
*  Yeah.
*  People don't know I crack my neck all the time.
*  What was that about? You were always doing that.
*  I don't know what had happened. When I had foot bone crushers, Smithy had hit me and the next thing I know I had a crick in my eye. My neck was messed up, so I had to go into chiropractic. I don't know what the heck was wrong with it.
*  So that was where it came from?
*  The nerves.
*  So was that from the bone crusher Smith fight?
*  Well that's where I started doing it.
*  Oh wow.
*  I had some nerves. The nerves, I was like, ah.
*  Did you ever have neck problems? Like you needed surgery?
*  Yeah, I had surgery on my neck. You know the why? You remember when I used to do those rolls on my head?
*  Yes.
*  The football roll? They destroyed me.
*  Bridges. They destroy your neck.
*  I would do them, this is the inch, I would do them for three minutes, then stop a minute, do them for three minutes. I'd do them for five or six or eight rounds. And as time went on they just beat me up.
*  That gave you a crazy fucking neck though, man. Your neck used to start at your temples and just go straight down.
*  For fighting you need a good neck.
*  Are you doing anything to strengthen your neck now?
*  Yes, I have the weight stuff.
*  You ever use an iron neck? Do you know that device?
*  Tell me about that. No.
*  It's a halo. I'll give you one. I have one in the back. It's a halo. You put it on, you pump it up, it fits around your head, and then it's got a bungee cord on it. So you back up like this, the bungee cord's 50 pounds, and then you do these.
*  And because it doesn't do this with your neck, it doesn't put pressure on the discs. So it doesn't move the discs in an unnatural way with the weight.
*  This way?
*  Yeah, because you can do all these different exercises on it, but it doesn't ever bend your discs. So it strengthens the neck without doing damage to your discs.
*  That sounds interesting. You know what, I would love that. Thank you, I really appreciate it.
*  I have a treadmill that you have to put on some shorts first, and then you zip it.
*  Oh, in the water?
*  No, it's not water. You put on some shorts, and you zip the shorts with the plastic that covers the machine, and you start running. And then you can run a fast game, you won't feel anything.
*  But it's not water inside of it?
*  No, it's running a treadmill. It's under plastic, and it's zipped up around you.
*  This thing right here? Zero gravity treadmill? Is that it?
*  That's what it is, yeah.
*  How's that working?
*  That's pretty awesome. You don't feel anything, then you take the pants off. You feel all the sex, the pulling them in, fall to the floor.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's really cool.
*  So this way it doesn't beat up your joints.
*  Yeah, but listen, this is what people don't understand. Yeah, you have a machine that don't beat up, but when you're running outside, the high of running outside is almost worth messing your joints up.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, but the high you get from running outside?
*  What's the difference between the high you get from running outside?
*  You never felt that running?
*  I do, I do run outside, but what do you feel?
*  Man, it's just, I can't even articulate it. Between being outside running and it's like night and day.
*  So like-
*  Being inside a house on a treadmill and being outside running, it's like night and day. You can't even compare the two.
*  Is it because you're moving, you're traveling distance? Is it because you're breathing in the fresh air?
*  It's a spiritual difference. It's just a spiritual difference. Running, hearing the birds, hearing the, whatever it is, the animal's running through breaking the sticks and the weeds, you know, you're just conscious of everything.
*  Right, it's real running as opposed to just exercise on a machine.
*  Exactly. Even if you have a headphone on, you're still conscious of everything out there.
*  Now, have you talked to Jamie Foxx?
*  Yeah.
*  While he's getting ready to do this?
*  I talk to Jamie periodically all the time. We don't even talk about the film.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, we don't talk about it.
*  Now, he's getting bulked up too. He's getting jacked. He looks huge.
*  He's way too finished.
*  When is this supposed to take place?
*  Whenever he's ready, I guess.
*  Wow, that's wild. So when he gets ready to do it, is he going to hang out with you and try to take on your mannerisms?
*  Well, he's known for quite a long time, so he knows my mannerism. He's not going to- if I died, he can do me.
*  Right, right.
*  Pretty much. He wouldn't have to be around me.
*  Do you want to help him? Do you want to give him any pointers or anything?
*  Whatever he wants, whatever areas and what direction he needs me to help him in. Yeah.
*  That's a great-
*  I'm capable of doing it, yeah.
*  If you're going to have someone play you, I think he's the perfect person.
*  He's just good. There's other guys too, but he just knows the real- he has been there.
*  It's hard to get a guy that's just 20 years old and then we're going to have him portrayed as a 25.
*  He just never get it right. When somebody understands the environment that they lived in at that particular time,
*  and they create that environment again in their mind once they're under the influence of that person they're portraying,
*  Jamie's going to get some, knock it out the park.
*  No, he'll knock it out the park for sure.
*  He understands that environment and that chemistry he's going to reconnect.
*  Now, are you going to be a consultant on this move or anything to make sure that it's all legit?
*  Listen, Jamie will be around me. He'll discuss it with me. I'm sure we have that taken care of as well.
*  But we're just going to work this out the best way possible for both of us, I believe.
*  Now, when is that? Is it supposed to follow you when you're a young man or is it supposed to be you as a champion?
*  Well, we're not going to talk about that right now. It's going to be a bunch of stuff, but you don't really dig it.
*  I'm going to tell them some really interesting stuff.
*  So you're saying that the running outside, it's worth it just for the spiritual difference. It's worth the beating up on the joints.
*  Does it fuck with your joints? Do you have knee problems or ankle problems these days?
*  Yeah, I do, but the guys I work with, they take care of that right away.
*  It's almost like, I don't know, it's like, I want to say healing like I'm 18, but it's almost like putting super glue on your joints.
*  Like super glue on your joints, you get stuck in your finger, like, oh fuck, I got the super glue.
*  Remember that time you put it on your finger, you get stuck in your finger, you're like, God, you can't get it off.
*  It's like super glue on your joints.
*  It's interesting what they can do today. You could heal and recover way better than you ever could before.
*  There was no 54-year-old men that looked like you when we were kids.
*  No, no. Jack Elane was the only one.
*  Yeah, and even Jack Elane, I mean, he was kind of fit, but he was just fit because he was disciplined, because he continued to exercise deep into his 90s.
*  Well, discipline is what it's all about. I don't care how good you are in anything. You don't have discipline. You ain't nobody.
*  Right.
*  You're nothing without discipline, because you give up in the slightest struggle without discipline.
*  100%. And that has to be something that you also learn from Cuss as well.
*  I don't know what discipline is. I don't know what discipline is. He taught me discipline is doing what you hate to do, but doing it like you love it.
*  Ah.
*  Doing what you hate to do, but do it like you love it. That is a great quote.
*  And if you can do that, you could be successful in anything.
*  You normally are. You'd be the best janitor in the history of janitors.
*  Yeah.
*  And I use that for a perspective, not just putting those janitors down.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the best of it.
*  I know what you're saying. When all is said and done, I would love it if someone sat down with you and made maybe a book of all the things that Cuss taught you.
*  I don't know. All the things that Cuss taught me nowadays would not be cool.
*  In what way?
*  I don't know. Cuss was born in 1908. In 1908, they had a different opinion of people having opinions like women and stuff like that.
*  And Cuss believing that he cared for the down-traded people and this and that for the blacks and Latinos and Irish people who were being abused by the Irish people of that time, which is crazy.
*  He really was that guy. He was the guy that fought for the people that didn't have anyone to fight for them.
*  He was just that guy. He wanted to be that person. He wanted to be a person that people looked up to. And he was the boss and stuff.
*  He was just wanted to be a person. And when I read his book and I ran around to the bottom, he was successful his whole life.
*  He was always the guy in the neighborhood that people came through to settle beef and talk things over with and loan people stuff and help people out.
*  And he liked being in that position of being able to teach people something, what he believed was teaching them something.
*  He knew so much about the human mind.
*  Well, when he died, this is very interesting. We went and died then. Camille was there. I lived with him and Camille.
*  And she went out and cleaned the room. And when I saw in the room, I saw all books about psychiatry and the mind and everything and mystic stuff and all that stuff.
*  And I said, this is what he was really about. Yeah, he just like he believed in mystic believer as well.
*  He believed in Zen and the art of archery and all that. He had those books. He was just a believer in more than what we saw.
*  You know, it was more than what we could physically articulate going on with us as human beings or what we are called.
*  When you sit back and you think about your career and how fortunate you were to run into that guy, I mean, how much did that play a part in your mind?
*  Like when you knocked out Trevor Burbank, became the youngest ever heavyweight champion. When you think about that, did you ever stop and think like, man, how lucky am I that I ran into that man?
*  No, no. He said he summons me.
*  He summoned you. Whoa.
*  Makes sense. I mean, you think about a man whose life work involved psychiatry, involved the mind, boxing, hypnosis, training all these boxers.
*  Floyd Patterson had all these great fighters. And then he wants one great one before it's over.
*  No, he wants an animal.
*  An animal.
*  An animal. He summoned you.
*  What did that feel like for you? Did it make sense?
*  No, I believe what he told me.
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I believe you could summon someone, but goddamn, that seems like it's real.
*  Yeah.
*  That seems like it's real.
*  I don't know. I think you can do whatever you believe you can do if you really believe it.
*  Yeah. Well, that was what I got out of all the things that I read about you and him together and being able to talk to you about you and him, is that he gave you these tools to understand the way your mind worked and you just ran with them.
*  I'm an extreme kind of person. Yeah. So I get carried away. If your confidence is not a delusional perspective, you have to write confidence.
*  Yeah. You get so amped up, Mike. Even sitting here talking to you about these things, I could see it in you. You get amped up even just talking about achieving things, talking about success, talking about the mind. I could see it inside of you. You get very fired up about these things.
*  Yeah. I have to be serious about anything that I want to accomplish.
*  Yeah, that intensity is what made you special. I mean, that...
*  I mean, Joe, I can't have people... This is the first time I had my wife and kids around me. Normally this can't happen. I have to be away from them.
*  For camp. Yeah. Yeah. No, I can tell, man. You're different right now than the last time I saw you. I could tell you're ramping up for this fight.
*  Yeah, it's just what it is. I don't know if I like being who I am. It's just who I am.
*  Are you planning on doing this and then seeing whether or not you're cool with it after it's over? And then maybe going back to the way you were?
*  I just want to do it. You just want to do it? Yeah, let's just do it. Only think about that for now and then let all the chips fall where they may after it's over?
*  I just do it. I just want to do it. I like doing it. I don't think it's going to be disastrous enough that this is going to be awesome and we're going to do it.
*  I'm so glad you're doing it, man. There's a lot of people that had negative opinions about it and I was like, listen.
*  No, this is interesting. Okay. Just think about it. How old are you? You're not that old. I'm 53. I'm a year younger than you.
*  Yeah, but listen, the fact is like when they said they can't get people on the moon because they didn't want to believe it.
*  Because it's like they don't want to believe it. What they're going to say what happens.
*  I think there's a difference in today than there was in 20 years ago when you were dealing with a 54 year old person when you're talking about recovery, when sports science, what they know about how to make the body work, what they know about training and conditioning.
*  People are just different now. Yeah, but it also have to do. You could be in so many steroids and pills or whatever they got health growth and all that stuff.
*  But listen, you could be the best physical shape. Me. Right. If you don't go out there with a good mental perspective is going to turn out disastrous. Yeah. If you're not mentally prepared, it's going to be disastrous.
*  But that's the thing that I'm liking about talking to you. You seem very mentally prepared. You're ramped up, Mike.
*  Yeah, I don't know if I am. It's just that this is who I am. I guess I don't know. I like fighting.
*  Well, that's why you were so fucking great at it. And that's what's so exciting about this is that you're back into that mindset again.
*  I guess so. Yeah, I try to control it because I have to know I have people at home. I have to level my personality down for.
*  That's the problem, right? The problem is living a regular life. Yeah.
*  Turn once you turn the switch on and just to keep you know, normally when I'm in this mode, I only want a slave. I don't want a family member.
*  I had to cut stuff down to be able to be from a humanity perspective. You get into the conqueror's mindset.
*  It's just that I think everything should go my way while I'm going through this process. Yeah.
*  I think no should be a foreign language for this next two months for what I need to prepare for what I need to prepare for.
*  Everything should go your way. Yeah, from my perspective, for me knowing me preparing for what I need to prepare for.
*  That's an alien thought process for most people. They don't understand like to be Mike Tyson, to be who you were when you were at the top. You have to think like that.
*  I don't know. I think everyone thinks like that. You think like that too. I think the fight is the most extreme version of that though.
*  For you to prepare for the for you to say who you were going to just say you had Joe Biden and for you to prepare for that.
*  That's going to be very interesting, right? You're not going to come at him like you came out from that you know what you're comfortable with.
*  You're going to look at it from a different perspective. Let me hit him from this part and see what's going on.
*  Because he's going to look at you as just some small sports jock. Yeah.
*  So you're going to say I'm going to surprise him and come at him from this direction. That's just how we think the competitive.
*  We don't want nobody to think what we are. We want them to have a little bit of figuring out process of what we are.
*  If I had Joe Biden in here, I think I'd get really high before I talk to him.
*  Oh, that would be beautiful. I think he would be high too.
*  He can't tell me he's not a high guy. He looks like he's a high guy. He's going to be a high head.
*  It definitely seems like he's on something. Yeah, but I would get really high before I talk to a dude like that.
*  That would be awesome. You know how sometimes when you're real high you can feel energy from people, good or bad? You feel.
*  You know what I mean? If you're hunting mushrooms, you got them pegged. Whoa, baby!
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you're hunting mushrooms, you see who they really are behind the screen.
*  If my wife don't like me, she's no mushroom. She says, you're on shrooms again, huh? Don't come in here with no damn shrooms.
*  Shrooms and DMT. Don't mess with shrooms and...what's that? Chunga. Don't mess with no Chunga and shrooms.
*  That's a no-no for me at the house. Don't bring that shit home.
*  Yeah, that's funny, man. Yeah. Just even microdosing. If you microdose mushrooms and you're around people, especially if someone's lying to you,
*  especially if they're pretending or something they're not.
*  Listen, I've done mushrooms alone. Before I used to do like a bag. And then when I stopped for like three months, I said, let me just do a little.
*  I'm looking at the television and BANG!
*  I'm God and you guys are just here for my entertainment.
*  They just watch the television. First it's cool and then it starts sounding, whoa, it sounds good. And then BOOM! It hits you.
*  I know some dudes who train on it. They like to train on mushrooms.
*  Listen, all I did, I took some mushrooms and I did the bike for two hours. But it was like, it was just like I was in a zone but breathing heavy.
*  I was in a zone where I could hear my breathing and I was like, what the? I'm going to die. I'm thinking you're going to die. Holy shit.
*  I don't stop real, I'm thinking I'm dead. Because that's what mushrooms do, it makes you believe you're dead. It gives you that feeling of fucking like BOOM!
*  It's just, I'm living dead.
*  It's feeling that your soul is separate from your physical body.
*  Listen, why can't they, listen, stop. It's like, no, it's like you're in this room, right? I'm in this room.
*  And why you say that blew my mind? I'm in the room and all the room is like, it could be like, the whole room, this whole room is like covered in like a kind of like shaded, visible.
*  And I'm just covered in the whole, and it's just me and everything, the whole world is outside of me.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like I'm gone and everything is just my entertainment. I'm just looking in and no one sees me. And I'm like, it's just, oh man, forget it.
*  I got to run with this, hey baby, baby, baby, even though I've been hiding this stuff from her. Baby, baby, I took some shrooms, I'm not feeling good baby. I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling good. I'm seeing shit, I'm not feeling good.
*  What does your wife say when you do that?
*  She says, I told you not to use that shit. Stop doing it.
*  I learned things when I do them though too. I learned things about myself.
*  Absolutely. Oh, do I?
*  Yeah.
*  And I said, see baby, because when I do learn, I tell my wife, she said, this is true. I said, see, the shrooms, the shrooms, it gives me that enlightenment.
*  But it's also, once I do shrooms, I know why I have to stop doing the shrooms, because I start doing it too much, and then I lose concept of time.
*  Mmm.
*  I might have been, like you say, me and my wife in the car, we drop off the kid to a class that she goes once every week. We drop her off, then we come back to the house, and I just say, hey, where's Milan?
*  We just dropped off Mike, and I lost that concept, I lost that time.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it makes regular life seem like trivial. So things like time, they don't, it doesn't mean anything anymore. It's a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  If you have to keep appointments.
*  Oh no, I'm not going to make that.
*  And if you go there, and if your body, the shrooms tell you, hey, you shouldn't really be here, this is not worth our time, this is not what we're, this is not what we're vibing on to reach the higher level, this becomes disastrous.
*  This guy becomes the enemy now. He's stopping my enlightenment now.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shrooms, it's, I think it should, I think they should be clinics.
*  Some of them do. They are, cybertenant, supercybin.
*  Psilocybin.
*  Psilocybin, yeah.
*  It's still a schedule one drug, unfortunately, in this country, but I think there should be clinics where the professionals are talking through.
*  Listen, have you heard about the white cobra?
*  The white cobra?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, he should be a great psychedelic too.
*  It's another psychedelic?
*  No, the lizard tail, the centipede.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  The toe, of course you know the toe, the short pea, what else?
*  The jellyfish, I believe is one, and they have, they have quite a few animals that possess that.
*  Psychedelic chemicals?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we're being fucked in this country because they keep that shit from us and they make it illegal.
*  And so many people have learned great things about themselves through mushrooms and through all kinds of different psychedelics, especially micro dosing.
*  They learned how to stop us from drinking.
*  They gave us a rule to stop us from drinking by taking shrooms and LSD and stuff.
*  Yeah, stops people from smoking cigarettes.
*  I just think we abused them.
*  I think they've been using them since the beginning of time, and we, people like us, we abused them.
*  Yeah, but people abuse everything.
*  They abuse cheeseburgers and alcohol.
*  You should be able to take whatever you want as a grown man.
*  And the fact that this country keeps it from us and keeps it illegal, it's fucked up because it could benefit so many people.
*  I think we would have a better society.
*  Well, it would benefit the people that they wanted to benefit.
*  The people who are hiding from us are the ones that are getting benefit.
*  I think the people that are hiding from us, they're protected pharmaceutical companies.
*  Well, listen, I don't know who they are, but I know there's somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, well, there's a lot of factors.
*  There's a lot of factors, but for me personally and for a lot of people that I know, they've gained great benefits from psychedelics.
*  When you think about this world we live in, what do you think about?
*  How do they ever exist?
*  What is the origin of it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, the world is a strange place and stranger right now because of COVID and because everyone's locked down.
*  Society's kind of fucked up.
*  I just think we as human beings, what we are, whatever we exist to be, we're fucking germs and we're the cause of everything that happens to us.
*  I just always think that people let out the virus.
*  We're viruses.
*  We're fungus.
*  That's what we are, fungus.
*  If we look at it from the perspective of consciousness, what do we do?
*  We get sick, we get other people sick, and we die.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever heard of Terrence McKenna?
*  You know who Terrence McKenna is?
*  No, tell me about Terrence.
*  Terrence McKenna was a brilliant ethnobotanist.
*  He was a guy that worked with plants and he was into psychedelics and he had a theory called the stoned ape theory.
*  And he believed that human beings became human beings because of psychedelics.
*  He thinks that we developed into human beings when lower hominids like ancient man was experimenting with mushrooms.
*  That could be interesting.
*  So I think, well, let me not think that.
*  Let me tell you, I saw documentaries.
*  And from the documentary, it appears to be that the world was created off of drugs.
*  Someone's taking some drugs and they're reaching that belief to be designed and dimensioned from God.
*  And this is how the world was discovered.
*  If you ever do some research in the history of drugs.
*  Yeah, I've definitely done some research in the history of drugs.
*  Oh, so I'm sure you understand.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, drugs in human beings, for sure, it accelerates creativity, right?
*  It gives people ideas.
*  But the idea behind psilocybin is a bunch of ideas.
*  One of them is that it actually can make people think about things like language and that language could have come about from people making these connections from psilocybin.
*  It also makes people a little bit more creative, makes people horny, increases visual acuity.
*  Make them compassionate.
*  Make them compassionate, would bond them in terms of community.
*  It also is better for them.
*  And love.
*  They have the love component as well.
*  And if you think about it for long periods of time, if that became a part of the human diet, it would make sense that that was one of the things that made people better.
*  No, it wouldn't make sense because the diet has always been abused.
*  Our diet is being abused now because that's why we have to obese.
*  Sure, now.
*  And that's what happens with all these extreme drugs and alternative drugs.
*  We abuse them.
*  We take them too much.
*  We smoke too much weed.
*  You know, we smoke too much weed.
*  We smoke too many cigarettes.
*  We have to do too much of everything.
*  Yeah, we do abuse shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you think that is?
*  Why do you think people do?
*  Do you think?
*  But don't you think that that same abuse, that same, like, that's also what makes people great at things too?
*  Because that same, almost the same mindset that allows someone to abuse drugs or abuse gambling and become obsessed with pornography also is the same mindset, if channeled the right way, that allows someone to become obsessed with boxing.
*  What prevents them from doing the right thing from the wrong thing with the same feeling?
*  What prevents that?
*  Emotional intelligence.
*  Yes.
*  The majority of the world doesn't even possess that.
*  The world is not even 50 years old.
*  Right.
*  So this is going to be a struggle for the next 100 years.
*  That's going to be until we get that.
*  That's going to have to be our main objective to develop that in order to succeed as human beings.
*  Yeah, that's no truer words have ever been said.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's emotional intelligence.
*  Because listen, our feelings are enslaved by our emotions and our emotions are enslaved by our feelings.
*  And sometimes we sort of placate those emotions by drowning it in food or in booze or in gambling or sex or anything that can distract you.
*  And then we turn that into memories.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we become enslaved to our memories and it never stops.
*  Right.
*  That's who we are.
*  We are an alcohol, we are a gambling addict.
*  We allowed ourselves to become that.
*  Yes.
*  We can stop from coming at just like we learned alcohol is anonymous.
*  Yeah.
*  So we can learn from that.
*  So that's why they learn from that so now it's not hopeless anymore.
*  Right.
*  That's why it's so hard for people because they have a memory of all the things they've done that's wrong and they do it all the time and that becomes who they think they are.
*  So they start changing the picture.
*  Right.
*  It's all about changing the channel, you know?
*  Right.
*  Change that channel in life.
*  Well, that's what's so exciting about you with this new chapter of your life.
*  You've just completely changed who you are.
*  You went from pot smoking Mike Tyson who's running Tyson Ranch who's this real nice guy to hang around with, doing hot boxing with Mike Tyson, fun to be with, everything's great and all of a sudden you shift right back into Mike Tyson the murderer again.
*  Well, it's just that as I said earlier today, if we knew who we were we'd be very limited.
*  You know, we don't know who we are.
*  We don't know.
*  You don't know what you might do tomorrow when you wake up.
*  It's true.
*  You might.
*  Are you married?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, listen, you might get married again.
*  You might go crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Might take on a new job.
*  You never know.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's one of the exciting things about life, right?
*  I mean, this has to be an exciting time for you to make this big switch.
*  Yeah, I think about that too.
*  I think about a lot.
*  I think about a lot like, you know, I'm 54 and that I'm not going to be here much longer than when I go.
*  I'm going to be able to see my wife and kids again.
*  Friends that I've loved all my life.
*  I'm never going to see them again.
*  I start thinking about that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you know, when we think about it, this guy's book, what does it say?
*  Every one beat away from our internal journey.
*  Some guy sent me that book and I said, wow, this is pretty cool because it's true.
*  We're only one heartbeat away from dying and going on that long ride of not knowing or feeling.
*  Because that's when I was on the toad.
*  DMT is all about feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  The feel makes the reality.
*  How much did that change your perspective on life when you had those experiences?
*  It got me in shape.
*  It got me this.
*  This is what it had me do.
*  The first time I did it, it just blew my mind.
*  Then I did it again and said, hey, you better get in shape.
*  Let's get in shape.
*  What the fuck's wrong with you?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm listening.
*  That's what I did.
*  I like it.
*  I told you.
*  Hey, you're fucking up.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially when you think about it.
*  See, I'm not the guy.
*  You have to say, hey, Mike, man, you know, you gained a few pounds.
*  Let's kind of work it out, man.
*  You can do it.
*  You big fat dog.
*  Get your shit together.
*  You big fat mother.
*  You're a fat, lazy motherfucker.
*  That motivates me.
*  You need to hear that.
*  And you need to tell it to yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  No, anybody, the right person needs to tell it to me too.
*  Who the fuck's going to say that to you?
*  They do.
*  Hey, hey, hey.
*  I was, I listened.
*  I was, I was at somewhere around Freddie.
*  I went somewhere to do something.
*  Then I saw one of Freddie Roach's trainers.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  I saw a guy.
*  He was an Irish guy.
*  European guy.
*  And he knew me for years.
*  Cause I used to work with He said, what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  Look at you, man.
*  This is not fucking right.
*  Look at.
*  Oh my.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  And wow, I felt this big button.
*  He's been around a bunch of people, but he said, you know this is not right.
*  This is not right.
*  For me, that's a fuck.
*  Right.
*  And, um, I got right.
*  Yeah.
*  Some people call that fat shaming.
*  But I think fat shaming works for me works for me too if I got fat I would want somebody to yell at me
*  And I found out he that's and he thought that I was a fat motherfucking. He wouldn't tell me I wouldn't be his friend
*  I wouldn't be cool with him no more if he's not telling me your mic man. It's not right man
*  At least let me know I might not want to do but let me know yeah, I'm not looking good shit ain't right
*  Yeah, you know cuz the guy ain't gonna tell you he's hanging around let you stay eating and fucking hanging around drinking
*  Yes, that's the enemy man. Yeah, that's the enemy so
*  You do the DMT trip, and then you have it in your head like I gotta get in shape
*  Absolutely absolutely like sometimes you say they body shaming doesn't hurt people hurt some people to me
*  It makes me hey man. Let me it helps me. That's the commonest that guy
*  The only way it hurts people is if you don't listen
*  Yeah, someone says you're fat and then it hurts your feelings, but you don't work out then it hurts you
*  But if someone says you're fat and it hurts your feelings you say I'm gonna use this as a motivator
*  You're not gonna shake that then it helps you exactly fat shaming is only bad if you don't stop
*  Yeah, I never looked at it fat shaming. Yeah, that's what you said like who's gonna say to Mike like I don't respect that guy yeah
*  The guy that things like that. I'm not gonna tell him. Oh, I'm that's my enemy right. He's not helping you
*  He's my enemy right right. He's my enemy so my enemy the DMT trip open your eyes to that yeah absolutely
*  Yeah
*  But that's not something you want to do on your camp. You know I did it 16 times
*  17 16 times yeah never regret doing it
*  I think everybody should do it. It's just not everybody
*  But everybody wants to get for everybody not everybody everybody who needs it should do it. I should say that
*  Yeah, because some people believe this is all this is the real world. Yeah, they really believe this is the reality
*  Isn't that interesting like once you do it you realize that that world is somewhere vivid than this world and
*  We're gonna be in that world longer than we're gonna be in this world
*  Yeah, that's probably true, I don't know what it is, but it's probably true, but this will listen
*  This is what happened you do this toast off any of those um
*  interesting
*  narcotics
*  You have a different opinion about dying and the fear of dying yeah, you know you see you start to think hey
*  Maybe I'm living too long
*  You know shit well, maybe that's just another existence
*  That's that's what what made me think like maybe this is always there and maybe this life that we have that with this temporary life
*  That we're clinging on to that's so important
*  Why nobody wants to really stick on to the fact that after we die is over why nobody want to hold on to that
*  Yeah, then saying well, it's that more is then really being confident with saying hey
*  There's something else after this and that's from scaring us from dying the early or what you know
*  Why do people stick with that that's a smooth is that the soften our ride to the internal life of darkness or what it might?
*  Be I mean we don't know until we die right yeah
*  But everybody think the people that think that it's just over when you die it's over you know the world
*  Darkness and then that's it that might be right
*  Or it might be that you go to that place where you go when you smoke DMT. It might be that
*  That might be you don't remember when you were born do you you don't you're not gonna remember when you died
*  Yeah, I think we're born again if we're born again. We're not gonna remember the life. We had no gonna remember this shit
*  Oh, I've always said everybody's scared to die, but no one's scared to sleep
*  You know see this way some people are yeah, some people are afraid to sleep
*  You know they get their moments with some time you think way
*  I might not wake up this morning
*  Could you hear and you know people at your school sleep having a nice time with you then do any drugs and they start and wake up
*  That's true, too
*  But the thing about sleep is you're pretty confident. You're gonna come back, so you're willing to shut off
*  It's okay, but no one wants to shut off forever, but listen the belief that you're gonna come back is magnificent
*  Yeah, please to know that we're gonna wake up in the morning. I just we went into life like that yeah with that belief
*  Yeah
*  And you think life is just temporary and
*  That when it's over you're gonna go to an even more magnificent place
*  We say life what life when we that's not life is not over right when we leave this place right?
*  It's another form of life. We haven't experienced yet right even if it's the black life
*  Where it's just all darkness is a part of life that we have to embrace in some kind of form of fashion
*  Well, that's the weird thing about the toad right is that there's no visions, but the but the feeling so intense you see
*  Yeah, right feeling so intense even makeup or whatever you see it from that's what feeling is so important
*  We just don't even understand the
*  Feeling the I we don't understand they even lie to us right I just lied to us I
*  Remember the first thing I felt is so insignificant
*  Like you're just a part of everything you're part of the whole universe and instead of looking at yourself as a center of the universe
*  When I did it I just made me realize like no you're part of this infinite thing and it's such a small part
*  Everyone is such a small part
*  The universe itself is what's big and you're just a piece of it. We're all just feeding each other
*  Yeah, we're all just feeding each other blood to just run into each other feet to the holes of dirt the mud everything the water
*  The ocean the air we just all feed in each other. Yeah, the bugs. There's more listen. Um
*  There's more stars in it in the space than there are grains of sand in the desert yeah, I did that it's ridiculous
*  What do you think about aliens Mike I think we're aliens you think so I think with descendants of aliens
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the only thing I could come if you can't explain if you can only tell me about Adam and Eve
*  I'm gonna go with the aliens
*  Hmm, if that's what you hit me with Adam and Eve. Yeah, I'm gonna go with these alien guys
*  Well, there's a lot of people that believe that we're the product of aliens that aliens came down and did some experience
*  Experiments with lower hominids and did some accelerated genetic experiments and created people well listen
*  Aliens of this and when
*  when certain tribes the people I'm not saying not cut on
*  Caucasian when it came to Africa even before that when people came to other people the first time they seen them they were aliens
*  yeah, first time I'm
*  Asian man for Caucasian man. I was an alien a black man for Asian men a white man. I was an alien. Yep
*  Maybe they weren't aliens but that what they thought they were do is a tribe of people that encountered them and
*  Perhaps they were getting extinct they were dying and they had to
*  Read through just the lower whatever you were saying lower hominids
*  Oh and hominids and maybe that this is us because they had certain um, as you may know
*  I know, you know, you do these kind of researchers
*  They already discovered there was um, there were different forms of species that that's working down to us that they came from us
*  And now we're at the degree of I guess we're the human species of our yeah
*  There was a bunch of different kinds of humans. Yeah. Yeah, there was many many different kinds of humans and before they were here
*  million of the years
*  before millions of years
*  After we were erectus
*  After we walk they always been here it's very rare that you can find a
*  Human life that didn't wasn't erectus they could find a skeleton of one that walked in all fours. Mm-hmm
*  the oldest person they found is
*  Four million four point four million years old Lucy. I believe it is
*  Four point four million years old is nothing
*  It's nothing in terms of people were erected then he were walking on both feet then
*  Yeah, you know for me for years
*  Four million years ago, so they never found I don't believe they ever found the
*  Skeleton of a human that wasn't erectus. That's one of the things about life is that life is so short
*  Twinkle of an eye everything goes well you live a hundred years
*  But that is nothing in terms of the the life of the planet
*  You know how long it took them to build the Great Wall of China thousands of years to build two thousand years
*  Yeah
*  Two thousand years. Yeah
*  Can you imagine that and that's nothing?
*  Two thousand years is
*  Less than what crisis been around crisis young young crisis
*  Terms of the world. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Now that's how bad they wanted to keep the Mongols out. They built the fucking wall took them thousands of years
*  You ever read about Genghis Khan?
*  Listen, um
*  His real name is Timogen. Yeah, and he um
*  Let me tell you what happened. He's like 13 when he died around 13 what 14. Oh, he
*  he's real rain was like in the 12th and early 1300s and
*  First of all, he came from he's a real poor mother father
*  They all came they got beat up and took out he had a woman then they took his wife
*  But he got friendly with a real bad mother a real
*  He was a criminal but he was the baddest of all he was so bad and he loved
*  Timogen he just became you know, I some guys you see a guy and they hit it off one guy
*  He was really weak at the time and this other gang had took his wife and
*  He and the feminist guy was making a lot of them raid and stuff and he was just sad
*  What is wrong? The guy really loved him. He said what is wrong? He said these people took my wife
*  He said don't worry. I got many a way. What are you worried about that one way?
*  I really loved her cuz he really loved her and so the guy said listen
*  I'm gonna help you get your wife back, but you ever tell nobody that we raided this city because of a woman
*  Okay, and so he went back and the guy got his wife back and so the guy allowed
*  Timogen to be number two because he loved him so much
*  But he got jealous because the men started
*  Saving the gang is because gingers will let them raid everything said keep it all
*  He wouldn't take nothing. Keep it all let the men have it all and they all started
*  Looking up to my father and then the other guy got jealous and eventually gingers had to kill him
*  But he said he wanted gingers didn't want to do but he said you have to kill me and so gingers kill him
*  But you want to go when he said I'm you're not gonna spill any blood so he crushed them in the rocks
*  They want big no blood no cuts and nothing like that
*  But that was his best friend and after he died, that's how gingers had the reputation
*  So you followed them you pay attention to him. You you read a bunch of shit
*  I named my dog after his favorite wife Paley. Oh
*  So I know you've been into that kind of shit like Alexander the great yeah all the all the
*  Pippin
*  chalamane
*  Clovis
*  Now is this stuff that you just studied because you wanted to study conquerors. They just interest you I
*  Wanted to study that mindset
*  You know, I found that the greatest conquerors
*  They ever lived on
*  The farmers
*  You know farmers sheep herders
*  Somebody that we weren't think that's important and stuff and then as they became great through that
*  They may be birthed to great children who were born with greatness like Alexander the great and stuff like Philip the Macedonian
*  That whole bloodline of Alexander they were all kings, but they were very small and insignificant
*  until
*  It was always one Alexander before him that was pretty great and forgives the Persians
*  But eventually they lost and they pretty much kissed the Persians ass, you know
*  I mean persons put them in the position of power until
*  Philip of Philip Macedonia came who had the nickname aka Philip the barbarian
*  And he wanted to go across and enslave all the Persians and everybody after that the world and Alexander the great
*  Mother who was a really interesting woman
*  I'm trying to say Albanian maybe and they had a different kind of
*  Study and worship and stuff back then so he got caught up in that his family didn't like her for that. But um, she arranged for
*  She arranged for Alexander's father, I think to be killed for Alexander to have the power to her kick
*  That's the power she can lead to her kids while he was on campaigns
*  right and
*  When he was on these campaigns now that his father was going he just
*  Conquered everything but when he ran into the Afghani and people he fell in love with them
*  He wanted to interbreed with him. He wanted to create a new race of Afghani
*  He is madly fell in love with him and that's pretty much why his his family is not the same but the Greeks
*  went
*  What they went mountain mutiny on him because they were jealous that they were given big positions to the bomb
*  The Persians and the Afghanistan he loved me even quote the Afghanis and the most beautiful people the world
*  God must have loved them more than anybody. He made them beautiful. He really fell in love with them
*  When did you start getting really into like conquerors when you start 15 15?
*  What introduced you to it?
*  I was at the table eat with custom a friend of mine named Craig was said a statement which he was wrong
*  But it sounds really good to make me investigate
*  He said Alexander the great at his time was like six five, so at six five three hundred years before Christ
*  That was a giant which was wrong. He was very small
*  The army was too big for me. It's really small guy. Mm-hmm. It wasn't big at all
*  And so just that alone him saying that got you interested
*  Yeah, I want to do with the monster the massive guy, but not something he's just a small man average guy
*  You know, he's not a Mac monster at all a big man at all
*  But you got interested in the the mindset of the conquerors. Yeah, well, listen, this is what I want to know
*  Why would one person think that he could fuck it on the whole world one person why would he have that mind who would think like that?
*  Why would a man person why would that's not a fucking person? That's just something
*  When your ego just got so out of whack where you just can't think rational
*  How do you think like that and you're a nice person?
*  It was a guy before him a couple hundred years before him names Cyrus the great
*  He was just like he was a conqueror, but he was a conqueror for Liberty
*  He wanted to conquer all the slaves and let them go conquer all the slave masters. Let them go
*  He got killed for that too, but maybe that sounds that sounds cool to right? That's good
*  That's a good thing
*  But listen think about it who the fuck is he to take somebody else's property take somebody else's stuff because he believed it's wrong
*  Which it probably is wrong. I think it's wrong. But who the fuck is he?
*  Who is this guy to take other just to conquer you? You don't bother nobody, but this is what they did back there
*  Now you're killing everybody back then. It was really legal. It's almost in the Bible than the books
*  It's not I won't say but it's in books slavery is in the books in the religious book that we need slaves and he did
*  This was and this guy's gonna say hey no more slaves
*  He's 500 BC. So he's gonna say no more slaves
*  No more slavery is wrong out through the whole world. So he wants to conquer the world and free of slaves
*  Wow, so that's just a different mindset. Yeah, they're different kinds of mindsets. Yes conquerors had
*  Who do you think he is? Who the hell is he?
*  He has this little town over here high go over the whole world his town is right here
*  Well, forget his town his country is right here. Yeah, you know
*  And he don't even he didn't even conquer this country and now he's gonna conquer the world and liberate freedom make freedom
*  What kind of now that's nothing if that's not somebody on drugs, you know, you tell me no you tell me now be honest
*  That's not somebody high you tell me it could be coke. No
*  It's
*  I'm afraid everybody right this is the one of 500 BC. This is slavery is what it is. This is the way of the world
*  No, I'm gonna free all the slaves
*  It's pretty crazy
*  Everybody what did you get out of like reading about their mindset like studying Temujin studying?
*  Alexander the Great like what did you get out of reading there about their mindsets? Um, I
*  Found out that the greatest ones the best the most
*  politic ones
*  Were all mama's boys really yeah, it's greater than mother Wow
*  Napoleon Alexander
*  You know me Wow
*  Genghis Khan too. Yeah, really? Yeah
*  What do you think that is, huh, what do you think that's all about highly respect their mother
*  I'm thinking there. I think their mothers were the first especially Alexander the Great
*  I think she was the first stage mother. I think there was some before her too. Mm-hmm, you know, cuz
*  Cleopatra was what that's just what the word at the end of the day
*  They were wanted to lead through their sons or daughters or something like that
*  Like that parent that takes their kids to athletic events and screams and cheers and pumps them up and no
*  No, it's the parent who?
*  whose child
*  Word is law and I want to be able to have that word
*  Okay, you get that? Yeah, my son is the king, right?
*  I want to be able to have that word
*  I want to be able to have that word
*  Word
*  Mmm, okay, you get that? Yeah, my son is the king, right?
*  There's country a couple of countries, but I want I want I want my thought to be in his mind
*  Come out of his mouth. Do you think the parents convinced the child that they were that special that they should run the world?
*  Some of them do but as some kids get older like Ivan the great I've been the terrible they get older and then they realize
*  These people weren't right to me and I and they start killing his
*  Sponsor to the people that would rep his step parents and stuff
*  You know some of the kings did it too, you know
*  So when when you were studying this when you were coming up as a boxer and you're studying all these conquerors
*  You were trying to understand their mindsets. Yeah, and you were trying to apply that to your own life
*  Pretty much. Yeah. Did you get anything out of it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  What did you get? Like what how did it apply to your own life? Well at the end of the day to all X God for forgiveness
*  mmm all of them
*  So when you're reading all these books about all these conquerors when you're a young man and you're on your way to becoming the youngest
*  ever heavyweight champion and
*  You you're trying to take on the mindset of the conquerors and you find out they all ask God for forgiveness. Yes
*  How did that affect you?
*  That was pretty cool
*  because by that I
*  Learned greatness with the willingness to die
*  By you know doing research on these particular individuals
*  And that's what they were willing to do for greatness
*  Mmm and you you know, you heard about Achilles and stuff easy. He what did he want a short life of?
*  Greatness than a long life of obscurity. Yeah, he took the short life and that's what Alexander did
*  When you when you study these people and you
*  You take that conquerors mind set
*  Did you get anything out of that? Did you apply that into your own your own?
*  Pursuit as a champion. Absolutely because you have listen Alexander the great was 32 and he conquered the known world
*  Yeah in ten years
*  And so thinking about that as a young man absolutely I want to I
*  Want my preeminence to vibe all the time that you know, when you're a young man
*  It's the vibe of the time that you know in the sands of time. It's not rain with it
*  I don't think everybody should want that that are competitive in the art of
*  What do you say?
*  Immortality. Yeah, and I search for it. That's what he wanted. He wanted he wanted immortality. That's what he wanted
*  He wanted to be known since they know till the end of time
*  Did you ever think that maybe you were born in the wrong time that maybe if you were born in the times of Alexander the great?
*  You would also be a conqueror. No, I am a conqueror now because I've conquered myself and my demons
*  You know not because I'm at that time I'm never born to I'm born in the right time
*  Most of them couldn't conquer their demons
*  that's why they ask for forgiveness from God all of them because just like
*  The gentleman um that discovered them
*  Um
*  I'll call it anonymous, you know
*  He um, he inspired maybe he could maybe he had a problem without call that then but he how many people have be inspired?
*  Yeah, that is so much bigger than him succeeding and not with his problem
*  You know what's interesting about him is he was interested in LSD. They will see yeah. Yeah
*  That was a big thing of his that's what that's what instructed him to have the program. Yeah, develop the program. Yeah
*  When you're talking about they all
*  Would seek forgiveness from God
*  That's it's so interesting to me that you turned to cannabis and cannabis will allowed you to forgive yourself
*  Yeah, I'm listen the reason why they ask for forgiveness for God
*  This is why this is interesting that you said that it's because they believe they were God and they have had that the end of the day
*  Realizing check themselves, but they're not yeah, they're not God and then they've done horrific things
*  Yeah at the end of his life he was so forgiving and giving everything away and so sorry for everybody
*  He didn't know how to forgive himself either. He didn't know how do you do that when you think you go?
*  How do you forgive yourself? So at the end of the day, he said look the man who conquered the world
*  Died with nothing in his hand. He gave everything away had no swords or nothing
*  He was so freaked out about dying being the rich guy and stuff and having so much property and having the world like he
*  Possessed because he had the world
*  This gentleman that he well Eugenius Scott the guy that they named sloth after
*  then was sloth
*  Eugenius I don't know but he was like he's considered a homeless bum
*  Nowadays today would be called a bum a homeless guy whatever and Alexander been watching him. This is how keen he is
*  He's watched this guy for years and he said listen before he became king of Greece. He's watched this guy
*  This is when he wasn't killed and he said hey listen
*  I
*  Watch you and I have everything and I'm unhappy and you don't have nothing
*  So what do you what can I do to you to make you happy?
*  You know what he said nobody had the balls to say
*  he said first of all, you can be kind enough to move out the way of the Sun and
*  then allowed me to enjoy my day and
*  He couldn't conceive somebody they turned him down for riches and stuff. He couldn't conceive of it. It just blew his mind
*  He was so blown away. He couldn't even kill a guy for disrespecting them
*  He was just blown away. He said this I have everything and I didn't realize he wasn't happy
*  He had it all he's the king of Greece. He doesn't even know where he was getting ready to go
*  He's gonna be king of the world, but he's king of Greece and he's just not happy and he has everything
*  So he thinks by conquering the world is gonna make him happy and he did and he what happened
*  He turned into a drug Wow
*  Imagine that it's crazy he ran that's a he experienced a new drug
*  He listen when um when you went on a campaign know what I thought I thought when you went on a campaign the movies lie
*  They say you go on a campaign to just over 300
*  Gladys or what a ten thousand soldiers know they bring their whole family with them. It's like a party
*  their wives their kids everything they got the
*  surveyors with them
*  House builders are with them the people who deal with them
*  Agriculture for that time everything is with them wine even for the contest everything when they conquer conquering
*  You know what conquering is we think that's glorious conquering is glory in the white cause know why it is conquer is
*  Rob and rape and illegally taking somebody else's goods and enslaving them. That's conquering
*  That's not good people
*  Good people all the people we like we say these guys this guy he conquered this he conquered that they hurt people
*  They did it for greed they didn't do it for we're gonna help our people they did it to take things because they could
*  Now when you were coming up as a fighter and you were reading all these things about conquerors
*  You you were fueling your mind in that way and you were also studying a lot of fights
*  You studied all the old-school
*  Champions are you doing that now in this resurgence like are you studying?
*  No, I think I know everything about them or me. I did the research at them
*  I was a kid so I started reading to that started going to the other leg level
*  So I go from the level of these guys that are fighters the gladiator those guys
*  So I go to from them to the generals and from the generals to the gods
*  And that but that occupied a lot of your time when you were training right absolutely yeah
*  But that what are you doing now?
*  like that there's anything that's similar that you do like when you were watching those old-school tapes if you were watching like
*  Jack Dempsey or
*  Harry Greb or any of these old-school fighters that was there was something about that that was providing you the
*  Inspiration you were you were you were learning from it, but it was also you're getting yourself into this mindset
*  Yeah, because I know if I was like these because we tell you the more you the more you win the more you beat these
*  Guys the more the people applaud and the more you enjoy doing it hmm
*  and I wanted the people wouldn't them people to
*  Have the same feeling towards me that I had towards the older fighters of yesterday yeah
*  So I was madly in love with fighters. I was just my was just and if I met a fighter
*  Hardly, they say who's this kid get this kid out of that we just bug them to death
*  Let me carry a bag and help you this guy do this it's fucking you know you think they were gonna like you for being
*  The world hey get this fucking kid away
*  Yeah, yeah carry a bag can help you
*  But you're not you don't study films like that anymore now. Yeah, yeah, you know what I do
*  Sometimes look at that YouTube. I look at YouTube and they have fight limit shanko. I said let me check him out
*  Yeah, I also make see some Ray Robbins and Willie pep stuff. Yeah, I'm gonna check this out
*  Little machin goes a wild guy to watch isn't he he's really?
*  He's really nice to watch he's really interesting right yeah like watching the footwork so extraordinary like doing that
*  I took watching a lot of people hate on them. You know that's how it is
*  You know he got the light yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, who else gets you excited? That's fighting today
*  They got a couple of guys Haney good the guys you knew is good the other little guy from Baltimore's good
*  It's quite a few and they have a couple of guys
*  That's under them. That's pretty good. That's in that that's gonna come up and be really good with them
*  I was Spencer's really good Terrence Crawford Terrence Crawford is good. You know the bunch of good fighters out there
*  That little guy Ryan Garcia, yeah
*  He's got a nasty left hook though
*  And all the fighters not a author and they really into each other's face talking shit
*  They're really friends you can see but they're talking shit. Yeah, I'm saying I'm an insecure
*  I've been a punch right in the face. They might make think I'm a punk letting them do that to me
*  Yeah
*  What do you think of the heavyweight division nowadays? All right, Josh was there's all this and everybody's good for that time
*  I don't think they're bombs anything like that
*  Everybody's I want to have something negative to say about somebody right, you know, this is their time
*  They're the best of their time. You got to give them that credit
*  You can't compete them with guys with the path or guys are coming up now. This is just their time
*  This is what it is right now. Yeah, it is right now. This is time. We're gonna judge it from right here
*  What do you think about it? So it's an interesting group at the very top of the heap right Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder Anthony Joshua
*  It means it's a interesting group at the at the top level right now
*  All exciting fighters, you know, they're all gonna make a great deal of money if they just need to fight each other
*  Yeah, stop bullshitting us all fight each other fight each other a couple of times
*  Yeah, and then when this stuff is over your guys could say hey listen, we did it our way, right?
*  You know, this is what happened to me
*  I'm such an ego maniac. I fell in love. That's my disco. I'm the king forever. I'm always looking this way
*  It is fuck you. I never think about tomorrow nothing. This is now. I'm the king. Let's kiss my fucking ring
*  And the fact that I know this this what I didn't listen to cuz cuz hey
*  Yes, always don't take this person I took fighting personal because they don't take it personal it's not personal
*  I took it personal and the ego make me take it personal
*  So when he said don't take it personal, what did he mean by that?
*  Don't allow it to stop you from living your life in a happy perspective
*  I lost the fight don't commit suicide start drinking a little cocaine
*  Stop fucking girls that you don't know you met him
*  Oh
*  You shake the guy's hand you go to the gym you work harder prepare for the fight you pay you win the fight
*  You don't win the fight you prepare hard away from the next fight
*  You win the fight you don't get the fight fight some other guys you win the fight then fight them again the name of the
*  Game that you stay busy. You keep working how much different with things would have been if costate alive
*  Yes, really different but wasn't meant for that to be yeah
*  Had to refill I had to figure this stuff out he couldn't protect me my whole life right
*  You know, I've always wondered I always wondered what would have been different if he had stayed alive
*  I mean he had he guided you in such an amazing way, you know and you
*  Cuz it was just listen
*  Cuz it was just a hard guy to get along with
*  Cuz was just
*  Enemy prone if he didn't have an enemy he would create one really one of those guys. He loved fighting
*  He wants to fight if he doesn't fight he doesn't want to live
*  Wow wants to fight he needs to have somebody to fight
