# JRE MMA Show #132 with Joaquin Buckley
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6.0s)]
*  Mr. Buckley, how are you, sir? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm doing good, Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to have you in here, man. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, thanks for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=16.0s)]
*  You are the owner of the most highlighted, the most viral video in the history of MMA, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=17.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=23.0s)]
*  That fucking jump, spinning back kick to the face. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=24.0s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=27.0s)]
*  I think so, man. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=28.0s)]
*  It's just for me to actually think that it is, you know what I mean? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=29.0s)]
*  Because there's so many other awesome knockouts out there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=32.0s)]
*  My man, Dan Hendover, Biz B, with the H-bomb. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=34.0s)]
*  And then with my man, S M Barboza with the spinning heel kick on Terry Edam. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=39.0s)]
*  And Francis Ngannou, you know what I'm saying? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=43.0s)]
*  So many different heavy hitters out there with great KOs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=46.0s)]
*  But once I really sat back and looked at it and it took some time to actually take everything in, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that's pretty dope that I did that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=55.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=57.0s)]
*  Because he's holding one foot and you jump spinning back kick him in the face with the other foot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=58.0s)]
*  That is just wild. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=62.0s)]
*  I mean, have you ever done that in a fight before? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=64.0s)]
*  No, so that was my first time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=67.0s)]
*  So if you want to really hear it, man, it's a long story with it because nobody taught me that kick. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=69.0s)]
*  I never had an instructor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=75.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=77.0s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=78.0s)]
*  I was just fascinated with martial arts since I was a little kid. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=79.0s)]
*  Once I got started with MMA and stuff like that, the gym where I came from, it could only teach so much. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=83.0s)]
*  The instructors only knew so much. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=88.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=89.0s)]
*  It was just like a mom and pop gym type stuff where a lot of people would just get there to get into shape. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=90.0s)]
*  But overall, though, when I used to go on YouTube, I used to watch a lot of different videos on how to, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=96.0s)]
*  not just train as a mixed martial artist, but just to learn different moves and techniques from different disciplines. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=103.0s)]
*  From not just taekwondo, but hopkido, kushin, sansho, all these different disciplines that I used to take from. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=108.0s)]
*  And then once I looked at the disciplines, I looked at who the best people in it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=117.0s)]
*  And then I looked at different people in those disciplines, whatever. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=121.0s)]
*  And guess who I ran into when I got into taekwondo? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=125.0s)]
*  I seen one of your videos. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=128.0s)]
*  No, no, for real. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=130.0s)]
*  On George St. Pierre, how to correctly throw the spinning back kick. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=131.0s)]
*  But you at first showed him how to throw the side kick. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=136.0s)]
*  And I used to watch those videos over and over again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=139.0s)]
*  And then it evolved when I seen Raymond Daniels perform the two touch. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=142.0s)]
*  Oh my God, yeah, he did that two touch. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=147.0s)]
*  That's probably one of the biggest highlight reels in kickboxing history. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=149.0s)]
*  Big facts, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=152.0s)]
*  But I seen that, I was like, man, that's dope because it's a level up from what you're showing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=153.0s)]
*  So I used to perform that on the bag, on the heavy bag all the time. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=157.0s)]
*  And people are like, man, what are you doing? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=160.0s)]
*  I used to generate so much power when I used to balance my right foot on her. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=161.0s)]
*  Not my right, but my left foot because I would come in like a roundhouse kick because I'm a softball. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=166.0s)]
*  I would balance on the bag and then I would propel myself off the bag and I would spin. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=170.0s)]
*  And we used to make this hard pop like a shotgun and would bend the entire bag. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=174.0s)]
*  So I'm like, bro, I feel so powerful throwing this kick. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=178.0s)]
*  But regardless though, just seeing these people do this stuff and just learning from them and just imitating these moves years later, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=182.0s)]
*  then I end up performing that kick. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=189.0s)]
*  You know who's got some of the best instructionals of that, of traditional kicks like sidekicks and turning sidekicks? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=190.0s)]
*  Michael Jai White. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm already here. I'm already here. Watch the thousand. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=197.0s)]
*  Michael Jai White has some sharp technique. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, big facts, big facts. And on top of that, even before him, Bill Superfoot Wallace. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=202.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=207.0s)]
*  Come on now. You know what I mean? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=208.0s)]
*  Well, he had the best hook kick ever. His hook kick was incredible. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=209.0s)]
*  Because you know, he only had one knee. His knee was fucked up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, big facts. Yep. And that's why, because he used to do like judo. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=216.0s)]
*  You know, he used to do throws and stuff. He couldn't do it anymore. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=219.0s)]
*  So he ended up transitioning just to kickboxing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=222.0s)]
*  But he taught himself how to just fight on that one side, you know, make himself, you know, just like a line, hard to hit, you know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=224.0s)]
*  But he made his leg like a jab. You know what I mean? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=230.0s)]
*  He was stick guys, but he would hit with a roundhouse, like you said, a heel hook kick, you know what I'm saying? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=234.0s)]
*  Or just like the spinning back kick as well, you know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=239.0s)]
*  See if you can find a highlight of Bill Superfoot Wallace. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=242.0s)]
*  Oh man, he got plenty, man. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=244.0s)]
*  Because the fact that he only used one leg, because he had one knee that was just really fucked up, so he couldn't kick with it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=245.0s)]
*  So because he did everything off that one leg, his one leg had so much dexterity. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=251.0s)]
*  It's like that old school quote from Bruce Lee. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of his instruction videos. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=259.0s)]
*  That's why I used to watch. I used to watch stuff like this all the time, you know. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=261.0s)]
*  And it's cool just coming back to it. And he was so fast too with it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=264.0s)]
*  Like, it was hard to see. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is old school. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=269.0s)]
*  And he would joke around about the camera not being fast enough to see his feet, you know. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=270.0s)]
*  But he had the very best kicks off the front leg. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, man. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=278.0s)]
*  He's still getting after it. Look at him out there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=279.0s)]
*  He's still getting after it. I don't want to try to be funny, but I think my man's still alive. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he is too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=284.0s)]
*  He did commentary in the first UFCs. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=285.0s)]
*  Yes, he did, yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=287.0s)]
*  In the very early days. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=289.0s)]
*  So he's still out there. Look at that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=290.0s)]
*  So this is just a year ago. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=292.0s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=294.0s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=296.0s)]
*  We'll see if he can find some of his fights because he knocked a lot of people out with those. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=297.0s)]
*  Yeah, just try to put like verses in there. It'll pop up on his own. So like, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=300.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=304.0s)]
*  Be a super foot in his verse in his show. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=305.0s)]
*  It was just so hard for people to deal with. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=307.0s)]
*  Oh, that was in a force of one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he fought this guy named Joe Louis. Yeah, yeah, Joe Louis down there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=312.0s)]
*  And Randy Cowell. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=316.0s)]
*  Yeah, right there. Yeah, that's a good one. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=317.0s)]
*  So Joe Louis, not the heavyweight boxer, but the heavyweight kickboxer was a legendary karate fighter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=324.0s)]
*  This is a fun fight to watch. And look at that. Boom! [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=329.0s)]
*  That style with that front leg. The thing about that style, though, I always wondered, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=330.0s)]
*  like, how would those guys do against like a Muay Thai guy through leg kicks? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=334.0s)]
*  Because we saw that with, you know, with a lot of fighters that had that style. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=344.0s)]
*  Once they encountered, like Rick Rufus, once they encountered leg kicks, they got kind of fucked up until they realized how to deal with it and how to use the leg kicks. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=345.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=352.0s)]
*  And then Chris became an incredible leg kicker. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=353.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, perfect example. So Peter Cunningham. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=355.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=358.0s)]
*  So you know who Peter Cunningham is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=359.0s)]
*  Oh, Superfoot. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=360.0s)]
*  Sugarfoot. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=361.0s)]
*  Sugarfoot. Exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=362.0s)]
*  Not Superfoot, Sugarfoot. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=363.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he fought Muay Thai guys and he used to whoop their head. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=364.0s)]
*  Yes, because he could throw leg kicks. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=368.0s)]
*  Yeah, he could throw leg kicks and he had hands. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=370.0s)]
*  Yes, he had everything. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=373.0s)]
*  But that's like the beautiful thing about MMA is we're seeing all those techniques being incorporated. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=374.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=378.0s)]
*  Like you, who can do all the other things. Now you're learning jump spinning back kicks and all this other stuff. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=379.0s)]
*  See, I always assumed watching you fight that you had some sort of a traditional martial arts background because you throw so many side kicks and they're so clean. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=383.0s)]
*  They're so sharp. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=392.0s)]
*  I assumed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=393.0s)]
*  I guess I can attribute that all for martial arts movies. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=394.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=398.0s)]
*  Literally all from martial arts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=399.0s)]
*  People think it's a joke, but literally when I was a kid, just growing up, my mom raised me. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=401.0s)]
*  She was a single mother and stuff like that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=407.0s)]
*  So she only do so much. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=409.0s)]
*  So I was on the TV all the time. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=410.0s)]
*  That's what raised me. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=412.0s)]
*  Just watching the throwing kicks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=413.0s)]
*  Just watching, yeah, big facts. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=414.0s)]
*  Because I was around a lot of women. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=416.0s)]
*  So when she needed help, I was with my godmother, Erica and stuff like that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=418.0s)]
*  And I was with my god sisters and stuff like that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=421.0s)]
*  So there was a lot of women around. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=423.0s)]
*  So I was looking for male influences and the fastest way I could find it was just on TV. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=425.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=429.0s)]
*  So just looking at Bruce Lee, looking at Jackie Chan, looking like Michael Jai White, Donnie Yen, Tony Ja. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=430.0s)]
*  These are the guys I'm like, oh man, I want to be like them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=434.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=437.0s)]
*  It's amazing how many people got influenced to fighting and to traditional martial arts from movies. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=438.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=443.0s)]
*  Some of the greatest kickboxes will tell you who. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=444.0s)]
*  Bruce Lee. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=447.0s)]
*  Bruce Lee is the one that got them into it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=448.0s)]
*  The best salesperson ever is those movies. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=449.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=452.0s)]
*  You look at the emergence of karate academies in the country after Bruce Lee movies. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=453.0s)]
*  Like through the roof. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=458.0s)]
*  Everybody wanted to learn. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=459.0s)]
*  Including Chuck Norris. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=461.0s)]
*  Yes, including Chuck Norris. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=463.0s)]
*  So what was your first actual coaching in martial arts? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=465.0s)]
*  My first coaching, that was the gym at Phinney's MMA. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=470.0s)]
*  And how old were you then? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=473.0s)]
*  I was 18. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=475.0s)]
*  I started as soon as I got out of high school, man, because school wasn't for me at the time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=476.0s)]
*  I was not taking it seriously, but I just always wanted to be a part of martial arts when I was younger. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=480.0s)]
*  And I knew that wrestling was going to be a great foundation to start in. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=486.0s)]
*  So when I was in middle school, got into high school, whatever, I got into wrestling. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=490.0s)]
*  And then after that, after I graduated, went to Phinney's MMA in 2012. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=493.0s)]
*  So when you were wrestling in high school, were you thinking that you were doing this to prepare to fight? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=501.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=503.0s)]
*  Like low-key, but I knew that's what I wanted to do. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=504.0s)]
*  And it was the closest thing to a discipline, to a martial arts discipline, is wrestling. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=506.0s)]
*  That's the only thing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=510.0s)]
*  And probably the most important thing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=511.0s)]
*  I wasn't good at football. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=512.0s)]
*  I wasn't good at basketball. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=513.0s)]
*  I wasn't good at baseball. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=514.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=515.0s)]
*  Couldn't catch water if I fell out of a boat. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=516.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=518.0s)]
*  So my biggest thing was I never really liked sports anyway. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=519.0s)]
*  It's just martial arts. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=522.0s)]
*  And the only thing that I could apply those skills to was wrestling. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=523.0s)]
*  Because my mom didn't want to put me into any karate. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=526.0s)]
*  Oh, that still costs money at the end of the day. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=528.0s)]
*  But wrestling was free. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=530.0s)]
*  And so when you first got into actual coaching, you already knew how to kick then, just from watching movies and shit? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=532.0s)]
*  Somewhere. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=540.0s)]
*  Somewhere. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=541.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say I actually knew how to kick, but that's where it's imitation. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=542.0s)]
*  Life imitates art. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=545.0s)]
*  So that's my biggest thing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=546.0s)]
*  I used to watch these guys. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=548.0s)]
*  And you've got to realize these guys that's playing are actors, are real martial artists. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=549.0s)]
*  So they're using real techniques at the end of the day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=554.0s)]
*  So I just get to look at that and use it and just apply it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=557.0s)]
*  I love one of my favorite movies to watch is Blood and Bone with Michael Jai White, Kimbo Slice. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=561.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of techniques that he uses there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=567.0s)]
*  But that'd be dope to pull off. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=570.0s)]
*  So yeah, I would say that was my start into martial arts was the movies. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=572.0s)]
*  But my real actual training started when I was 18. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=577.0s)]
*  And so when you were 18, how long was it before you had your first fight? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=580.0s)]
*  Right. It actually didn't take long. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=584.0s)]
*  I think it was a little bit of nine months, 10 months into training. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=586.0s)]
*  And I had my first fight. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=591.0s)]
*  Was it an MMA fight? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was an MMA fight. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=594.0s)]
*  Yeah, so in Missouri and St. Louis, whatever. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=595.0s)]
*  So as amateurs, we didn't need the headgear. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=597.0s)]
*  We didn't need to wear shin guards and nothing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=600.0s)]
*  So you fought like a pro. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=602.0s)]
*  The only thing that you couldn't do was heel hooks and knee to the head. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=603.0s)]
*  No heel hooks? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=606.0s)]
*  No heel hooks, yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=607.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah, no heel hooks. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=609.0s)]
*  But all the other submissions were okay? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=610.0s)]
*  Yeah, and no elbows. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=611.0s)]
*  Every other submission was cool. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=612.0s)]
*  No elbows, no knees, no cuts. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=613.0s)]
*  And then no heel hooks. That was the only rule. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=615.0s)]
*  So just a few limitations. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=618.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=620.0s)]
*  So do they have a comprehensive amateur program there? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=621.0s)]
*  Or was it balanced? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=624.0s)]
*  Were you fighting someone that had experience? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=626.0s)]
*  Or were you just fighting another person? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=628.0s)]
*  No, I was just fighting another person, man. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=629.0s)]
*  I don't think it was balanced yet. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=630.0s)]
*  Even in 2012, everybody had the showdown. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=632.0s)]
*  So the promoter, putting fights together and everything. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=636.0s)]
*  But people were still trying to figure out actually the gym-wise, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=639.0s)]
*  how to develop a fighter, if that makes sense. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=642.0s)]
*  Because I feel like still to this day that a lot of MMA gyms are still not doing it right. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=646.0s)]
*  But that's a whole nother conversation for a whole nother day. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=650.0s)]
*  So a lot of these guys that was in amateur fighting just wanted to fight [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=652.0s)]
*  just to get the feel for it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=655.0s)]
*  And those were the types of guys I was fighting almost at the amateur level. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=656.0s)]
*  Well, we had dinner that one night. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=660.0s)]
*  We were talking about the difference between going to a big gym [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=662.0s)]
*  and the way you're doing it at a smaller gym. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=666.0s)]
*  And there's some interesting conversation to be had about that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=669.0s)]
*  Because you made some really good points about when you're in a smaller gym, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=672.0s)]
*  you get individualized attention and you're not getting lost in the crowd. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=676.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=680.0s)]
*  And that there's so much information out there already [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=681.0s)]
*  with all the videos that are out there and all the fights you can watch. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=684.0s)]
*  So sometimes it's good just to be... [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=688.0s)]
*  So my coach is a perfect example, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=691.0s)]
*  He'll have us working on the same thing over and over and over again. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=693.0s)]
*  And we know it. And we know it by heart beat. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=696.0s)]
*  And we'll tell the coach, hey coach, can we do something different? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=698.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I want you all to do this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=701.0s)]
*  And you need that type of discipline just to keep doing the same thing [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=703.0s)]
*  because that's how you actually work on your tools. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=706.0s)]
*  You work on the basics over and over again. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=709.0s)]
*  Then it becomes instinct. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=712.0s)]
*  So even though we have so much applied knowledge out there [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=714.0s)]
*  and so many things that we can do, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=717.0s)]
*  sometimes it's like the basic knowledge that we have. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=719.0s)]
*  And if we work with a smaller gym, we're able to focus on that a little bit more [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=721.0s)]
*  as a team instead of everybody just doing their own thing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=725.0s)]
*  Because I don't care what nobody says, like big gyms, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=728.0s)]
*  everybody's just doing their own thing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=730.0s)]
*  Everybody's just working with who they're working with. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=731.0s)]
*  They're not even working with the coach unless they got a name [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=733.0s)]
*  and they got a big fight coming up. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=735.0s)]
*  That's the thing, right? Because that's what I hear. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=736.0s)]
*  You get two arguments. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=738.0s)]
*  One of them is iron sharpens iron. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=739.0s)]
*  So if you go to ATT, if you're an American top team, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=741.0s)]
*  world-class facility, giant place, dormitories, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=745.0s)]
*  world-class guys coming from all over the world. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=749.0s)]
*  But when I've talked to fighters who train there, they say, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=752.0s)]
*  look, man, you get in there with some Russian dude you never met before [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=755.0s)]
*  and he's trying to kill you. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=757.0s)]
*  Yeah, big fight. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=758.0s)]
*  And there's no supervision. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=759.0s)]
*  If you're not a world-class guy, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=761.0s)]
*  if you're not a top-of-the-food chain guy that has a lot of money riding on him, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=763.0s)]
*  they'll put you in there with everybody who's in class. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=767.0s)]
*  Big fight. And you're going to have to learn. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=769.0s)]
*  You're going to have to sink or swim. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=770.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=771.0s)]
*  You have to develop and become that individual in order for them to work with you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=772.0s)]
*  But they're not going to develop you. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=775.0s)]
*  So a lot of guys get it twisted when they go to these big gyms [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=777.0s)]
*  and they think that they're going to be elevated because of the guys that they're around. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=780.0s)]
*  But at the same time, like you said, people are just trying to beat you up. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=784.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=786.0s)]
*  So you're not really learning anything. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=787.0s)]
*  So that's one thing I talk about structure. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=789.0s)]
*  So just because you're a big gym and you're able to have all these housing for fighters, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=792.0s)]
*  you got the big nice mats, you got the heavy bags and all this other stuff. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=796.0s)]
*  You got all the pretty stuff, but you have no structure within the gym. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=800.0s)]
*  A lot of guys should be working with certain people to develop their skills. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=803.0s)]
*  So let's say certain pros, high-level pros, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=807.0s)]
*  not saying that a high-level pro can't work with an amateur, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=810.0s)]
*  but certain amateurs shouldn't be working with certain pros. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=813.0s)]
*  They should be developed to a certain point where they're showing that they know enough, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=816.0s)]
*  and now they can move up and work with certain individuals. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=820.0s)]
*  Right. Not get fed to the wolves. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=822.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=824.0s)]
*  Because all it's going to do is hurt the young amateur. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=825.0s)]
*  And then sometimes amateurs be doing the wrong thing [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=828.0s)]
*  and be going too hard and could end up cutting a high-level pro. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=830.0s)]
*  And they might not be making a lot of money, but that's somebody that's a potential prospect. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=834.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=838.0s)]
*  But now they ain't got a fight coming up because they was going with this amateur [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=839.0s)]
*  because they ain't had nobody else to go with. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=841.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=843.0s)]
*  So it's a lot of things that play a part into having a big gym and a small gym. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=844.0s)]
*  But I just love having a small gym just because you get that actual attention that you need. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=848.0s)]
*  Well, it sounds like your coach is a fantastic coach. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=852.0s)]
*  He's one of the best in the world. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=854.0s)]
*  What's his name? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=855.0s)]
*  Joaquin Mercy Lago. So we got the same first name. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=856.0s)]
*  That's crazy. That's an odd name. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=858.0s)]
*  It's not a lot of those Joaquins out there. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=860.0s)]
*  So when you're... What is the name of the gym? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=863.0s)]
*  Mercy. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=866.0s)]
*  And when you're working with him, it's specifically with him and a bunch of other people? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=867.0s)]
*  So he's the head coach for MMA-wise. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=874.0s)]
*  And then we have Nick Simmons. So the gym itself is called Sawt Academy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=879.0s)]
*  It's a wrestling academy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=884.0s)]
*  So he has a lot of high-level prospect, high school wrestlers, middle school wrestlers, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=886.0s)]
*  some of the best wrestlers in the nation that come to him to learn wrestling. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=890.0s)]
*  So his name is Nick Simmons. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=895.0s)]
*  But I work with his older brother Andy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=896.0s)]
*  No, actually younger brother Andy Simmons. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=899.0s)]
*  That's who I work with. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=901.0s)]
*  And he's more my size and stuff like that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=902.0s)]
*  So I get a lot of high-level wrestling from him because both of them are Hall of Famers [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=904.0s)]
*  at Michigan State, which is pretty dope. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=908.0s)]
*  And so they got a nice revenue, not revenue, but a great career within wrestling. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=911.0s)]
*  Went undefeated for the longest time. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=920.0s)]
*  I think over 200, 300 bouts or something like that. Undefeated. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=922.0s)]
*  And then I got a conditioning coach at the HBI, Human Performance Institute. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=926.0s)]
*  Justin Hartley, he was an NFL player. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=930.0s)]
*  That's where we get all our conditioning work in. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=932.0s)]
*  So we don't have many, many guys. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=935.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we have enough to work with. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=937.0s)]
*  We also got a guy that works with our Jiu-Jitsu, who works at Magic, named Brendan Berry, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=940.0s)]
*  who does all our Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=944.0s)]
*  But the crazy thing about him, he's not a black belt. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=945.0s)]
*  He's not a high-level Jiu-Jitsu guy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=947.0s)]
*  He's somebody that's just passionate about Jiu-Jitsu, who watches it every day. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=949.0s)]
*  And he shows the stuff that actually works, but he's somebody that's committed to it, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=953.0s)]
*  and who watches it every day. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=958.0s)]
*  And that's who we learn Jiu-Jitsu from. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=959.0s)]
*  Well, that was the case a long time ago. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=961.0s)]
*  There was a lot of guys that were like blue belts and purple belts that were opening up schools, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=963.0s)]
*  because they didn't have a real good school around them. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=967.0s)]
*  And they knew that they could teach at least a base of fundamentals. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=970.0s)]
*  And if they were really excited and passionate about Jiu-Jitsu, they would grow with their students. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=973.0s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. And that's exactly what he's doing with us. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=979.0s)]
*  Because I can see Brandon going very far into being an instructor, going far into Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=981.0s)]
*  But just somebody that's not looking for anything out of it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=988.0s)]
*  He never asked me for any money or nothing like that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=992.0s)]
*  But he shows me a lot of things that helped me win the fight against Albert Duraya. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=994.0s)]
*  How to get the stand-up, how to get my guard back. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=998.0s)]
*  And it's just crazy, because in that fight, a lot of people had me pick the lose. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1001.0s)]
*  And thinking like, okay, Albert Duraya trains at this big gym at Extreme Couture and stuff like that. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1006.0s)]
*  He has all the tools, he has all the resources. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1012.0s)]
*  And then I go back to Michigan, and I don't have much. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1014.0s)]
*  But I got the people that's able to work on the things that we need to work on. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1016.0s)]
*  And we do it repeatedly until I get it down. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1020.0s)]
*  And then we're able to show that in the fight. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1023.0s)]
*  And I feel like that's what I'm saying. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1025.0s)]
*  We're actually showing what works within this game. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1027.0s)]
*  Because if you've got the right group of people that you're working with, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1031.0s)]
*  they can help advance you in your career and stuff like that, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1034.0s)]
*  then that's what you need to mess up with. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1037.0s)]
*  But a lot of fighters feel like they need to move on from the gym that they come from, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1039.0s)]
*  that they were developing well at, to go to a bigger gym. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1042.0s)]
*  And that's not the way to go always. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1045.0s)]
*  Not always, right? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1047.0s)]
*  It really does depend upon the environment, who the coach is, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1049.0s)]
*  and what kind of relationship we have with them. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1052.0s)]
*  But it seems like you've got a good one set up. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1054.0s)]
*  So how do you balance out how much grappling you do versus how much striking you do? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1056.0s)]
*  It seems like you prefer striking. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1062.0s)]
*  That seems like your level of expertise. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1065.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say the level of expertise, but that's where the money comes in. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1068.0s)]
*  That's where the money comes in? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1071.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's where the money comes in. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1073.0s)]
*  I just want to always be excited. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1074.0s)]
*  Now we're trying to switch the gears into just becoming the winner, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1076.0s)]
*  because now we've got money in the bank. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1079.0s)]
*  My biggest thing is when I went out for my first UFC fight with Kevin Holland, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1082.0s)]
*  I just chose to stand on the feet. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1087.0s)]
*  I could have took Kevin Holland down. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1089.0s)]
*  I could have put myself in a better position to win, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1091.0s)]
*  but I decided just to strike. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1093.0s)]
*  I fell on that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1095.0s)]
*  He beat me in the third round, and he got the advantage on me. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1096.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I want to make these fights exciting and fan appealing, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1100.0s)]
*  which even with the loss I had against Kevin Holland, people still wanted to watch me fight. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1105.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1108.0s)]
*  And then coming into my second fight with Ember, because Saq and I still chose... [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1109.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm mixing a little bit of takedown, but I let him back up. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1114.0s)]
*  I was like, I want to keep this on the feet. I want to keep going. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1117.0s)]
*  And then of course we did what we did. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1119.0s)]
*  So my whole course is just going through my career. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1121.0s)]
*  I just wanted to strike with these guys and get good knockouts so I can get a third check. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1123.0s)]
*  So you are thinking that way. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1127.0s)]
*  That's how I was thinking. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1129.0s)]
*  That's how I was thinking. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1131.0s)]
*  And now you're thinking I want to be a champion. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1132.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1134.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the shift, right? The pivot. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1135.0s)]
*  And sometimes guys get criticized for that, and I'm opposed to that criticism. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1138.0s)]
*  People are saying, oh, they're fighting boring. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1142.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know what you think is boring. I think baseball is boring. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1144.0s)]
*  I don't think fighting is ever boring. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1148.0s)]
*  Because there's always a potential for something crazy to happen. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1150.0s)]
*  But the intelligent fighters know how to win. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1153.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, like Floyd Mayweather. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1156.0s)]
*  Like for me, when I watch him, and obviously you got some of the best defensive fighter is him. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1158.0s)]
*  But when you watch him fight, you can call it boring if you want to. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1163.0s)]
*  But when you really pay attention in the things that he's doing and how he's moving around fighters [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1166.0s)]
*  and how he's evading these punches and able to counterfight us, like, bro, that's very intriguing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1171.0s)]
*  Masterful. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1176.0s)]
*  Masterful. And then now we talk about Izzy. It's the same way. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1177.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1180.0s)]
*  Same exact thing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1181.0s)]
*  That was my argument about the Jared Cannonier fight. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1182.0s)]
*  They were like, oh, he should have engaged more. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1184.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, he's fighting Jared Cannonier. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1186.0s)]
*  You can't engage all the time recklessly with that dude. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1188.0s)]
*  That dude's a powerhouse. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1191.0s)]
*  And that's the thing. I'm not mad at Izzy for what he done, because that's what he keeps doing, right? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1193.0s)]
*  In order to retain his title. And I hope he keeps doing. I hope he does it against Alex Pryor. I pray. I pray. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1197.0s)]
*  I want to talk to you about that fight. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1202.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1203.0s)]
*  Because it's kind of your division, but maybe not in the future. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1204.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? Have you decided? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1207.0s)]
*  Actually, yeah, I already decided. I'm going down to 1-7. I'm about to get that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1209.0s)]
*  But you're going to have this fight with Chris Curtis? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1213.0s)]
*  Yes, Chris Curtis. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1215.0s)]
*  And that's at 85. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1216.0s)]
*  That's at 85. They wanted me to have one more fight at 185. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1217.0s)]
*  They was like, well, if you want to make this good little money, we sign at 185. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1220.0s)]
*  Fight CC, and then we can talk about you moving down to 1-7. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1223.0s)]
*  Are they opposed to you moving down to 1-7? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1226.0s)]
*  I don't think they're opposed, but they only seen me at 185. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1228.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1231.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? So they're like, well, first off, because there's so many different things, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1232.0s)]
*  because people haven't seen me fight at 170, even though the majority of my fights are welterweight fights. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1234.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1238.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. Yeah. So the majority of my career since I was 18, since I've been an amateur, everything, and going into pro, I was at 175. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1239.0s)]
*  But dude, you're pretty fucking slow. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1246.0s)]
*  Yeah, I am pretty slow, but don't let these muscles deceive you. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1248.0s)]
*  I think Michael Jow White talked about it before too. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1252.0s)]
*  When he's bulking, a lot of people think he's bigger than, well, he is bigger, but they think he's smaller when they see him. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1255.0s)]
*  But when he's cut up and he's clean, that's when they think he's his biggest, because they see all the muscle and they're so defined and everything. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1262.0s)]
*  But he's actually lighter. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1268.0s)]
*  But he's actually lighter. And it's the same thing with me. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1269.0s)]
*  So it's just that perception that people see, like, oh, they think I'm a lot bigger than what I really am. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1271.0s)]
*  Actually, in that Nasha Deen fight, I walked into that fight at 185. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1276.0s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1279.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. At 185. I actually cut too much damn weight. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1280.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1284.0s)]
*  I was walking around at 181. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1285.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1287.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even the PI guys, they can tell you. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1288.0s)]
*  So what do you weigh right now? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1290.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a little heavy right now. I've been eating good. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1291.0s)]
*  Texas barbecue. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1293.0s)]
*  Yeah, big facts. But I never get up to 200. So I'm probably like 195. I never get up to 200. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1295.0s)]
*  Interesting. That's very light for 85. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1299.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1301.0s)]
*  Especially when you look at some of those giant dudes. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, all of them. Shoot Nasha Deen, Alex Pereira, cutting from 240. You know what I'm saying? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1304.0s)]
*  Jared Kennedy used to be a heavyweight. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1308.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Jared Kennedy is as big as it gets. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1310.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, come on now. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1312.0s)]
*  He's as big as it gets at 85. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1313.0s)]
*  Well, that was what I was saying about Izzy. Like, the way he fought him was the perfect way to fight him. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1314.0s)]
*  Oh, he was smart. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1317.0s)]
*  You got to fight Jared Kennedy like that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1318.0s)]
*  The only person that I give any slack to is Jared Kennedy himself. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1323.0s)]
*  Because he had the best opportunity, right? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1324.0s)]
*  And I feel like even if he didn't win, he still could have brought the fight a little bit better. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1326.0s)]
*  Because Izzy doesn't mind fight, you know what I mean? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1330.0s)]
*  But he wants you to bring the fight to him. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1333.0s)]
*  But you see Jared Kennedy trying to clinch up against him, trying to do tactics I ain't never seen him do before. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1335.0s)]
*  What happened to the killer gorilla? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1339.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? What happened to the rocks that you keep in your pocket? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1341.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, all these little different things that give you mental fortitude, but you fought scared that night. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1344.0s)]
*  I don't care. I don't care. Nobody say, Jared Kennedy fought scared that night. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1348.0s)]
*  Really, he fought scared? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1351.0s)]
*  I never seen him fight. I mean, when he fought Jack Ramsey, he ran through him. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1352.0s)]
*  But that's a different fighter. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1356.0s)]
*  When you fight Izzy, I think you're fighting a supercomputer. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1359.0s)]
*  When that dude's standing in front of you and he's throwing all those feints and movements. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1363.0s)]
*  We can debate all day, but my thing is when that happens. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1366.0s)]
*  But my thing is if I was to fight Izzy, you got to put that pressure on him like Kevin Gasselman did. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1369.0s)]
*  And now, of course, Izzy could have gotten better from that fight, which he more likely did. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1374.0s)]
*  He certainly did, but still you never seen him fight that type of fighter again. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1378.0s)]
*  You know, with Kevin Gasselman being in the southpaw, a shorter fighter, an inside fighter, putting pressure on him. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1381.0s)]
*  He never fought that type of individual again. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1387.0s)]
*  And I feel like my striking and my stature fits like a Kevin Gasselman. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1389.0s)]
*  And I feel like my footwork is a little better than Kevin Gasselman as well. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1394.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't just be going straight in. I would hit different angles on Izzy. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1398.0s)]
*  That's how you beat Izzy, I feel like. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1402.0s)]
*  It's taking it out of a kickboxing range. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1403.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Putting it in a boxing range and fighting inside. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1405.0s)]
*  And then guess what? Mixing in the takedowns. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1408.0s)]
*  But guess what? It's kind of hard to take down Izzy. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1410.0s)]
*  But at the same time, like even with Robin Whitaker, a lot of people say he probably won that fight. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1413.0s)]
*  But I feel like he didn't do enough though. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1418.0s)]
*  You know, there's so many little debates that you can put up behind it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1419.0s)]
*  But my thing is, I feel like Izzy is able to be finished in certain positions that he puts himself in. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1422.0s)]
*  Because there's a lot of things that he do because of his reach. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1428.0s)]
*  He leans back a lot to try to counter away from punches. Right? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1431.0s)]
*  But if you can find that angle, you can see the holes open in there because his body is there, his chin is available. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1435.0s)]
*  You know, you can find that punch. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1440.0s)]
*  I felt like Jerrick Keneally could have exposed a lot of that if he fought the way that he fights a lot of other guys. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1442.0s)]
*  You just have to run the risk of getting knocked out in the process. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1448.0s)]
*  There it is. There it is. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1450.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? If you're scared of getting knocked out, then you probably shouldn't be in this game. Right or wrong. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1451.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think he probably felt like he'll find that opportunity somewhere in the fight. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1456.0s)]
*  So it's like don't get knocked out while you're trying to find that opportunity. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1461.0s)]
*  Yeah, but at the same time, it's scary though. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1464.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1467.0s)]
*  You know, it's scary. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1468.0s)]
*  So my biggest thing is just trying to figure out how Mike Tyson, one of my favorite fighters, like he always put pressures on guys. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1469.0s)]
*  Like you could knock out Mike if he came towards you, but he was evasive. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1475.0s)]
*  You know, he moving his head the whole time, moving his feet, shifting everything. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1479.0s)]
*  And it was all about angles, but he never let the pressure down because he could probably get knocked out. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1482.0s)]
*  You know, he just worked on his defense. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1488.0s)]
*  So even with Robert Whitaker, that first fight that they had, that's why he got knocked out because he added so much pressure, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1490.0s)]
*  but he left a lot of holes open for Izzy to expose. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1495.0s)]
*  But if you could have just worked on just keeping your hands up and working inside and moving your angles and stuff, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1498.0s)]
*  you probably could have did a little better on the second end, which he did, taking them down and trying to, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1503.0s)]
*  but you trying to game plan on how to take the belt. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1507.0s)]
*  Like, bro, you got to beat that individual. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1509.0s)]
*  And I don't know how you feel about that, but my biggest thing is just like you can't just like barely beat a champion and be like, all right, it's my belt now. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1511.0s)]
*  You know, that's just me and my opinion. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1518.0s)]
*  And that's how it's always been. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1520.0s)]
*  I kind of see that. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1522.0s)]
*  But whoever wins the fight wins the fight. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1523.0s)]
*  If someone wins a clear cut unanimous decision for a title, that's still winning. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah. Where have we seen that, man? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1531.0s)]
*  Like, you know, with Dominic Reyes and John Jones. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1533.0s)]
*  Valentina, I feel like Valentina lost that last fight. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1535.0s)]
*  Very close fight. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1537.0s)]
*  Very close fight. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1539.0s)]
*  But debatable that she lost. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1540.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1542.0s)]
*  But at the same time. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1543.0s)]
*  Well, debatable Robert Whitaker and Izzy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1544.0s)]
*  That's debatable, too. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1546.0s)]
*  But the thing is, don't forget debate. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1547.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to take that thing. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1549.0s)]
*  You got to take it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1550.0s)]
*  I feel that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1551.0s)]
*  I completely appreciate that. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1552.0s)]
*  I think Robert Whitaker was a way better fighter in the second fight. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1554.0s)]
*  I think losing to Izzy just reignited that fire inside of him. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1556.0s)]
*  I think fighters and you know, you could speak to this better than me, but I think fighters, they go in sort of cycles. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1560.0s)]
*  Like sometimes they're just not totally focused and motivated or maybe they're overwhelmed by pressure or, you know. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1566.0s)]
*  So many different things because you don't never know what's going on outside. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1574.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1578.0s)]
*  In their lives and stuff. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1579.0s)]
*  But for Robert Whitaker, I mean, he went into the fight as a winner. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1580.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember Michael Bisbee said something like Robert Whitaker didn't look as confident in the second round. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1583.0s)]
*  But my thing is though, like Robert Whitaker getting up to that title fight, he's been winning in decisions, right? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1590.0s)]
*  So he got used to just beating guys and taking them to a point where he's just out pointing them for real. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1596.0s)]
*  You know, even with the Jerry Kennedy, when he broke Jerry Kennedy's forearm. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1602.0s)]
*  It ain't like he was hunting for the finish. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1605.0s)]
*  He's just out pointing, just touching, just touching guys. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1607.0s)]
*  You know, you think a man with one arm, you probably be able to get him out of there. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1609.0s)]
*  But did he know he had one arm though? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1613.0s)]
*  He didn't know his arm was broken. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1615.0s)]
*  I ain't saying he knew it, but at the same time, if you apply that type of pressure and you put it on somebody, you know what I'm saying? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1616.0s)]
*  Like you can only do so much with a broken arm. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1622.0s)]
*  But shout out to Jerry Kennedy for even fighting like that, right? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1627.0s)]
*  So I was hoping that same dog would come out in the Izzy fight. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1628.0s)]
*  But regardless, like we skipping points, you know, but. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1630.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying, but you know, it's armchair quarterbacking, right? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1633.0s)]
*  Big face. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1637.0s)]
*  So with Robert Whitaker, you know what I'm saying? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1638.0s)]
*  Like I felt like in my mind, he just got used to just coasting for a lot of his fights because it wasn't close. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1642.0s)]
*  Like he would win every round when he fought, what, Kevin Gaslim, when he fought Darren Till, you know what I'm saying? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1648.0s)]
*  Like he was just beating these guys by decision and fairly easy. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1653.0s)]
*  And Jerry Kennedy, fairly easy. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1655.0s)]
*  And then when he got to Izzy, he thought he could win the same type of way. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1657.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1661.0s)]
*  Well, I think he's also I think the Izzy fight, it's just my opinion. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1662.0s)]
*  But I think he was suffering from those fights with Yoel Romero, too. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1666.0s)]
*  When you fight Yoel Romero, that motherfucker takes something from you. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1670.0s)]
*  He takes it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1675.0s)]
*  That's like fighting a brick wall. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1676.0s)]
*  That dude is. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1678.0s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1679.0s)]
*  He's different. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1680.0s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1681.0s)]
*  He's so different. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1682.0s)]
*  And those fights were horrendous. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1683.0s)]
*  Remember he got knocked down and hurt. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1684.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and got back up like a jeep. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1685.0s)]
*  You know, he tried to do the same little tactic that Yoel did, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1687.0s)]
*  Side kick to the knee. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1691.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1692.0s)]
*  Well, Yoel fucked his knee up in that first fight. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1693.0s)]
*  What do you think about that side kick to the knee? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1695.0s)]
*  That's controversial, right? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1697.0s)]
*  I mean, it's legal. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1698.0s)]
*  It's legal. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1699.0s)]
*  I mean, I haven't done it, you know what I'm saying, to anybody. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1700.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the opportunity to do it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1703.0s)]
*  But if I see somebody with a straight leg, I would never do it if somebody has a strong stance. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1704.0s)]
*  It wouldn't make any sense to do it then. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1709.0s)]
*  But if I see somebody has like a Sean Strickland, as a perfect example. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1711.0s)]
*  If you stand straight up. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1714.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm killing that knee. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1718.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1719.0s)]
*  Well, John Jones is the master at that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1720.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1722.0s)]
*  All that length. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1723.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1724.0s)]
*  He's the best at using distance. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1725.0s)]
*  No one's better at using distance. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1726.0s)]
*  John's the best. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1728.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is the best because of his attributes, you know what I mean? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1729.0s)]
*  Because like the 84, you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1731.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1733.0s)]
*  His reach, like that's crazy. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1734.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, the legs. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1735.0s)]
*  I don't know how long, but your legs is longer, you know? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1736.0s)]
*  So we're having all that reach. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1738.0s)]
*  I feel like that's what, but a lot of people are like, oh, he's like one of the best defensive or best footwork. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1740.0s)]
*  I'm like, nah, not at all. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1745.0s)]
*  Well, it's not a footwork thing. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1746.0s)]
*  It's using his attributes. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1747.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what some people say. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1748.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse has the best footwork. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1749.0s)]
*  Footwork, big facts. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1750.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1751.0s)]
*  Hold on now, hold on now, hold on now. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1752.0s)]
*  You know, I got some good footwork too. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1753.0s)]
*  You got very good footwork, but come on, man. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1754.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse is off the charts. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1756.0s)]
*  Oh, no, Mighty, that's my top one. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1758.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse would come in like this and then all of a sudden he'd be over here. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1759.0s)]
*  No, big facts, big facts. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1762.0s)]
*  You know, I got to put myself in the mix. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1763.0s)]
*  I understand. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1765.0s)]
*  I understand. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1766.0s)]
*  No, I love Mighty Mouse, man. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1767.0s)]
*  Shout out to him, man. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1768.0s)]
*  He definitely on my pound for pound. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1769.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1771.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1772.0s)]
*  Of all time, of all time. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1773.0s)]
*  And he's the guy who talked about having all the stuff in your personal life in order. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1775.0s)]
*  Last time he was here, he was like, you know, a big part of my success is having a stable [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1779.0s)]
*  family life, having a wife, having, you know, not having any personal problems, no graces, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1783.2s)]
*  people in your life, no bullshit that drags you down. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1788.0s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1791.0s)]
*  Which is a problem with fighters. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1792.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it can apply negative energy into your life and into your training. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1793.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1797.0s)]
*  You're not able to focus on the things that's really important as in being able to provide [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1798.0s)]
*  for your family because this is how we eat. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1802.4s)]
*  And if you got to focus on other stuff and try to get your life in order like a John [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1804.4s)]
*  Jones, and that's crazy thing. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1808.4s)]
*  John Jones be going through crazy stuff. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1809.4s)]
*  The craziest. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1811.4s)]
*  And still able to maintain on the highest level. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1812.4s)]
*  And still to go. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1814.4s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1815.4s)]
*  Remember when he said to Daniel Cormier, I fought you and beat you after I did Coke. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1816.4s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1820.4s)]
*  I was like, oh no. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1821.4s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1822.4s)]
*  Because you know, Daniel's in there training with Cain Velasquez and drinking only water. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1823.4s)]
*  Man, and that's wild to me that John Jones, but I feel like he probably been doing it [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1827.4s)]
*  for so long that it became natural for him because obviously he was a champion at the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1832.32s)]
*  age of 23 years old. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1836.32s)]
*  And he probably was always doing this little crazy stuff. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1838.32s)]
*  I mean, Kobe Covey was talking about it when he was roommates with him. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1840.32s)]
*  He was always a wild boy. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1843.32s)]
*  Always loved to party. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1844.32s)]
*  So it was just something that he became accustomed to and a part of. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1845.32s)]
*  But sometimes I'd be like, brother, you ain't getting tired of that? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1848.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1850.32s)]
*  You ain't getting worn out? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1851.32s)]
*  You would think so. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1852.32s)]
*  I mean, my man, how old is John now? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1853.32s)]
*  John's in his 30s. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1855.32s)]
*  32? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1856.32s)]
*  I think he's a little older than that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1857.32s)]
*  How old is John? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1859.32s)]
*  Is he 34? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1860.32s)]
*  I mean, John won the title, the youngest ever. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1862.32s)]
*  This is the time to come back, I feel like, for John. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1864.32s)]
*  If he waits any longer, I feel like he needs to stay away. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1866.32s)]
*  Well, according to John, the holdup is Stipe. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1869.32s)]
*  Stipe did not want to sign for the fight for December 10th. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1872.32s)]
*  And I don't know what that is, whether they didn't offer Stipe enough money. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1876.32s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1880.32s)]
*  So I don't want to speak out of line. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1882.32s)]
*  But I think they're targeting when Francis' knee is recovered. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1884.32s)]
*  Francis and Gano, John Jones fight. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1888.32s)]
*  Oh, okay, so they're getting rid of Stipe. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1890.32s)]
*  Because I feel like before he fights Francis, he needs to fight somebody like Stipe or Tuovasa. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1892.32s)]
*  Somebody that really shows that you belong to heavyweight before you just fight for it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1898.32s)]
*  I would say that for anybody else. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1902.32s)]
*  For anybody else, I would say that. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1904.32s)]
*  But when you're talking about the greatest light heavyweight, maybe the greatest mixed martial artist of all time, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1905.32s)]
*  let him fight in heavyweight for the title. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1910.32s)]
*  I would have said that probably two years ago. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1912.32s)]
*  But it's time. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1914.32s)]
*  But he's training. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1916.32s)]
*  The thing about John is, John's wild, but he's also smart. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1917.32s)]
*  One of the things that John's doing is putting on so much weight. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1921.32s)]
*  He's fucking huge now. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1925.32s)]
*  John's like 255 jacked, all filled out. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1927.32s)]
*  If he can maintain that endurance and keep that kind of pace that he had at light heavyweight at 205. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1931.32s)]
*  And if you look at his strength and conditioning work that he's doing, man, he's doing it the right way. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1937.32s)]
*  It's nasty. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1941.32s)]
*  But this ain't lifting weights, though. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1942.32s)]
*  It's not lifting weights. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1944.32s)]
*  You already know. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1945.32s)]
*  And to be honest with you, we don't see what goes on. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1946.32s)]
*  And I know he's training hard. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1949.32s)]
*  Well, first off, he did change the team, obviously. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1951.32s)]
*  He got kicked out of Jason. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1953.32s)]
*  I don't know the story behind that. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1955.32s)]
*  I don't know the story either. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1957.32s)]
*  Yeah, so my biggest thing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1958.32s)]
*  So yeah, all right, who you training with now? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1959.32s)]
*  Who you sparring with? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1961.32s)]
*  Who you working with? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1962.32s)]
*  Those are the things that I want to see. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1963.32s)]
*  I don't want to just see you in the weight room. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1964.32s)]
*  Is he doing something with Henry Cejudo? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1966.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1968.32s)]
*  I have no clue. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1969.32s)]
*  I think he was working with him for a minute. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1970.32s)]
*  A lot of guys working with Henry Cejudo. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1972.32s)]
*  I like what Henry's doing. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1974.32s)]
*  I like what Henry's doing. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1975.32s)]
*  That's a focused man. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1977.32s)]
*  Big facts, man. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1978.32s)]
*  He's a focused man. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1979.32s)]
*  And he keeping himself involved, for sure. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1980.32s)]
*  Even though he's not fighting, he want to come back, for sure. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1982.32s)]
*  Well, they're talking about him fighting Aljamain Sterling for the title, which I hope takes place. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1985.32s)]
*  Yeah, I hope it takes place as well. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1990.32s)]
*  That's a very good fight. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1991.32s)]
*  I like that fight a lot. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1992.32s)]
*  For him to come right back straight to the title makes sense. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1994.32s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1997.32s)]
*  Two division champion, Olympic gold medalist, one of the greats. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=1998.32s)]
*  Yeah, you right. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2001.32s)]
*  And actually, that was the original weight class that Henry came from, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2002.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2005.32s)]
*  So it was 125 and 135. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2006.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, he won at 25, but he also won at 35. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2007.32s)]
*  I feel like him coming back at 35 to fight Aljo is a very legit fight. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2012.32s)]
*  I like that fight a lot. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2017.32s)]
*  To be honest with you, I think Aljamain would take that one. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2018.32s)]
*  Aljamain's a motherfucker, dude. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2021.32s)]
*  I think he'd take that one low-key, bro. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2023.32s)]
*  And right now, Aljamain's a champion. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2024.32s)]
*  Real champ. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2026.32s)]
*  Yeah, like the way he fucked over TJ Dillashaw, he beat the shit out of him. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2027.32s)]
*  He beat the shit out of that dude. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2031.32s)]
*  And I know TJ's shoulder was fucked up, but dude, the way Aljamain fought Pyotr Yon in [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2032.32s)]
*  the second fight, dude, he's a champion now. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2038.32s)]
*  There's a thing that happens to a guy when he comes into his own and you go, you know [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2040.32s)]
*  what? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2044.32s)]
*  I can't wait to see him again because I think he's going to be even better. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2045.32s)]
*  That's how I feel about Aljo right now. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2047.32s)]
*  You realize the confidence is there. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2049.3199999999997s)]
*  And when you talk about, for 135, the physique that Aljamain has, the type of shape that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2052.3199999999997s)]
*  he's in. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2057.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2058.3199999999997s)]
*  He ain't looking like other 135s. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2059.32s)]
*  He's the perfect 135. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2061.32s)]
*  It's like the perfect amount of weight cutting. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2063.32s)]
*  He's got his diet dialed in. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2066.32s)]
*  He comes out shredded as fuck, but he also has great cardio. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2067.32s)]
*  And he's long, too. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2071.32s)]
*  Yes, for 35, he's big, dude. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2072.32s)]
*  He's walking around 176 when I saw him. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2074.32s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2077.32s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2078.32s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2079.32s)]
*  That's why I know I'll be cool at getting down to 170 because I ain't got to cut a massive [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2080.32s)]
*  amount of weight. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2084.32s)]
*  I'm not going to clean up my diet. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2085.32s)]
*  The biggest I'd probably cut is 20. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2086.32s)]
*  Well, if you were walking around at 181 before you started at 185, that seems easy for you [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2089.32s)]
*  to make 170. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2096.32s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2097.32s)]
*  I was walking around at 182, 185 when I was 21. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2098.32s)]
*  Shoot, shoot, shoot. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2103.32s)]
*  I think how long have I been walking? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2106.32s)]
*  So since I was 18, going up to 23 years old, I was walking around that way. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2109.32s)]
*  I didn't actually start to fill out until I didn't get any fights at 170. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2114.32s)]
*  It makes sense that they want to see you cut the weight, though. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2117.32s)]
*  Because you see, there's so many problems. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2122.32s)]
*  Hamzah is the biggest problem. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2124.32s)]
*  Trying to get down to 170 and the dude misses it by eight pounds, which is fucked up the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2126.32s)]
*  whole card. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2130.32s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2131.32s)]
*  Now, hold on. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2132.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2133.32s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2134.32s)]
*  And I love to talk about this, too, because I don't think the UFC set this up like no [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2135.32s)]
*  crazy stuff. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2137.32s)]
*  I ain't trying to be on no Brennan Shaw. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2138.32s)]
*  Nah. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2139.32s)]
*  I ain't trying to be on no Brennan. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2140.32s)]
*  But low key, it just worked out too well. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2141.32s)]
*  It did work out too well, but that's how things happen sometimes. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2144.32s)]
*  You think so? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2146.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's my whole life. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2147.32s)]
*  It's your whole life? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2148.32s)]
*  All right, man. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2149.32s)]
*  I get it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2150.32s)]
*  I get it, too. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2151.32s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2152.32s)]
*  Things just work out sometimes. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2153.32s)]
*  Yeah, big fights. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2154.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2155.32s)]
*  That was a situation where it was the best case scenario in terms of options, because [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2156.32s)]
*  Kevin Holland had fought at 185 before, and he was available, and he was willing. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2159.96s)]
*  And then they got in a squabble backstage. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2165.56s)]
*  And so they said, all right, let's just make this at 180. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2167.84s)]
*  And Kevin's like, good, because Kevin was already supposed to fight Daniel Rodriguez [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2170.24s)]
*  at 180. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2173.4799999999996s)]
*  All that made sense. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2174.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2175.4799999999996s)]
*  The guy who got fucked over is the leech. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2176.4799999999996s)]
*  But the thing is, though, and that's the thing. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2177.4799999999996s)]
*  It really didn't make no sense, because why are they fighting at 180? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2179.72s)]
*  And then why did they just put it on the card last minute? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2182.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, they had no other options. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  The only other option was cancel the card. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2187.4199999999996s)]
*  What is the option? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2189.72s)]
*  Why would they have to cancel? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2190.72s)]
*  They don't want to fight. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2191.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2192.72s)]
*  I'm not talking about, like, no, no. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2193.72s)]
*  I'm talking about why even put Kevin Holland versus, what's the homeboy name? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2194.72s)]
*  D-Rod. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2197.7999999999997s)]
*  Why did they put that fight on the card and why is it catchweight? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2198.8s)]
*  Kevin Holland can make the weight. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2201.1600000000003s)]
*  D-Rod has always fought at 170. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2202.1600000000003s)]
*  So why is he already making up the mind, oh, I want to fight at 180? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2203.8s)]
*  Well, they had made that arrangement far in advance. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2207.44s)]
*  And I think- [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2210.0800000000004s)]
*  But no, it was the last minute fight that they put on. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2211.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, it wasn't like the day of. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2212.8s)]
*  Daniel Rodriguez and Kevin Holland- [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2215.6400000000003s)]
*  All I'm saying is just, for it to be at 180 and them to make that decision to make it [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2217.6400000000003s)]
*  at 180, that's all I'm talking about. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2222.32s)]
*  Because then also Tony Ferguson versus G. Leang, that fight didn't make no sense. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2224.04s)]
*  When they made the fight, that fight didn't make no sense to me. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2227.76s)]
*  Well, that fight made sense to me. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2229.92s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2231.0800000000004s)]
*  It made sense to me because Tony Ferguson's coming off a knockout loss to Chandler. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2232.0800000000004s)]
*  And then- [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2236.1200000000003s)]
*  Moving up to 170? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2237.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing about it is, I think as you get older, and I think it becomes more [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  and more difficult for you to make the weight and you feel weakened by the weight cut. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2243.8s)]
*  Daniel Rodriguez, the reason why that made sense, if you look how big he looked against [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2247.48s)]
*  Lee Jing Lee on, and what I mean big, I mean like carrying body fat. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2251.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2253.88s)]
*  He chubby. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2254.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2255.88s)]
*  He's in shape. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2257.0s)]
*  He's in shape, but he's just not ripped. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2258.0s)]
*  He's just got that Cain Velasquez style body where they never look shredded, but they're [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2260.84s)]
*  always in shape. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2265.52s)]
*  And I think that he was probably heavy and he said, look, I'll take the fight, but I'm [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2266.52s)]
*  heavy right now. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2270.48s)]
*  I'm not going to make 170, I'll kill myself. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2271.48s)]
*  So let's do it at 180. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2274.0s)]
*  And Kevin's like, fine. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2275.0s)]
*  I fight at 185 all the time, we're good. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2276.0s)]
*  So it's got all the pieces of a conspiracy theory, but there's logic behind it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2278.96s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  Because the Hamzats and Diaz make sense only because UFC don't want Diaz to come on, you [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2285.44s)]
*  know what I'm saying? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2289.6s)]
*  And be able to shine off of the top. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2290.6s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2291.6s)]
*  But it sort of didn't make sense though, right? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2292.6s)]
*  Because a lot of people are like, Jesus Christ, Hamzat's so big. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2293.6s)]
*  Diaz has fought at 155. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2296.04s)]
*  Hamzat's coming in. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  This motherfucker's like- [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2299.8799999999997s)]
*  It's an easy kill for Hamzat. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2300.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big, big- [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2301.8799999999997s)]
*  Easy money. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2302.8799999999997s)]
*  And then also you help develop, even though Hamzat's still got a crazy following, but [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2303.8799999999997s)]
*  it's still not the American base. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2307.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2309.2s)]
*  So it helps build his name. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2310.2s)]
*  So that fight did make sense for me right there. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2311.24s)]
*  But then it's like the whole switch up. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2313.72s)]
*  I'm like, bro, that's too perfect because then you have Kevin Hollen and Hamzat that [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2315.56s)]
*  had their whole little dispute, right? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2319.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2320.7599999999998s)]
*  And you already got Kevin Hollen who didn't have to cut no weight. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2321.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's the thing about even Kevin, shout out to him, he wasn't cutting the weight for [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2323.72s)]
*  real at 185. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2326.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2328.7999999999997s)]
*  Like my man would just walk around smoking, doing this little thing and walking to the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2329.7999999999997s)]
*  cage and he'd fight at 185. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2334.52s)]
*  So they had that fight at 180 and then tell Hamzat, well, not when I say tell Hamzat, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2335.52s)]
*  but Hamzat said himself that the doctor told him to stop cutting weight. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2338.9199999999996s)]
*  Hamzat was like, oh, well, I can make it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2342.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2344.6s)]
*  So I don't even think it's on the fighters, but I feel like the UFC was able to mess this [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2345.6s)]
*  up a little too well. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2348.8s)]
*  Well, let me tell you, because I know. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2350.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm the scene. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2352.08s)]
*  I talked to Dana when the shit went down. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2353.92s)]
*  He's like, this is a fucking mess. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2356.12s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2358.56s)]
*  He goes, I don't know what we're going to do. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2359.56s)]
*  Big fan. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2360.56s)]
*  So they were in chaos and then they masterminded, they got together and they brainstormed. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2361.56s)]
*  They said, okay, what if we do this and this and this? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2365.96s)]
*  And it turned out like we were talking about it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2369.2s)]
*  It was a better card. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2370.92s)]
*  It was a better way better way. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2371.92s)]
*  Ferguson versus Diaz, a competitive matchup. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2373.48s)]
*  That made sense. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2376.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, Hamzat versus Kevin Hollen. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2377.6800000000003s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2379.04s)]
*  I'm not arguing that. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2380.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it should have been. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2381.04s)]
*  I think Lee Jin-Liang got fucked. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2384.04s)]
*  Oh, he got played. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2385.76s)]
*  Because he's so small. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2386.76s)]
*  He even said it too. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2387.76s)]
*  But D-Rod is still a 170 fighter though. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2388.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2393.08s)]
*  But he do cut a lot of weight though. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2394.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2395.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2396.32s)]
*  And my thing is, but G-Liang, he had to put in that extra work in order to get that weight [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2397.32s)]
*  down to 170. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2400.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2401.52s)]
*  Because G-Liang is a ripped guy. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2402.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2403.52s)]
*  So I know it's hard to even try to get to the 170 weight class for himself. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2404.52s)]
*  So he did have a little disadvantage. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2408.48s)]
*  I felt like G-Liang won that fight too, bro. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2410.0s)]
*  I felt like he did enough to win. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2412.0s)]
*  It was so close. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2413.8s)]
*  But it was close though. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2414.8s)]
*  He was most certainly a very close fight. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2415.8s)]
*  But then, and shout out to Neil Magny who just finished D-Rod. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2417.48s)]
*  Because Neil Magny is one of the most underappreciated guys in the UFC. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2422.04s)]
*  Yeah, Loki. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2424.96s)]
*  That guy has Cardi O. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2425.96s)]
*  The pace that dude puts on people. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2427.96s)]
*  He's such a workman. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2430.4s)]
*  He just comes in and just constant volume, long reach. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2431.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  I feel like Neil Magny, he does a good job of getting guys to fight his style. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2439.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2440.92s)]
*  He takes his time with guys. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2441.92s)]
*  And guys take that pace but then don't realize, okay, oh, time is getting ate up right now. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2442.92s)]
*  And Neil Magny does a good job of timing guys up. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2447.0s)]
*  Just using that long job. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2449.8s)]
*  It's boring. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2450.8s)]
*  I ain't going to lie to you. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2451.8s)]
*  It's so big. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2452.8s)]
*  Even though when you say, oh, it's not boring, it's masterful. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2453.8s)]
*  But there's a lot of things I be seeing Neil Magny do. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2454.8s)]
*  And I ain't going to lie to you. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2456.52s)]
*  I be falling asleep. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2457.52s)]
*  I be nodding off. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2458.52s)]
*  You're a wild man. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2459.68s)]
*  I am a wild man. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2460.68s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2461.68s)]
*  Well, speaking of Neil Magny, and I'm glad he got a win because you never know with the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2462.68s)]
*  UFC losses and stuff like that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2465.92s)]
*  That Shavcock kid though, the undefeated. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2468.2s)]
*  He demolished Neil Magny, bro. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2470.24s)]
*  And what, he got him out the first round? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2474.16s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's good. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2475.68s)]
*  He's good. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2477.48s)]
*  He's under the radar. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2478.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2479.48s)]
*  With mainstream people, they do not know how Shav. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2480.48s)]
*  That's the real Hamza killer to me. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2482.8s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2484.48s)]
*  With what, 16 finishes, 17 finishes? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2485.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2487.48s)]
*  And he does everything. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2488.48s)]
*  He's a striker, grappler, everything. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2490.44s)]
*  I think he got a fight coming up against Jeff Neil. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2491.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2494.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2495.44s)]
*  That's a banger. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2496.44s)]
*  That's a banger. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2497.44s)]
*  I like Jeff Neil now. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2498.44s)]
*  Jeff Neil's back. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2499.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2500.44s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2501.44s)]
*  He went through a period of time where he was dealing with his own bullshit and wasn't [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2502.44s)]
*  really totally focused. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2505.12s)]
*  I mean, almost, if I'm not mistaken, almost died or something. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2506.12s)]
*  He was in the hospital. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2509.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2510.64s)]
*  He had a really bad infection. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2511.64s)]
*  Bad infection? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2512.64s)]
*  Yeah, real bad. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2513.64s)]
*  So it took him out for a little minute. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2514.64s)]
*  And then recovering from that was difficult. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2516.12s)]
*  And then he had some personal life shit. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2518.36s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2520.08s)]
*  But now he's back. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2521.08s)]
*  He looks like the Jeff. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2522.08s)]
*  When Jeff Neil fought Mike Perry, I was like, this motherfucker's a dark horse. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2523.08s)]
*  Yeah, almost done. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2526.04s)]
*  Because he's got timing, man. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2527.36s)]
*  His timing and footwork. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2528.92s)]
*  When Jeff Neil's on, he's one of the best guys in the division. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2530.16s)]
*  I can agree with that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2533.36s)]
*  And definitely what he did to Vicente Luque was masterful. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2534.8s)]
*  And I was telling a lot of guys, watch out for that because just how Vicente Luque, he [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2538.0s)]
*  strikes. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2543.0s)]
*  And he's a powerful guy. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2544.0s)]
*  I don't get it twisted. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2545.0s)]
*  A lot of knockouts. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2546.0s)]
*  He's straight up. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2547.08s)]
*  Takes a lot of damage. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2548.08s)]
*  Takes a lot of punishment. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2549.08s)]
*  But if you've got somebody who's got decent footwork, good combinations that they put [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2550.08s)]
*  together, which Jeff Neil does have, you've seen like, just pick them apart. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2552.32s)]
*  Just with boxing alone. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2556.52s)]
*  And a lot of those guys with those Dutch styles, I feel like, man, they just be getting touched [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2558.68s)]
*  too much. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2562.44s)]
*  It's a hard style. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2563.44s)]
*  It's a hard style. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2564.44s)]
*  I mean, you could deliver some bangers, but that's somebody standing right in front of [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2565.44s)]
*  you. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2568.4s)]
*  And Jeff Neil wasn't doing that for him. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2569.4s)]
*  Yeah, he masterfully moved around and picked his shots. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2570.4s)]
*  That was big. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2574.48s)]
*  The division is wild. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2575.96s)]
*  Like, all divisions are wild right now in the UFC, but I feel like 170 in particular. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2576.96s)]
*  And I feel like the only thing that's missing from 170 is the personality part. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2581.76s)]
*  You got the Kobe Covington, and now we got, well, Kevin Hollen as a 170 fighter. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2585.44s)]
*  But a lot of these guys, I don't feel like promote themselves. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2590.2s)]
*  Even Vicente Luque, what is his nickname? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2592.6s)]
*  The silent assassin. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2594.68s)]
*  He don't talk much. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2595.68s)]
*  He doesn't do anything. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2596.68s)]
*  Gilbert Burns is one of them, you know what I mean? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2597.68s)]
*  That don't really promote himself like that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2600.44s)]
*  Jeff Neil don't really promote himself like that. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2601.8s)]
*  But they all talented, but you don't have a lot of personality that goes within fighting, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2604.0s)]
*  that people want to actually attach themselves and want to watch you fight. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2608.92s)]
*  And that's where I feel like the 170 division is missing. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2612.16s)]
*  Well, Masvidal, Masvidal's over running. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2615.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2618.08s)]
*  Masvidal, what, number 11 in the world now? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2619.08s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2621.2s)]
*  He eating. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2622.2s)]
*  But I feel like Masvidal, even though he a personality, he a journeyman, man. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2623.2s)]
*  I ain't trying to be, you know, it is what it is. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2628.32s)]
*  Masvidal's still dangerous as fuck. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2630.48s)]
*  Boy, I take that fight. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2632.64s)]
*  If I can get that fight, I'll love that fight. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2633.64s)]
*  You might be able to get that fight. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2635.56s)]
*  I mean, you think so, Joe? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2636.72s)]
*  I might not. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2638.08s)]
*  I mean, I'm on your show. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2639.08s)]
*  You win with Chris Curtis? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2640.08s)]
*  It ain't no if. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2641.08s)]
*  I'm going to knock that fool out. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2642.08s)]
*  Chris Curtis is a bad motherfucker. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2643.08s)]
*  He is, bro. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2644.08s)]
*  He is. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2645.08s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2646.08s)]
*  That's a really good fight for you, too. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2647.08s)]
*  My thing is, it's a great fight for me, but you can't stand right in front of that man. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2648.08s)]
*  So when he fought Phil Hawes, right? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2650.64s)]
*  Phil Hawes was beating his ass. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2653.12s)]
*  You know, putting the jab on him, you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2654.8s)]
*  Hit across, like level changing, you know, on him. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the thing about Chris Curtis. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2660.0s)]
*  He's able to just shrug off a couple of those shots, you know what I mean? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2661.6000000000004s)]
*  And just be patient and just wait. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2664.6000000000004s)]
*  But when Phil Hawes got comfortable and just like, you know, felt like he just flowing, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2666.52s)]
*  that's when he got caught. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2670.2000000000003s)]
*  Boom. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2671.2000000000003s)]
*  And took that one shot and then it was over with. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2672.2000000000003s)]
*  Chris Curtis is one of those never say die guys. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2673.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2677.2400000000002s)]
*  He's always there. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2678.2400000000002s)]
*  He's always there. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2679.2400000000002s)]
*  But I love it stylistically with you because if your style of fighting, you tell yourself, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2680.32s)]
*  in your last fight, even though you lost that third round, you showed why people love you. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2685.04s)]
*  You came out guns blazing. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2690.92s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2692.92s)]
*  Well, I went into that fight with the wrong mentality. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2693.92s)]
*  The same way I came out in the third, I should have came out in the first and second because [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  I was hoping and I was praying because I was, you know, nitpicking on a lot of stuff. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2700.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2704.52s)]
*  I was just talking about where you're from, you know, being Russian, but now being a Frenchman. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2705.52s)]
*  So like you ain't got a real home at the end of the day and people love me more than you [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2708.24s)]
*  out here in Paris and I'm getting more love and they don't even know who you are. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  Like just little things like I was talking about like eating up Nassadine cuisine, like [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2716.52s)]
*  just like just picking on him the whole time. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2720.56s)]
*  But regardless though, like that first round, I was hoping that he was going to engage a [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2723.04s)]
*  little bit more. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2726.2799999999997s)]
*  But because of that size and because of that length that these guys have, you know, they [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2727.52s)]
*  will only fight me at bay, you know, which is smart family. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  Intelligent, right? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2734.24s)]
*  Why try to expose yourself and then the pressure too hard where I can catch you, you know, but [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  I was hoping that he would come in with a little bit more emotion, you know, but he [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2739.8399999999997s)]
*  didn't. He kept poised. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2743.2s)]
*  So you were fucking with him hoping that he would get out of character. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2744.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, man. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2747.2s)]
*  But, you know, he did his job, you know, but at the end of the day when coach said, you [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2748.2s)]
*  know what I'm saying, we definitely losing. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  We had to pick that shit up in the third round. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2752.96s)]
*  I said, say less. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2754.72s)]
*  So I was like willing to get knocked out in order to go knock him out. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2755.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2758.12s)]
*  That's the only difference. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2759.12s)]
*  That third round, you emptied the gas tank. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2760.12s)]
*  I had to. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2761.4399999999996s)]
*  That was impressive. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2762.4399999999996s)]
*  I had to. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2763.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2764.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm surprised he survived that knee. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2765.4399999999996s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2766.4399999999996s)]
*  That knee that I hit on him. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2767.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's why I'm thinking like, bro, maybe fighting at my more appropriate weight class, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2768.4399999999996s)]
*  you know, it's like George St. Pierre, like, you know, moving up to 185, but he never stayed [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2772.2s)]
*  there because at the end of the day, he already knew that these guys would be big. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2776.64s)]
*  Even if he's better as a fighter, these athletes are just different now. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2779.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2782.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2783.7999999999997s)]
*  And anything that you giving up, whether it's size, length, strength, like these all play [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2784.7999999999997s)]
*  a part, you know, when you're messing with some of the best people in the world. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2787.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2791.2s)]
*  Most certainly, I think 170 is a much better weight class for you. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2792.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2794.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2795.7999999999997s)]
*  In every way. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2796.7999999999997s)]
*  And especially if you're really walking around at 181 sometimes. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2797.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2799.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's what I was. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2800.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, I accidentally cut down because I was just trying, I was just chilling, like, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2801.68s)]
*  you know, and I was eating whatever I wanted in Paris. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2804.16s)]
*  Like I was enjoying my whole time there, you know, so I was eating before weighting. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2806.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2810.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2811.64s)]
*  Fighters can't say that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2812.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2813.64s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2814.64s)]
*  I was at the restaurant. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2815.64s)]
*  Restaurant. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2816.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2817.64s)]
*  Just chilling. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2818.64s)]
*  And my biggest thing is just like, I'm not afraid to fight guys that's bigger, you know? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2819.64s)]
*  I know that I'm giving up some type of, you know, advantage for them because of the attributes [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2825.44s)]
*  and stuff, but at the same time, like my mentality is that I'm willing to fight and brawl with [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2830.52s)]
*  anybody that stands in front of me. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2835.16s)]
*  You know, because when I started off with MMA, that's all I used to work with was bigger [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2837.28s)]
*  guys. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2840.32s)]
*  And sometimes I was like, oh man, I can actually take the advantage because I'm faster and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2841.32s)]
*  my footwork is there. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2844.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2845.36s)]
*  Or I'm just better and, or skill set wise, you know, because you already know, like the [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2846.36s)]
*  heavier the weight class, you know, the less skills. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2850.2s)]
*  Smaller weight class, the more skills. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2853.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2854.76s)]
*  Fly weight division got some of the best fighters in the world. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2855.76s)]
*  I think that's the case in the like 170s and 185s because I don't think that's the case. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2857.28s)]
*  I mean, well, I mean, structurally when you see, uh, maybe even at 185, you still got [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2862.48s)]
*  a lot of guys that's not that good, but they just powerful. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2869.1200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2872.0400000000004s)]
*  But I would just put it a great example. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2873.0400000000004s)]
*  You see a lot more strikers in the 185 division, but in 170, what do you see more grapplers? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2874.5600000000004s)]
*  And at the end of the day, in my, in my humble opinion, MMA is still structured for grappling. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2881.1200000000003s)]
*  It's still structured for Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, judo, all that stuff, because at the end of [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2886.04s)]
*  the day, you got to grab, you got to clench. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2889.92s)]
*  So I feel like the grappler, the better grappler is always going to win in MMA. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  That's just my opinion. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2896.04s)]
*  It's most of the time. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2897.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's most of the time. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2898.04s)]
*  Not every time, but like Leon Edwards and Kamaru Usman. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2899.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's barely. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2902.04s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2903.04s)]
*  That was many later. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2904.04s)]
*  Barely. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2905.04s)]
*  Barely. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2906.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2907.04s)]
*  But still, it doesn't, barely doesn't mean anything when you win the world title by head [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2908.04s)]
*  kick knockout. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2910.24s)]
*  It's like Ben Ashton versus, uh, Jorge Malsudal. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2911.24s)]
*  It's a great situation where a flying knee you pop them with, but if they fought again, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2914.48s)]
*  that probably would never happen. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2918.92s)]
*  I think there's a bunch of factors there. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2921.36s)]
*  First of all, you're dealing with a Ben Askren that, Ben Askren, this is all common knowledge [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2923.6s)]
*  now. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2928.16s)]
*  He had a fucked up hip by the time he got to the UFC. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2929.16s)]
*  Big fact, big fact. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2930.16s)]
*  He was already blown out. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2931.16s)]
*  Came in too late. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2932.16s)]
*  Yeah, he came in too late. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2933.16s)]
*  But you seen him with Douglas Lima, Andre, you know, like, like when he fought those [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2934.16s)]
*  guys, you know what I mean? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2937.36s)]
*  And those are great MMA fighters. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2938.36s)]
*  Like Andre, I forget his last name. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2939.36s)]
*  Kershkov. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2940.8s)]
*  Kershkov, like, but he destroyed them dudes. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2941.8s)]
*  Yeah, ragdoll. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2943.28s)]
*  We're just wrestling alone. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2945.0800000000004s)]
*  Habib is a great example to me again, because shout out to Michael Johnson, right? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2946.0800000000004s)]
*  From St. Louis. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2950.36s)]
*  You know, he actually went to the same high school too as well. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2951.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2953.6400000000003s)]
*  We got a little crazy story with that. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2954.6400000000003s)]
*  But, um, you know, he was the only person to really hurt Habib because he had an actual [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2955.6400000000003s)]
*  opportunity to beat Habib, right? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2959.92s)]
*  But Habib said, what? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2962.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna take you down and keep you down. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2963.1600000000003s)]
*  So I feel like the majority of grapplers is always going to, or the better grapplers is [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2966.0400000000004s)]
*  always going to beat the better striker. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2968.92s)]
*  I think it's the most important skill in MMA. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2970.4s)]
*  Because the grappler has the ability to dictate whether the fight stays up or goes to the [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2972.92s)]
*  ground. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2976.96s)]
*  That's why when a guy like Bo Nicol gets into the MMA world, everybody's like, oh shit. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2977.96s)]
*  Because it's just such an accelerated wrestler. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2982.6s)]
*  But at the same time, it still levels to it, right? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2984.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2986.76s)]
*  Because Aaron Pico, I think is a great example because they rushed him too fast. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2987.76s)]
*  Because he actually fought a dude named Zach Freeman who's from Missouri as well. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2991.96s)]
*  And experienced dudes. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2996.08s)]
*  You know, Zach Freeman was like the most talented but hardworking dude. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=2997.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3000.68s)]
*  And he was a vet. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3001.68s)]
*  So he had multiple fights in the game. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3002.68s)]
*  And then Aaron Pico, even though he's a what? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3003.68s)]
*  Olympic wrestler or something like that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3005.88s)]
*  And then, you know, golden gloves, boxing, all this stuff, which is cool. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3007.48s)]
*  He didn't have the experience in the MMA cage, which is a little bit different. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3010.44s)]
*  And I feel like if you don't develop these guys' skills and experience first, they can [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3014.48s)]
*  get caught. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3018.08s)]
*  Even though they got all the skill sets in the world, they still just gonna get caught [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3019.2799999999997s)]
*  by somebody that's already been on that level. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3022.2799999999997s)]
*  Did you see Aaron's last fight where he blew out his shoulder? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3024.96s)]
*  Well, he blew out his shoulder? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3027.16s)]
*  No, I didn't see it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3028.56s)]
*  Yeah, he had the same thing that happened with TJ. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3029.56s)]
*  He dislocated his shoulder and then had to stop the fight. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3031.56s)]
*  He threw a left hook and it just popped out. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3034.56s)]
*  It just popped out. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3036.76s)]
*  Now I'd be wondering what these little injuries be coming from like that, you know? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3037.76s)]
*  Well, some of these wrestlers, their shoulders are so fucked. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3040.96s)]
*  By the time they get into MMA, they have all these tears and shit and they're kind of barely [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3043.56s)]
*  holding on anyway. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3047.76s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3048.76s)]
*  But that's the thing though, because it might be happening in training. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3049.76s)]
*  So if it's happening in training, you gotta do something to keep it or prevent it from [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3053.32s)]
*  happening. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3057.52s)]
*  Because he was staying active then, right? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3058.52s)]
*  Aaron Pico? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3060.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3061.52s)]
*  So here it is, they're trying to pull it out. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3062.52s)]
*  Oh, they in the corner doing it? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3065.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3067.52s)]
*  Look, they were trying to pull it out. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3068.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3069.52s)]
*  There's like a technique to pulling someone's shoulder when it gets out of stock. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3070.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3073.52s)]
*  Ain't no technique today. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3074.52s)]
*  He's just pulling that thing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3075.52s)]
*  I don't think that's how it goes. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3076.52s)]
*  He's trying to pull his arm off. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3077.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's how it goes. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3078.52s)]
*  I think there's a way to do it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3081.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't necessarily think this guy is doing it correctly. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3082.84s)]
*  He's trying. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3085.76s)]
*  He's trying. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3086.76s)]
*  Isn't there a way? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3087.76s)]
*  Isn't there a way he's supposed to do it? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3088.76s)]
*  You can definitely look it up. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3090.76s)]
*  Like Mel Gibson slamming his shoulder in the wall. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3091.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3093.76s)]
*  Eat the weapon. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3094.76s)]
*  That's not the right way to take this off. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3095.76s)]
*  But it's a common thing where guys blow their shoulders out. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3097.1200000000003s)]
*  Have you had any surgeries or any major injuries? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3101.48s)]
*  Yeah, the only time I had surgeries was when I got into the USC. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3103.96s)]
*  I had no injuries throughout the fight until I started fighting on the best promotion on [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3107.36s)]
*  the planet, which I'm fighting the best fighters. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3111.48s)]
*  What injury did you get? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3114.0s)]
*  ACL tear, meniscus tear. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3115.0s)]
*  So meniscus, as well as the orbital fracture in the Antonio Arroyo fight. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3118.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was bad because I was seeing two of him. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3124.3199999999997s)]
*  I was coming off a loss of Alessio. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3127.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's who tore my meniscus when he had kicked me with that roundhouse kick because [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3130.16s)]
*  I was ducking. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3133.68s)]
*  I was trying to box too much. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3134.68s)]
*  It kicked me outside my head. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3135.68s)]
*  But the way I fell, I ended up tearing my meniscus. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3137.2s)]
*  After that fight that I had with him, getting that surgery, I went into the fight with Antonio [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3140.96s)]
*  Arroyo. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3145.2799999999997s)]
*  I won that fight, but he left a good little mark right underneath my eye, but I found [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3146.2799999999997s)]
*  out that he had broke my orbital. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3150.4s)]
*  So did you have to get surgery in your orbital? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3152.24s)]
*  Yeah, so they had to replace it with a little rod. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3153.7999999999997s)]
*  The base of my eye itself, it was gone, so my eye was just floating there. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3157.56s)]
*  So I could have had a lazy eye. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3164.24s)]
*  So they was like, yeah, we got to replace this so you can have that wall back underneath [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3165.56s)]
*  that foundation almost. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3169.42s)]
*  Can you feel it when you touch your face? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3171.7400000000002s)]
*  No, I can't feel it. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3172.7400000000002s)]
*  I can feel it a little bit, like the soft part that you have here. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3173.7400000000002s)]
*  So I can feel right here where it's a little harder. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3177.46s)]
*  And they said if it was metal, then I couldn't be able to compete, so they put a plastic [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3180.66s)]
*  one. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3183.66s)]
*  And I was asking, is that going to affect it? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3184.66s)]
*  Is it easier to break? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3185.66s)]
*  And they were like, no, it's hard to reach type shit. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3186.66s)]
*  Actually makes it a lot stronger because the bone is so fragile. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3190.06s)]
*  So if it was metal, you wouldn't be able to fight because it would open up with cuts or [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3193.1s)]
*  something? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3195.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3196.98s)]
*  That's what they said. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3197.98s)]
*  So you wouldn't be able to compete. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3199.54s)]
*  I think that was coming from the UFC had hit him up and told them that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3200.54s)]
*  Don't quote me, but that's what I heard the doctor tell him. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3204.26s)]
*  Oh, maybe it's just in the face. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3208.38s)]
*  Did you see, who's that dude who fought Canelo, Billy Joe Saunders, where he got his whole [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3212.1s)]
*  face caved in? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3217.94s)]
*  Cheek bone. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3219.3s)]
*  Everything. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3220.3s)]
*  It was like up here, here. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3221.3s)]
*  Which one you think is worse, that one or the Sage Northcutt? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3222.3s)]
*  When he got his... [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3225.98s)]
*  Oh, Sage was a bad one. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3226.98s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3227.98s)]
*  And then you got who else got their face caved in. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3228.98s)]
*  And it's sad because it's multiple sideboard with MVP. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3231.98s)]
*  That was probably the worst ever. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3236.46s)]
*  The skull. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3238.26s)]
*  Caved his forehead in. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3239.26s)]
*  That's scary because this is supposed to be the hardest part of your hit. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3240.26s)]
*  The hardest part where everybody breaks their hands. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3242.7400000000002s)]
*  And they caved in like you got hit with a missile. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3245.62s)]
*  Man, that was nasty. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3248.02s)]
*  That was the wildest flying knee. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3249.62s)]
*  Michael Vennum Page is a bad motherfucker, dude. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3251.34s)]
*  He's so wild. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3253.54s)]
*  I remember I went to fight him when I was in Bellatoria just to get my name out there [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3255.1s)]
*  for real, for real. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3257.66s)]
*  But I just wanted to challenge myself against somebody like that because he had that style [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3258.66s)]
*  of traditional martial arts. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3262.46s)]
*  Point fighting. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3265.22s)]
*  Like point fighting. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3266.22s)]
*  But he was really knocking dudes out though. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3267.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3269.34s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3270.34s)]
*  That's the fracture. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3271.34s)]
*  This is sideboard. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3272.34s)]
*  Look at all the plates he has in his fucking hand. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3273.34s)]
*  That was it for him, man. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3276.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's over with. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3277.18s)]
*  He said he was going to keep fighting after that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3279.18s)]
*  And the doctor was like, no. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3280.7799999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, you can't, big fella. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3281.7799999999997s)]
*  Play that again. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3285.2200000000003s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  And like you can hear it too. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3287.2200000000003s)]
*  Like if you can play something that nasty when you hear the pop. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3289.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, like you just heard it break. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3293.02s)]
*  Just heard it cave in. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3296.02s)]
*  And a dude as tough as sideboard, seeing him writhing in pain like that. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3297.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, boy, you would have seen me kicking my leg, boy. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3301.5s)]
*  I would have been like out there swimming. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3303.5s)]
*  And then look at MVP like the fucking Pokemon. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3306.5s)]
*  Like he even caught Pikachu or something. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3309.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3312.5s)]
*  He's a showman for sure, but he got his ass whooped by Mike Perry though. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3313.62s)]
*  Yeah, that was wild. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3316.62s)]
*  And that bare knuckle boxing. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3317.62s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3318.62s)]
*  That's a whole different type of style of fight. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3319.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3321.62s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3322.62s)]
*  You thinking because you got gloves on or you take the gloves off and it's still going [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3323.62s)]
*  to be a type of fight, but bro, that's bone on bone. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3327.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3329.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3330.62s)]
*  And that takes a different type of beast to fight, bare knuckle boxing. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3331.62s)]
*  Well, Mike Perry is designed for that shit. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3333.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, he was made for that. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3336.06s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3337.06s)]
*  Big thanks, man. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3338.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3339.06s)]
*  I've always thought it's kind of weird that the elbows aren't covered by a pad, your shins [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3340.62s)]
*  aren't covered by a pad, your foot's not covered by a pad, your heel's not covered by a pad. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3344.46s)]
*  They did it old school. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3349.42s)]
*  Y'all got to start right in front of each other and just get the bang. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3350.42s)]
*  I mean, I like bare knuckle boxing. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3353.42s)]
*  Very interesting, but not for me. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3356.42s)]
*  No. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3357.42s)]
*  Definitely not for me, man. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3358.42s)]
*  Even if you come with a big check? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3359.42s)]
*  Nah. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3361.42s)]
*  Nah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3362.42s)]
*  A little bit of hesitation. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3363.42s)]
*  I mean, because I'm thinking about that check. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3364.42s)]
*  But at the same time, though, it's just like, man, your health is everything. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3366.78s)]
*  And people come out looking different with bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3370.78s)]
*  Polymulanaji versus Artem, that shit was crazy. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3373.78s)]
*  Page Bang Gant, like, come on, you get rid of your money. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3377.78s)]
*  You a pretty ass girl. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3382.78s)]
*  You don't need to be in bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3383.78s)]
*  Chris Liebman, he fought in bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3385.98s)]
*  It looked like he got hit with a hatchet. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3388.1800000000003s)]
*  His whole face was busted. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3390.38s)]
*  Nasty, man. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3391.38s)]
*  And then you just get cut up because of the knuckles. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3392.38s)]
*  So you just got all these little splits down here. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3394.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sorry, bro. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3396.34s)]
*  Just too much. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3397.34s)]
*  But do you think that it's, like, is there an argument for doing that at MMA for eliminating [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3398.34s)]
*  gloves? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3404.1800000000003s)]
*  Because if you don't have pads on your knees and your shins and your elbows and all the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3405.1800000000003s)]
*  other weapons that you hit people with, why do you have pads on your knuckles? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3409.9s)]
*  Well, that's good, but it's the break of the hand. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3413.46s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3417.9s)]
*  Right, but doesn't that make it unrealistic to be able to just wildly punch people? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3418.9s)]
*  I didn't know they were trying to make it realistic. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3421.5s)]
*  I thought they were trying to make it a sport. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3422.62s)]
*  It is a sport, but it's a sport of fighting. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3424.62s)]
*  And if you have no padding on all these other areas. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3426.62s)]
*  So here, let me show you King of the Streets. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3429.38s)]
*  This is real fighting right here. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3431.14s)]
*  So it's KOTS, King of the Streets. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3432.22s)]
*  Who was fighting? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3436.34s)]
*  No, no, I don't know the names of these fighters. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3437.34s)]
*  I'm just about to show you this. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3441.18s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3442.18s)]
*  It's a promotion. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3443.18s)]
*  It's a promotion. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3444.18s)]
*  This is real fighting at its element, you know what I mean? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3445.18s)]
*  Because they fight outside. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3447.06s)]
*  They fight in a warehouse. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3449.2200000000003s)]
*  And as well, they don't have any bare knuckle, like nothing. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3450.7000000000003s)]
*  This is King of the Streets. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3454.42s)]
*  This is real fighting. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3455.42s)]
*  This is what UFC can't do this. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3456.42s)]
*  Underground Fight Club. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3457.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3458.42s)]
*  Look, everybody got a face mask, everything like that, because they don't want to get [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3459.42s)]
*  exposed out here just in case a murder happen. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3462.06s)]
*  Is that a mat? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3465.1s)]
*  Like, what are they fighting on? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3466.1s)]
*  They're not fighting on a mat. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3467.1s)]
*  That's concrete. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3468.1s)]
*  That's cement. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3469.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3470.1s)]
*  That is cement, yes sir. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3471.1s)]
*  And they actually pretty popular right now. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3472.3s)]
*  With sneakers on. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3475.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's a real fight. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3476.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3477.6600000000003s)]
*  But bro, you get KO'd and you fall back. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3479.46s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3481.98s)]
*  And they got many. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3482.98s)]
*  They got many KO's. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3483.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3484.98s)]
*  If you get body slammed on concrete, that is fucking bad. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3485.98s)]
*  So one dude got rocked with a left hook, right? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3488.42s)]
*  Fell down and as he fell down, the dude kicked him right in his face. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3491.2599999999998s)]
*  And like, my man just seizes out. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3494.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3495.7s)]
*  Now this is brutal. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3496.7s)]
*  But this is the closest thing that you get to a real fight because this is a real fight. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3497.7s)]
*  It's a real fight and the only thing that's covered is they're wearing sneakers. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3501.66s)]
*  Why are they wearing sneakers though? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3504.74s)]
*  I feel like you shouldn't wear. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3506.46s)]
*  First of all, you shouldn't be wearing running shoes. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3508.34s)]
*  Oh, this dude is just getting piled right. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3510.1000000000004s)]
*  So you take your shoes off, Joe, before a fight? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3512.02s)]
*  No, I wouldn't. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3515.1000000000004s)]
*  But I wouldn't wear those. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3517.26s)]
*  You said you wouldn't. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3518.26s)]
*  I wouldn't wear those shoes. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3519.26s)]
*  I would wear wrestling shoes. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3520.26s)]
*  You wouldn't wear them? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3521.26s)]
*  Skechers, Nanna, Medidas? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3522.26s)]
*  I would wear wrestling shoes. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3523.26s)]
*  Wrestling shoes are lighter. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3524.26s)]
*  If you have cushioning under your sole, that cushioning is making you unstable. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3526.9s)]
*  It's making you move. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3532.1800000000003s)]
*  Like if you have running shoes on and you're going side to side, you're not fully planted [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3533.1800000000003s)]
*  on the ground like you are if you have wrestling shoes on. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3537.86s)]
*  Wrestling shoes would be the way to go. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3540.7400000000002s)]
*  Big facts. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3542.02s)]
*  But in a real scenario, you would never have wrestling shoes on. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3543.02s)]
*  And then you ain't going to pause and somebody's like, hey, wait, wait, wait. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3546.2200000000003s)]
*  Let me put these wrestling shoes on. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3548.02s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3549.02s)]
*  Because I done been in street fights. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3550.02s)]
*  I done known the element. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3551.02s)]
*  I used to work security in St. Louis and I worked security for like eight years, bro. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3552.02s)]
*  Two damn long. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3555.46s)]
*  But the only reason why I worked security, man, because it was so fun. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3556.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3559.42s)]
*  There's so many different stories there. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3560.42s)]
*  There's so many different things that's going on. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3561.42s)]
*  Just being out there in that environment and just regular life ain't nothing going on for [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3563.82s)]
*  real. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3569.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3570.02s)]
*  Just having a regular-ass job. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3571.02s)]
*  And I'm fighting still and I'm just training. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3572.02s)]
*  But this is where the fun part of it, the nightlife, you know what I'm saying? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3573.6600000000003s)]
*  Almost being like I said, the John Jones. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3577.7000000000003s)]
*  So I'm glad I didn't get signed early in my career because I would have had a bunch of [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3578.7000000000003s)]
*  little crazy stories to tell. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3581.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3582.9s)]
*  No, for real, for real. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3583.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3584.9s)]
*  But luckily I was able to mature over time. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3585.9s)]
*  But regardless though, I done seen the street element where a lot of guys think because they [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3586.9s)]
*  trained Jiu Jitsu, because they train boxing, they train MMA, that they going to be good [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3591.54s)]
*  fighting in the streets. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3596.22s)]
*  But there ain't no rules, bro. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3597.22s)]
*  I done seen dudes be calmly like, oh man, I don't want to fight you because you doodoo [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3598.22s)]
*  doo. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3601.3s)]
*  And I got a beer in their hand and they smash their head in. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3602.3s)]
*  Immediately. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3603.3s)]
*  But they not even seeing just the body language, right? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3604.3s)]
*  You're not paying attention to certain stuff. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3607.06s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of guys that train the discipline, which is nothing wrong with training [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3609.46s)]
*  the discipline, but they use that alone to think that's going to save them. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3613.14s)]
*  You got to actually have the mentality that you are going to end a threat at any given [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3618.26s)]
*  moment by using anything that is necessary at that time. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3622.34s)]
*  And a lot of guys don't do that because I seen guys on the floor thinking it's a Jiu [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3626.5800000000004s)]
*  Jitsu match, but it gets stomped out. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3629.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3631.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3632.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3633.46s)]
*  It's different things like that. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3634.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3635.46s)]
*  So I feel like people be having the wrong idea when it comes to Jiu Jitsu, wrestling, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3636.46s)]
*  MMA. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3640.1400000000003s)]
*  That ain't the core element of fighting itself. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3641.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, if you're fighting like those guys are on concrete, that is a whole different ball [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3643.38s)]
*  game. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3647.1000000000004s)]
*  Especially with takedowns. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3648.94s)]
*  That's a real fight though. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3649.94s)]
*  And like I said, I never do nothing like that. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3650.94s)]
*  That's for no amount of money. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3652.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3653.94s)]
*  I bet they're not getting paid very well either. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3654.94s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3655.94s)]
*  They just going viral. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3656.94s)]
*  That's it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3657.94s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3658.94s)]
*  They just going viral. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3659.94s)]
*  But besides that though, but I do respect it because at the end of the day, that is [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3660.94s)]
*  real fighting. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3665.5s)]
*  Oh, it's real. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3666.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3667.5s)]
*  Period. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3668.5s)]
*  Especially on concrete. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3669.5s)]
*  If you're on concrete and you're fighting a wrestler, you're in deep shit. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3670.5s)]
*  You're in deep shit. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3674.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3675.3399999999997s)]
*  I didn't see wrestlers getting knocked out though. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3676.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, that happens too. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3677.58s)]
*  Come on now. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3678.58s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3679.58s)]
*  They thinking just double-leg yourself, but dude pulling your hair. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3680.58s)]
*  That's true too. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3683.78s)]
*  Adding stuff to it. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3684.78s)]
*  Like, you know, headbutton. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3685.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3686.78s)]
*  If you're only a wrestler, yeah. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3687.78s)]
*  Big facts. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3688.78s)]
*  Because you thinking like your actual form of wrestling trying to ... You get in a wrestling [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3689.78s)]
*  stance, like come on man. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3693.1400000000003s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3694.1400000000003s)]
*  But I didn't seen it before. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3695.1400000000003s)]
*  Where people actually pick a stance to get in, that's not real fighting. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3696.94s)]
*  You don't even show that threat. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3700.9s)]
*  You just make the move. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3702.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3703.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3704.44s)]
*  And like I said, you eliminate the threat as fast as possible. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3705.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3706.54s)]
*  Shout out to the Detroit Dust. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3707.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3708.54s)]
*  Dale Brown. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3709.54s)]
*  But he speaks about it as well because it's just like you want to be in the most calm [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3710.54s)]
*  position as possible if you ... Amongst somebody that's trying to fight you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3714.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3718.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, if you know this is about to go there, you shouldn't show that you want to fight [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3719.2000000000003s)]
*  them. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3722.88s)]
*  You should actually be more calm and be more whatever. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3723.88s)]
*  And then once they actually make that move, that's when you counter whatever and hit whatever [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3726.84s)]
*  part of the body that you can. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3731.16s)]
*  But just be aware. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3732.16s)]
*  Always be aware. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3733.16s)]
*  Always be aware. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3734.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3735.16s)]
*  So, you're saying that now that you're known and you become a famous fighter, do people [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3736.8799999999997s)]
*  fuck with you now? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3740.08s)]
*  I ain't never been really fucked with now. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3741.44s)]
*  For real. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3743.44s)]
*  I ain't never just had no type of problems like that. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3744.44s)]
*  But you're a nice guy though. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3746.52s)]
*  That's also part of it. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3749.44s)]
*  The way you carry yourself. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3750.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3751.44s)]
*  I walk with respect everywhere I go. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3752.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3753.44s)]
*  So, I never be out of pocket. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3754.44s)]
*  Never be out of line. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3755.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3756.7999999999997s)]
*  So, I never add any situation where anybody will want to fight me. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3757.7999999999997s)]
*  Me working security, I guess I had opportunities where I could have jacked up a lot of guys. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3763.0s)]
*  When I was younger, I was definitely effing up a lot of guys, but that's not the security [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  job to do. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3770.4s)]
*  You're supposed to de-escalate a lot of situations. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3771.4s)]
*  But you had a lot of guys that would try to press your patience. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3773.48s)]
*  And I could have popped one, but just keep it cool. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3777.68s)]
*  Keep it calm. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3779.88s)]
*  And try to get people out the smartest way possible. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3780.88s)]
*  Like, hey bro, let me holler at you outside real quick. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3783.24s)]
*  But then kick them out. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3786.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3787.48s)]
*  Act like I'm trying to have a conversation with you. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3788.48s)]
*  Hey man, let me see. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3790.08s)]
*  You got something on your wrist, man? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3791.08s)]
*  Break it off. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3792.7999999999997s)]
*  And then they gotta leave. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3793.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3794.7999999999997s)]
*  But you do have scenarios for myself, like when I was working security, where guys will [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3795.7999999999997s)]
*  try to challenge you. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3799.64s)]
*  And try to buck up and stuff like that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3801.48s)]
*  Where you do have to do something. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3802.92s)]
*  But at the end of the day, don't nobody really try nothing. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3804.36s)]
*  You know, they lose. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3806.92s)]
*  I'm undefeated in these streets. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3807.92s)]
*  I'm glad you're out of that situation now. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3808.92s)]
*  That's a dangerous game to play. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3811.92s)]
*  And I've been playing it for a long time. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3813.92s)]
*  And that's why I say it ain't scary getting into that cage. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3815.72s)]
*  That does play a factor. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3819.08s)]
*  Guys have been in street fights, and a lot of them. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3820.6400000000003s)]
*  It's calmer in the cage. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3823.32s)]
*  Way more calmer. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3825.4s)]
*  Because it's the actual competition. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3826.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3828.28s)]
*  I got somebody right here on the side of me, which is called a referee, that if anything [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3830.1600000000003s)]
*  does happen, he gon' stop the fight. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3834.08s)]
*  You don't got that in the street element. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3836.6800000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3837.92s)]
*  Because once you get knocked out, I done seen dudes where they get KO'd and dude keep pummeling. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3838.92s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3842.36s)]
*  And not stopping. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3843.36s)]
*  Like, bro, you gon' do some life, bro. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3844.36s)]
*  Like, bro, you gon' do some life, bro. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3845.84s)]
*  Like, you killed this dude. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3848.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3849.36s)]
*  And that's why people die. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3850.36s)]
*  All the time. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3851.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3852.36s)]
*  And regardless though, but those scenarios and dealing with that type of stuff, like [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3853.36s)]
*  I said, I feel like I'm at home when I'm in that octagon. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3857.28s)]
*  Because this is where I feel like I'm free and then I can express myself freely without [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3860.96s)]
*  actually being judged for doing what I'm doing. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3864.36s)]
*  So that's why I love fighting in the UFC right now. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3867.36s)]
*  Now, when you look at your career going forward, you've got this Chris Curtis fight, you plan [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3870.52s)]
*  on winning that fight, and then you want to drop down to 170. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3876.4s)]
*  No, I am. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3880.44s)]
*  Point blank. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3881.44s)]
*  I was already planning on moving down to 170, but what my manager told me, I ain't trying [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3882.44s)]
*  to put his stuff out there like that. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3886.44s)]
*  I'm signing with Sucker Punch, Brian Butler, but he was telling me I can get a better contract [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3888.44s)]
*  if I sign one more fight at 185. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3892.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3894.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3895.44s)]
*  So the UFC offered you this fight. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3896.44s)]
*  They want to make an exciting fight for this big card in Vegas. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3897.64s)]
*  Big fight. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3899.44s)]
*  Big fight. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3900.44s)]
*  That's a great card. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3901.44s)]
*  And they love it, right? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3902.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3903.44s)]
*  Because it's not one fight that the UFC gave me that I did not. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3904.44s)]
*  I didn't took every fight. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3906.44s)]
*  I was even supposed to fight Alex Pereira, fam. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3907.44s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3909.44s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3910.44s)]
*  So I had to reside out a Hassan fight. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3911.44s)]
*  We were supposed to fight the first card of the year in January. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3913.44s)]
*  He's talking about the shoulder hurt. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3916.44s)]
*  He did something to his shoulder, whatever. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3918.44s)]
*  Blase, blase. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3920.44s)]
*  So I was like, man, forget that, bro. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3921.44s)]
*  I've been training hella hard. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3922.44s)]
*  Just give me anybody. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3923.44s)]
*  So if it ain't reside, because I'm not going to push that fight back. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3924.44s)]
*  I want to fight in January. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3927.44s)]
*  So he was like, all right. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3928.44s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3929.44s)]
*  Let me, uh, Brian was telling me, all right, let me call them back, whatever, and let them [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3930.44s)]
*  know. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3933.44s)]
*  And, uh, they came back with a name. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3934.44s)]
*  And he, like, he was so hesitant to tell me though. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3935.44s)]
*  This is the funny part, right? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3937.44s)]
*  So he was like, oh, man, you know, I don't really like this fight for you, man. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3938.44s)]
*  You know, he's not really well known, but he's pretty good. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3942.44s)]
*  Do do do. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3944.44s)]
*  And I already said it before, before he said it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3945.44s)]
*  I was like, Alex Pereira? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3946.44s)]
*  He said, how do you know? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3947.44s)]
*  And I just already assumed just with my style and who he is, because I always make sure [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3948.44s)]
*  I pay attention to who's on the roster. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3952.44s)]
*  I got to pay attention. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3954.44s)]
*  Even Bo Nickle. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3955.44s)]
*  Even though he's not nowhere yet, that's still a name that people pay attention to and people [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3956.44s)]
*  want to see him do well. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3960.44s)]
*  So I pay attention to fighters like that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3961.44s)]
*  And knowing that Alex Pereira really only got signed because he beat Izzy, I was like, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3962.44s)]
*  that's somebody to pay attention to. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3966.44s)]
*  So when I was able to guess that name, he was like, yeah, that's the, that's the fight [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3968.44s)]
*  they want you to fight. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3970.44s)]
*  Immediately I said yes to it. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3971.44s)]
*  So he calls them back and he calls me back. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3973.44s)]
*  I was like, Hey, I got some good news and I got some bad news. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3975.44s)]
*  I was like, Oh, what's up? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3977.44s)]
*  He said, good news. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3978.44s)]
*  You look great to the UFC, uh, that you taking this fight. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3979.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3982.44s)]
*  But bad news is they say they won't be ready in time. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3983.44s)]
*  And at first I was like, Oh man, this dude being scary. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3985.44s)]
*  But now it makes sense. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3987.44s)]
*  He ain't scary to cut the weight. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3988.44s)]
*  He got so much weight to cut. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3990.44s)]
*  He big. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3992.44s)]
*  So it wasn't that Alex Pereira wouldn't be able to take the fight. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3993.44s)]
*  Cause I think his coach or whoever his training is the one that declined because of the timeframe [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=3996.44s)]
*  wasn't messed up. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4001.44s)]
*  He needs time to cut weight. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4002.44s)]
*  He needs time to cut weight. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4003.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4004.44s)]
*  But I would've, I would've took the fight though, because I already know that he has to cut a [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4005.44s)]
*  lot of weight. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4008.44s)]
*  That dude's walking into the cage like 220. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4009.44s)]
*  Easily. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4011.44s)]
*  Easily. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4012.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4013.44s)]
*  Big power. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4014.44s)]
*  Cause he walking around 240. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4015.44s)]
*  He's got so much power. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4016.44s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that fight this weekend? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4017.44s)]
*  Cause that's a big fight. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4020.44s)]
*  Uh, my thoughts on it bro is way different from everybody else's. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4022.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4025.44s)]
*  Cause people call me crazy all the time, but I think it's going to be like the same fight [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4026.44s)]
*  that we seen Yoel and Izzy with. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4029.44s)]
*  Where you got two people just staring each other down, you know, not trying to make that [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4031.44s)]
*  move because you saw, you know, they both had the capabilities of knocking each other [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4034.44s)]
*  out. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4037.44s)]
*  Or Francis and Gano versus the Derrick Lewis. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4038.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4039.44s)]
*  Uh, so, and with everything, the hype being behind this fight too, you know, the hype [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4040.44s)]
*  behind this fight too, you know, uh, Izzy is going to hopefully, like I said, if he [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4043.44s)]
*  don't apply his emotions into it, like he hasn't done with every other fight, I feel [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4046.44s)]
*  like he's going to do enough to win, but I feel like Alex Pereira is not going to be [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4050.44s)]
*  able to apply that pressure, uh, on, uh, Izzy just because he won't have the energy to sustain [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4054.44s)]
*  that for five rounds. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4059.44s)]
*  Remember this is a five round. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4060.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4061.44s)]
*  Because of the fact that he's cutting so much weight. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4062.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4064.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4065.44s)]
*  And then plus we don't see, uh, Alex Pereira move a lot anyway. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4066.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4067.44s)]
*  In his fights. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4068.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4069.44s)]
*  You only seen with Bruno Silver where he pushed him up against the cage a lot. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4070.44s)]
*  And that was a good fight to watch. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4072.44s)]
*  It was a very good fight to watch. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4073.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4074.44s)]
*  He got hit in that fight. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4075.44s)]
*  Oh, he got touched up real good. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4076.44s)]
*  Bruno Silver's a very good striker. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4077.44s)]
*  Man, big facts, you know, I don't know what to say, but I get what you're saying. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4078.44s)]
*  He got good power. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4081.44s)]
*  He's in your weight class. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4082.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4083.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4084.44s)]
*  I be seeing guys and I be like, this is why they winning these fights. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4085.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4086.44s)]
*  So I know that you're not a boxer. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4087.44s)]
*  I know that you're not a kickboxer, not a heavy striker, cause he's more of a jiu-jitsu, he's [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4088.44s)]
*  more of a grappler. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4091.44s)]
*  But Bruno Silver got good power. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4092.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4093.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4094.44s)]
*  So he able to wing some of the punches, cause a lot of times Bruno Silver be getting his [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4096.4400000000005s)]
*  ass wet. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4099.4400000000005s)]
*  Even Jordan Wright was touching him. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4100.4400000000005s)]
*  Jordan Wright was touching Bruno Silver, but then Jordan Wright just got caught. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4101.4400000000005s)]
*  He stood in front of him. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4104.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly, stood in front of him, got caught. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4105.4400000000005s)]
*  And it don't take that much in the four-ounce clubs. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4106.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's why this Pereira fight is so interesting though, because Pereira has that ridiculous [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4109.4400000000005s)]
*  power. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4114.4400000000005s)]
*  He just need that one shot. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4115.4400000000005s)]
*  But the thing about Izzy, he is patient. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4116.4400000000005s)]
*  And he would, we're not going to call it boring, but he would strategically break you down [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4118.4400000000005s)]
*  all night long for 25 minutes. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4123.44s)]
*  Like the Paul Acosta fight. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4126.44s)]
*  If he got to touch that leg all day, he going to touch it. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4128.44s)]
*  If you ain't going to do nothing about it, if you're not going to answer back, that's [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4131.44s)]
*  what he going to do. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4133.44s)]
*  But I feel like in my heart, you know what I mean, that Alex Pereira unfortunately doesn't [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4134.44s)]
*  have the actual ability to fight Izzy the way he needs to win. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4138.44s)]
*  For five rounds. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4143.44s)]
*  For five rounds. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4144.44s)]
*  Because he's so big. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4145.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the reasons. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4146.44s)]
*  But I just think between both of them, it's going to be a boring fight. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4147.44s)]
*  It's not going to be as exciting as people think it might be. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4149.44s)]
*  And that's the thing, Izzy needs that type of exciting fight right now. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4152.44s)]
*  Because of the Jared Kennedy fight. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4155.44s)]
*  We can say Paul Acosta, but that was so, how long, 2020? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4157.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4161.44s)]
*  So we've been expecting this from the champ because he so pulverized outside the cage [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4162.44s)]
*  with the French tits, the pearl necklace, you know what I mean? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4166.44s)]
*  Doing all these little videos and dancing and all that. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4169.44s)]
*  Just show them and stuff. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4172.44s)]
*  But we want to see that showcased in the cage as well. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4173.44s)]
*  And that's my biggest thing. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4176.44s)]
*  I'm impressed by Izzy and I'm a fan of Izzy first off. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4178.44s)]
*  But I feel like if you don't bring a fight to him, he's not going to bring it to you. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4181.44s)]
*  That make sense? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4186.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4187.44s)]
*  I feel what you're saying. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4188.44s)]
*  Like Anderson Silva in his prime. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4189.44s)]
*  He's willing to dance. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4190.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, big fans. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4191.44s)]
*  I mean people forget that there was quite a few fights where Anderson Silva did the same thing. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4192.44s)]
*  He laid talus latus. Remember that fight? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4196.44s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4198.44s)]
*  You know, there was many fights where he laid back and waited for guys to come at Anderson. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4199.44s)]
*  Even better, there was Damien Maia. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4204.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4206.44s)]
*  And I mean boy, Danny was mad about that one, you hear me? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4207.44s)]
*  But at the same time, that's the way he won. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4209.44s)]
*  Because why would I engage with you knowing what you're trying to do? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4212.44s)]
*  You understand? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4217.44s)]
*  So like I said, with that being said, I'm not mad at Izzy because he's going to do whatever it takes to keep that belt. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4218.44s)]
*  That's the money. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4224.44s)]
*  Alex Pereira wants that. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4225.44s)]
*  But the thing is though, I don't think his ability is going to beat her in order to take it away from him. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4227.44s)]
*  And they're just going to be standing right in front of him and it's going to be a kickboxing bout. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4233.44s)]
*  And they were like, oh, well the other ones were kickboxing. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4236.44s)]
*  But you already seen from Izzy, well, I was a little bit more emotional in those other fights. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4238.44s)]
*  And that's why I lost. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4242.44s)]
*  But then you see the strategic Izzy now. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4243.44s)]
*  I don't see Alex Pereira beating him. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4246.44s)]
*  Interesting. Very interesting. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4249.44s)]
*  Yeah, I take into account what you're saying about the five rounds and the weight cut because that is a big factor. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4251.44s)]
*  That's the hugest factor. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4256.44s)]
*  Because Alex is so big. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4258.44s)]
*  But without the wrestling threat, because Izzy is not really a guy who takes it easy. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4261.44s)]
*  I'm about to say, yeah, who out there wrestling? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4266.44s)]
*  So everybody think like, oh, Izzy going to turn into a wrestler. No, he ain't. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4268.44s)]
*  You only fight the way you train. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4271.44s)]
*  And not saying you don't work on that element of wrestling. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4273.44s)]
*  But I don't see Izzy like shooting a jab, shooting a cross, shooting a hook and double it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4276.44s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4281.44s)]
*  I mean, if it does, I'll be stunned. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4282.44s)]
*  I'll be shocked. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4284.44s)]
*  I'm sure it can do it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4285.44s)]
*  I'll be shocked. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4286.44s)]
*  But the thing is though, now you got to engage with that boy, a sniper. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4287.44s)]
*  Alex Pereira, can we pull up that? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4290.44s)]
*  You don't mind? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4292.44s)]
*  Please. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4293.44s)]
*  Alex Pereira, when he was shooting, like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4294.44s)]
*  Sniping with the arrows. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4297.44s)]
*  Yeah, when he shot the soccer ball. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4298.44s)]
*  That's crazy because my biggest thing is though, like, Alex Pereira is the same type of beast too, right? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4300.44s)]
*  He's the trap. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4306.44s)]
*  He waits all day. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4308.44s)]
*  And once you expose yourself or you come close enough, he hits you. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4310.44s)]
*  Like Shawn Strickland. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4314.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4316.44s)]
*  Shawn Strickland stood right in front of him. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4317.44s)]
*  But it wouldn't even just stand right in front of him. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4319.44s)]
*  He was marching him down with his hands down. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4321.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, he keeps his hands like, he has a very strange style. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4324.44s)]
*  So here's him. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4327.44s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4328.44s)]
*  This was cold. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4329.44s)]
*  It's pretty badass. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4330.44s)]
*  This was cold, man. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4331.44s)]
*  It's pretty badass. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4332.44s)]
*  And then any one of those special little arrows, these are like bow and arrows. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4333.44s)]
*  Like this one of them, he just made in the house. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4335.44s)]
*  Well, that's a recurve bow. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4337.44s)]
*  He grabbed a stick and grabbed a string. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4338.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's a recurve bow. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4339.44s)]
*  That's a much harder bow to shoot than what I shoot. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4341.44s)]
*  I shoot a compound bow. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4343.44s)]
*  That takes real skill. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4345.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4347.44s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4348.44s)]
*  That roar that he has. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4349.44s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4350.44s)]
*  I'm very excited about this fight, man. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4351.44s)]
*  I don't know what kind of preparation he's done in terms of getting himself lighter for [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4355.44s)]
*  a five round fight and making sure that the cut is not as bad. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4360.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4364.44s)]
*  But he looks shredded already. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4365.44s)]
*  Yeah, he looks shredded, man. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4366.44s)]
*  And he look like he killing himself to make that weight. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4367.44s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4369.44s)]
*  He certainly is losing a lot of weight to make that weight. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4370.44s)]
*  He killing himself to get to that weight. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4373.44s)]
*  But he's done it many, many times. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4375.44s)]
*  But you see Izzy doing all this press, doing all this stuff. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4377.44s)]
*  Now, to be honest with you, I'd be like, it's a positive thing. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4380.44s)]
*  But at the same time, I ain't never seen him do this much work before or preparation for [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4382.44s)]
*  a fight where it comes to selling it. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4387.44s)]
*  You mean press? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4389.44s)]
*  Yeah, press. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4390.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4391.44s)]
*  But they make you do that. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4392.44s)]
*  I mean, this is nice. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4393.44s)]
*  It's square garden. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4394.44s)]
*  But this is the most I've ever seen. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4395.44s)]
*  I pay attention to these fighters all the time because they in the weight class. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4396.44s)]
*  I want to beat these guys. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4398.44s)]
*  I want to take their belt. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4399.44s)]
*  So I pay close attention to what they do all the time and especially Izzy because he's [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4400.44s)]
*  the champ. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4404.44s)]
*  So besides it just being ESPN, plus he got his own YouTube channel and everything like [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4406.44s)]
*  that. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4410.44s)]
*  And I mean, I feel like he didn't empty it up even more. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4411.44s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with that. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4414.44s)]
*  That's either showing me that you have a lot of confidence about yourself and you're able [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4415.44s)]
*  to take this fight. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4419.44s)]
*  I'm going to say not so serious, but not as serious because you're doing other stuff on [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4421.44s)]
*  top of this. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4425.44s)]
*  Alps Pereira is only focusing on training and fighting right now. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4426.44s)]
*  There ain't no press for him for real, for real. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4429.44s)]
*  So he's taking it into initiative. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4432.44s)]
*  I'm talking about Izzy to promote this fight as best as he can. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4434.44s)]
*  So you also taking away from your training at the end of the day. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4437.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4440.44s)]
*  So that's but I feel like he think he's good enough to do what he's going to do in order [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4441.44s)]
*  to take take time away from his training. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4447.44s)]
*  But isn't that just what the UFC obligates him to do? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4449.44s)]
*  Because he's selling the fight and he has pay-per-view points. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4452.44s)]
*  Not with everything. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4454.44s)]
*  But he has pay-per-view points. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4455.44s)]
*  I feel you. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4457.44s)]
*  But I feel like he also is the only one that speaks English. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4458.44s)]
*  Alex doesn't speak English. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4460.44s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4461.44s)]
*  So that makes it difficult. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4462.44s)]
*  But I feel like a lot of stuff he's been doing on his own as well. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4463.44s)]
*  Doing extra stuff. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4466.44s)]
*  Which I don't mind it because you got to promote the fight. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4468.44s)]
*  You got to do whatever you got to do in order to get people to buy in. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4470.44s)]
*  And to be honest with you, it's not that hard of a buy-in because even with Alps Pereira [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4473.44s)]
*  not being able to speak English, he's the only person that beat him. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4476.44s)]
*  The only person that knocked him out. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4479.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4481.44s)]
*  So that's an easy sell on itself. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4482.44s)]
*  So my thing is why is Alps Pereira trying so hard? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4484.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4488.44s)]
*  Like this is the one that if I wasn't MMA head and I was just like whatever, just watching [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4489.44s)]
*  this stuff, I'm like oh okay that would be interesting to watch. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4493.44s)]
*  Dude that already knocked him out. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4495.44s)]
*  This dude is undefeated in MMA but still could be a close fight. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4496.44s)]
*  I'll watch it. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4499.44s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4500.44s)]
*  But Izzy is going about his way and like I said I don't know what's going on in his head. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4501.44s)]
*  But I feel like he's not trying to think about the fight itself even though it is the press [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4505.44s)]
*  conference and all this other stuff. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4510.44s)]
*  He's trying to get himself more calm, right? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4511.44s)]
*  He wants to be around more people. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4513.44s)]
*  I forget who. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4515.44s)]
*  There's another fighter that talked about that and the reason why he always stayed in [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4516.44s)]
*  the press and in interviews because it took him away from the fight. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4520.44s)]
*  They always wanted to be in the light. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4523.44s)]
*  I forget what. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4525.44s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4526.44s)]
*  So the more you do other stuff you could just have fun and it loosens you up and talk to people. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4527.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4532.44s)]
*  And you ain't got to actually focus on the actual mission itself. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4533.44s)]
*  You just go to the mission. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4537.44s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4540.44s)]
*  It's two ways to go about it. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4541.44s)]
*  And I feel like if Izzy goes out, like I said, emotional, he will get caught. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4542.44s)]
*  So I feel like he needs to keep doing it. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4547.44s)]
*  Even when he plays around like I might just kick his leg and just jab him the whole fight. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4550.44s)]
*  Do that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4554.44s)]
*  Even with him joking, do that. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4555.44s)]
*  Because at the same time that's how you been winning your fights this whole time. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4557.44s)]
*  A lot of them. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4561.44s)]
*  The thing about Pajara is he's there to get hit. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4562.44s)]
*  He can be hit. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4565.44s)]
*  He fights with his hands down. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4566.44s)]
*  You said it right. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4567.44s)]
*  A mahogany tree. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4568.44s)]
*  He is that. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4569.44s)]
*  Like he's made out of wood. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4570.44s)]
*  But not run into him though. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4571.44s)]
*  You understand? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4572.44s)]
*  He's like built different man. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4573.44s)]
*  He's so dense. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4575.44s)]
*  Yeah, big fact. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4576.44s)]
*  I mean just the way he hit guys with that left hook. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4577.44s)]
*  And it's the crazy part. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4580.44s)]
*  It's not just him knocking them out but they all fall the same. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4581.44s)]
*  They fall like they just shut off. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4584.44s)]
*  Like they got shot. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4586.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4588.44s)]
*  I ain't never seen that before. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4589.44s)]
*  Even with Mike Tyson when he knocked out guys. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4591.44s)]
*  At least they fall in different type of ways. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4593.44s)]
*  But like you said, it's like he almost killing these guys. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4595.44s)]
*  It's like a straight blank shot to their boom. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4598.44s)]
*  And their whole body just shuts down. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4600.44s)]
*  Like the LFA knockout that he did. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4602.44s)]
*  I don't know who the dude he knocked out. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4604.44s)]
*  Find that fight. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4605.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4606.44s)]
*  I mean he's a motherfucker with that left hook. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4607.44s)]
*  But he's a motherfucker with everything. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4609.44s)]
*  You know when he knocked out Jason Willis. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4611.44s)]
*  You know hit him with a head kick and a flying knee. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4613.44s)]
*  He ain't had that many fights. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4615.44s)]
*  But hold on. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4616.44s)]
*  Did you see his loss though? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4617.44s)]
*  Which one? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4618.44s)]
*  He only had one. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4619.44s)]
*  In kickboxing? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4620.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4621.44s)]
*  Oh my bad. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4622.44s)]
*  In MMA? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4623.44s)]
*  In MMA. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4624.44s)]
*  Yes sir. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4625.44s)]
*  He got submitted correct? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4626.44s)]
*  He got submitted. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4627.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4628.44s)]
*  Yeah I did. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4629.44s)]
*  I saw it a while ago. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4630.44s)]
*  So it's hard to find. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4631.44s)]
*  I found it one time. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4632.44s)]
*  And that's why it gave me a lot of confidence. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4633.44s)]
*  Like to fight buddy. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4634.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4635.44s)]
*  Just seeing the fight that he had against dude. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4636.44s)]
*  And trust me dude was taking a lot of punishment. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4638.44s)]
*  Don't get it twisted. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4640.44s)]
*  Dude was tough as hell. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4641.44s)]
*  You know but just seeing how that guy was able to persevere through that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4642.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4646.44s)]
*  And still clinch up against Alex Pereira. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4647.44s)]
*  And wear him out and make him tired. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4649.44s)]
*  And get him to the ground. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4650.44s)]
*  And then eventually end up submitting him. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4651.44s)]
*  I'm like bro I'm going to put that dog work on. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4653.44s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4655.44s)]
*  That's the type of style that I bring. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4656.44s)]
*  I'm not going to be like who I'm fighting. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4658.44s)]
*  I'm still going to bring that style. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4659.44s)]
*  I don't care who you is. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4660.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4661.44s)]
*  So all I need to do is see that. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4662.44s)]
*  Like oh you ain't got that great of conditioning. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4663.44s)]
*  And it's not that you don't work out hard or you don't train hard. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4665.44s)]
*  You're cutting all this weight to get there. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4667.44s)]
*  Your body ain't never going to be 100%. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4669.44s)]
*  I also think that was very early in his approach to MMA. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4671.44s)]
*  And that was also. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4676.44s)]
*  Yeah low key. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4677.44s)]
*  But like six months later he was in the UFC. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4678.44s)]
*  But it was also before he was fighting Glover or training with Glover. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4679.44s)]
*  I think that made a big factor in both Glover and his career. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4682.44s)]
*  Might have but he's still fighting the same way to me. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4686.44s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4688.44s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4689.44s)]
*  Like I said I look at the last loss like even with not even lost with Izzy but like [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4690.44s)]
*  the fight with Kevin Gowson where he got touched the most. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4696.44s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4698.44s)]
*  And that's the fight that you look. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4699.44s)]
*  So here's this is what is this? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4700.44s)]
*  This is his kickboxing loss? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4703.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4704.44s)]
*  No he lost a few times in kickboxing. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4705.44s)]
*  Oh got good. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4706.44s)]
*  You got liver hooked. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4707.44s)]
*  Good body work. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4708.44s)]
*  Yeah I ain't seen this one. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4709.44s)]
*  That's a good kickboxing though. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4710.44s)]
*  That was a kickboxing fight. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4711.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4712.44s)]
*  Yeah he got caught with a left hook. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4713.44s)]
*  But I think Izzy beat homeboy right there though. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4714.44s)]
*  Leg kicks. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4715.44s)]
*  He's lost before. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4716.44s)]
*  Yeah yeah of course. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4717.44s)]
*  But again this is Alex early in his career. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4718.44s)]
*  But this kickboxing though man. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4721.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4722.44s)]
*  And this is why I'm trying to say like if I fought Alex Perreira I'm putting the single [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4723.44s)]
*  in on. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4726.44s)]
*  Mmm hmm. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4727.44s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4728.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4729.44s)]
*  Like I'm not going to play with you like you know I'm going to take the fight where [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4730.44s)]
*  I feel like I have more advantage than that. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4731.44s)]
*  Yeah he lost his last kickboxing fight in glory a very very close decision to I forget [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4733.44s)]
*  the gentleman's name but this Russian cat who's a. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4739.44s)]
*  No no no no no that wasn't me. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4741.44s)]
*  Not me. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4743.44s)]
*  Boy that was nasty. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4744.44s)]
*  That was insane. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4745.44s)]
*  That was. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4746.44s)]
*  Ah that was nasty. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4747.44s)]
*  I give him that but like I said yet again dude standing right in front of him. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4748.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4751.44s)]
*  Dude standing right in front of him. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4752.44s)]
*  He setting up that trap you know. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4753.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4754.44s)]
*  Yeah he setting up the trap. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4755.44s)]
*  Look look look. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4756.44s)]
*  Boom. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4757.44s)]
*  No that Izzy called that. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4758.44s)]
*  He was actually in the dressing room and he called that fight. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4759.44s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4760.44s)]
*  And that's Bruno Silva. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4761.44s)]
*  Yeah that's Bruno Silva. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4762.44s)]
*  And Bruno Silva was getting his ass whacked by Jordan Wright. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4763.44s)]
*  And I feel for Jordan Wright man. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4764.44s)]
*  He was. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4765.44s)]
*  You know he just got that little 50k though for a fight at night but he's just a one round [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4766.44s)]
*  fighter though I feel like. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4769.32s)]
*  Well he fights wild. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4770.44s)]
*  Yeah he fights wild. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4771.44s)]
*  So this is the Bruno Silva fight which is the only fight that he went in the UFC to [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4773.44s)]
*  decision. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4777.44s)]
*  But you see Bruno hit him with some shots. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4778.44s)]
*  Bruno clinched with him here. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4779.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4780.44s)]
*  Putting that dog fight. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4781.44s)]
*  Putting the dog fight on. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4782.44s)]
*  But as per usual he a dog too though you see him. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4783.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4785.44s)]
*  Still coming back. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4786.44s)]
*  Boom. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4787.44s)]
*  But he got him pressed up against the cage though. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4788.44s)]
*  Look he don't move his feet though. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4789.44s)]
*  He stand right in front of him. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4790.44s)]
*  And Bruno survived. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4791.44s)]
*  We have to put that out. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4792.44s)]
*  I mean and guys have finished Bruno. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4793.44s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4794.44s)]
*  But he survived against Pereira. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4795.44s)]
*  But again. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4796.44s)]
*  I mean the bell saved him a little bit. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4797.44s)]
*  Bell saved him a little bit. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4799.44s)]
*  But again you fight a guy like him like if. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4800.44s)]
*  Look look look. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4802.44s)]
*  In this fight even though he walked out of it with a decision that took something away [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4803.44s)]
*  from Bruno. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4808.44s)]
*  When you get a beating like this against a guy like Pereira. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4809.44s)]
*  You know that's also how I feel about Francis Sengano's first fight with Stipe. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4812.44s)]
*  Stipe won that fight but man he took a lot of punishment. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4816.44s)]
*  Oh we're talking about Stipe. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4819.44s)]
*  A lot of punishment. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4820.44s)]
*  Yeah a lot of punishment. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4821.44s)]
*  And I don't think you're the same after that. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4822.44s)]
*  There's certain fights where fighters. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4824.44s)]
*  That was the Shawn Strickland one. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4826.44s)]
*  Shawn Strickland was like almost like tailor made for him. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4828.44s)]
*  Walking forward. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4831.44s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4832.44s)]
*  So this is what I wanted to say too. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4833.44s)]
*  Because the reason why they need Alex Pereira is because there's nobody that's going to [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4834.44s)]
*  be able to. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4840.44s)]
*  Well not nobody because I could have done. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4841.44s)]
*  But regardless it's three walls that's saving Izzy right. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4842.44s)]
*  You know what those three walls is. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4845.44s)]
*  Robert Whitaker, Marvin Vittori and Jerry Kennedy. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4847.44s)]
*  If you're a fighter up come. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4851.44s)]
*  Matter of fact Nasruddin right. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4852.44s)]
*  I lost to him. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4853.44s)]
*  If he's trying to work his way up into fighting for a belt. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4854.44s)]
*  You gotta fight one of those guys. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4857.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4858.44s)]
*  If you can't beat those guys you not finna fight. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4859.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4861.44s)]
*  Alex Pereira did he fight any one of those guys I mentioned? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4862.44s)]
*  No. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4864.44s)]
*  No. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4865.44s)]
*  But I feel like Alex Pereira would get exposed if he fought any three of those guys. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4866.44s)]
*  Well I think that's one of the reasons why they fast tracked him to the title. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4868.44s)]
*  Because of the fact that it's hyped up. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4871.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4873.44s)]
*  It's a big fight. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4874.44s)]
*  It's all about money. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4875.44s)]
*  I think Marvin Vittori is a very tough fight for him. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4876.44s)]
*  Marvin Vittori, Robert Whitaker and Jerry Kennedy. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4878.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4880.44s)]
*  All three. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4881.44s)]
*  Vittori in particular is really good at takedowns. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4882.44s)]
*  Big fucking guy. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4883.44s)]
*  Big as fuck. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4884.44s)]
*  Big as fuck. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4885.44s)]
*  You see that guy, how the fuck is that 185 pounds? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4886.44s)]
*  I mean shoot, Paul LaCosta. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4889.44s)]
*  Actually that's one of the best fights I've seen in a minute between him, Marvin Vittori [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4890.44s)]
*  and Paul LaCosta. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4895.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4896.44s)]
*  Because they both fought at their natural weight. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4897.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4898.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4899.44s)]
*  Didn't cut any weight. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4900.44s)]
*  Didn't cut any weight. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4901.44s)]
*  Because at first I gave that same prediction. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4902.44s)]
*  At first I was like, bro if these guys fight in that 185 it's going to be the slowest dragged [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4903.44s)]
*  out fight because both of them are going to be depleted. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4906.94s)]
*  But instead Paul LaCosta didn't come in, cut him weight. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4908.44s)]
*  He was like, oh I don't want to cut weight man. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4910.44s)]
*  I want to be what? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4913.44s)]
*  He said 205 or something like that. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4914.44s)]
*  He was like, no I don't want to fight that 205 man. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4915.44s)]
*  I don't want to be heavyweight. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4916.44s)]
*  My man came in, damn they're like a heavyweight. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4917.44s)]
*  I don't care what nobody say. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4918.44s)]
*  So even though they made that 205 light heavyweight weight together, they were both just walking [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4919.44s)]
*  around. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4920.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4921.44s)]
*  Comfortable. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4922.44s)]
*  One of the craziest aspects of MMA, the day before a cage fight, you're supposed to dehydrate [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4923.44s)]
*  yourself to the point of death. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4926.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4928.44s)]
*  It's wild, ain't it? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4929.44s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4930.44s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4931.44s)]
*  And I'm trying to go back to it with my crazy ass. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4932.44s)]
*  But I'm trying to go back to the point of death. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4934.44s)]
*  I'm trying to go back to the point of death. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4937.44s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4941.44s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4942.44s)]
*  And I'm trying to go back to it with my crazy ass. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4943.44s)]
*  But my thing is though, it's just understanding they just keep getting bigger. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4944.44s)]
*  Yeah, they keep getting bigger because you can do it. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4947.44s)]
*  And my biggest thing is I'm not scared, but I got to be smart. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4950.44s)]
*  And being able to fight these guys, I got to realize I got to be safe in the first and [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4954.44s)]
*  second round. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4960.44s)]
*  That's why I didn't mind winning the main event because I feel like I could definitely [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4961.44s)]
*  put that pressure, had a condition, and go 25 minutes on the guys that's in middleweight. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4964.44s)]
*  So we can fight a little bit smarter, but only having three rounds, I can only do so [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4968.44s)]
*  much. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4972.44s)]
*  And that's what happened in the Nassar Dain fight. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4973.44s)]
*  I done ran out of time. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4974.44s)]
*  So I played myself. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4975.44s)]
*  But yeah, these guys, man, it's just crazy just to see the development of 185. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4978.44s)]
*  So a lot of these guys that's going up into the rankings and stuff like that, if you're [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4982.44s)]
*  not fighting those three guys right there and you don't beat them, you're not going [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4985.44s)]
*  to fight the belt. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4988.44s)]
*  So now that Alex Pereira was able to skip over the head, he was a knight, like you're [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4989.44s)]
*  playing chess, was able to skip over those three pawns, and now he's getting the king. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4992.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4996.44s)]
*  So that's lucky him. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4997.44s)]
*  I ain't even mad at it because we want to see something that's different. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=4998.44s)]
*  In my eyes, though, I just don't see it because I don't believe Alex Pereira has the skillset [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5002.44s)]
*  necessary to fight the type of style that we need to see Izzy against. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5006.44s)]
*  And what type of style do you think that is? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5011.44s)]
*  Aggressive, grappler, forward pressure, good hands, Kevin Gassum. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5013.44s)]
*  Even though Kevin Gassum lost, another style like that, a southpaw, I don't believe that's [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5017.44s)]
*  the only southpaw they default. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5022.44s)]
*  I believe Izzy. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5024.44s)]
*  Well, Yoel, Yoel's a southpaw, too. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5025.44s)]
*  But Yoel didn't do nothing. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5027.44s)]
*  Yoel was been a perfect, but he's still like this. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5029.44s)]
*  Yoel might be 60 years old. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5032.44s)]
*  We don't even know how old he is. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5034.44s)]
*  Then he went like a lawsuit or something? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5036.44s)]
*  Like then he get paid, like I don't know, like somebody was talking about that. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5039.44s)]
*  A supplement. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5042.44s)]
*  It was a supplement, like a tenant, whatever. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5043.44s)]
*  He got a bag from that. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5045.44s)]
*  Yeah, something happened. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5047.44s)]
*  I don't know how much he got. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5048.44s)]
*  But he just won his last fight in Bellator. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5049.44s)]
*  He did? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5051.44s)]
*  Who you went against? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5052.44s)]
*  No, no, actually I think I probably might know. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5053.44s)]
*  Melvin Manoff? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5056.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5057.44s)]
*  That's the beat that shit out of him. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5058.44s)]
*  No, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5059.44s)]
*  And I hate that because Melvin Manoff was one of the guys I looked up to, bro. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5060.44s)]
*  Oh my God, Melvin in his prime. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5063.44s)]
*  That boy was a pure savage. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5064.44s)]
*  Like that was the Mike Tyson kickboxing. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5065.44s)]
*  100%. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5067.44s)]
*  Come on now. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5068.44s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5069.44s)]
*  But just seeing like guys that get- [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5070.44s)]
*  With those gladiator shorts? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5072.44s)]
*  Come out with those gladiator shorts, shredded. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5073.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5074.44s)]
*  Come on. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5075.44s)]
*  We're in the leash. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5076.44s)]
*  To the death. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5077.44s)]
*  He come out to the death. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5078.44s)]
*  That dude fought like a fucking demon. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5081.44s)]
*  He was so good as a kickboxer. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5084.44s)]
*  You got knocked out Mark Hunt? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5086.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5088.44s)]
*  How about Mark Hunt knocking out that undefeated fighter at 48 years old? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5089.44s)]
*  You see that shit? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5092.44s)]
*  Mark Hunt, first of all, Mark Hunt- [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5093.44s)]
*  In Australia? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5094.44s)]
*  Mark Hunt still fighting? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5095.44s)]
*  Still fighting. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5096.44s)]
*  Won. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5097.44s)]
*  He won his last fight. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5098.44s)]
*  And he won too, huh? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5099.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5100.44s)]
*  Hey, shout out. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5101.44s)]
*  He fought this undefeated boxer and knocked him out. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5102.44s)]
*  He was like a huge underdog. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5105.44s)]
*  And why not knocking him out? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5106.44s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5107.44s)]
*  At 48 years old. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5108.44s)]
*  But my thing is, yo, why you think that is though? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5110.44s)]
*  Like, not why he knocked him out, but why you think these guys continue to fight like [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5112.44s)]
*  this? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5116.44s)]
*  At this age? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5117.44s)]
*  Well, I think Mark Hunt is born for it, first of all. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5118.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5119.44s)]
*  He loves it. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5120.44s)]
*  He's been around forever. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5121.44s)]
*  I mean, Mark Hunt was the K-1 Grand Prix champion. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5122.44s)]
*  Yeah, big fact. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5124.44s)]
*  Fought in Pride, in the glory days of Pride. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5125.44s)]
*  Yeah, I already heard. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5127.44s)]
*  Fought in UFC, in the glory days of the heavyweight division, and still slinging leather at 48 [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5128.44s)]
*  years old. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5135.44s)]
*  Yeah, but my- [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5136.44s)]
*  Massive respect. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5137.44s)]
*  And all that being said and done, you think you'd be done. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5138.44s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5141.44s)]
*  You know? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5142.44s)]
*  What more do you have to prove and show and do? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5143.44s)]
*  Anderson Silver, man, that broke my heart when you lost to Jake Paul, bro. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5145.44s)]
*  And you got this little kid, bro. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5149.44s)]
*  And he's doing his thing, right? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5151.44s)]
*  You see that he's an athlete. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5153.44s)]
*  You see that he's working on his style of fighting when it comes to boxing. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5154.44s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's picking at every MMA hit, right? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5158.44s)]
*  And he's fighting Tyrone Willie, Ben Asher, now Anderson Silver. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5164.44s)]
*  And then guess who he said probably going to be next, right? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5167.44s)]
*  Jake Paul. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5169.44s)]
*  No, Andrew Tate. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5170.44s)]
*  Oh, actually they just posted it. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5172.44s)]
*  They just faced off today. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5173.44s)]
*  But the name that he was talking about was Diaz, though. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5174.44s)]
*  At first. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5177.44s)]
*  Well, the Diaz fight is a big name and a big money fight, but he's a lot bigger. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5178.44s)]
*  He's a lot bigger than Nate. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5184.44s)]
*  Wait, but that's the point. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5185.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5187.44s)]
*  He wants as many advantage- [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5188.44s)]
*  He's doing it smart. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5189.44s)]
*  He is doing it smart, but at the same time, he embarrassing all of us. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5190.44s)]
*  Like, for real. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5193.44s)]
*  And it's sad because he's saying all these different things and he's talking about having [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5194.44s)]
*  these real conversations that need to be had, but it's coming from him who's not- [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5198.44s)]
*  He means about money. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5202.44s)]
*  You are, you know, but it's not a conversation for him to have. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5203.44s)]
*  But it is. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5206.44s)]
*  It is because it helps him get attention and it helps fighters take his point. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5207.44s)]
*  I love what he's doing. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5210.44s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5211.44s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5212.44s)]
*  I want to be the Diaz one. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5213.44s)]
*  I'm sure you do, but you're a fighter. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5214.44s)]
*  And I'm going to get a check for it, too. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5216.44s)]
*  But it's not because I'm just a fighter, because he's telling us that we're not even brave [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5218.44s)]
*  enough to fight for ourselves, so I'm going to fight for you while I'm knocking out your [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5223.44s)]
*  legends in the process of it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5226.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5228.44s)]
*  Well, what he's doing is very intelligent. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5229.44s)]
*  The promotion's off the chart. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5231.44s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5234.44s)]
*  He's brash. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5235.44s)]
*  And he's winning. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5236.44s)]
*  And he's winning. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5237.44s)]
*  But it's who he's winning against, though. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5238.44s)]
*  Yeah, but Anderson Silva, you got to say, that's the most impressive fight that he won. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5240.44s)]
*  You got to say Anderson Silva is a legend. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5245.44s)]
*  Maybe he's 47 years old. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5248.44s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5249.44s)]
*  I had Jake Paul to win. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5250.44s)]
*  I knew Jake Paul was going to win, just because of the age itself. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5251.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5254.44s)]
*  And then on top of that, I didn't see Jake Paul knocking out Anderson, either, though. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5255.44s)]
*  You understand? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5259.44s)]
*  I just knew he would be competitive enough for Jake Paul to take it. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5260.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5263.44s)]
*  Take the win. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5264.44s)]
*  But at the same time, it's just like, bro, if you fought Anderson when he was in his [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5265.44s)]
*  prime, you getting knocked out. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5272.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5274.44s)]
*  Well, you talking about... [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5275.44s)]
*  You talking about... [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5276.44s)]
*  Most certainly in an MMA fight. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5277.44s)]
*  Most certainly. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5278.44s)]
*  Not even most certainly in an MMA fight. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5279.44s)]
*  Anderson used to box, box, bro. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5280.44s)]
*  And that's the thing, too, I hate about MMA dudes, since we on here. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5281.44s)]
*  A lot of these dudes be like, I'll box Canelo, or I'll box Mayweather and all this stuff, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5286.44s)]
*  but never getting the actual ring and just training Spar with actual real boxers from [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5291.44s)]
*  whatever little, the neighborhood. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5297.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5299.44s)]
*  I used to actually box with the guys from the neighborhood and Pagedale boxing, like [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5300.44s)]
*  Temple, you know, Vaughn Alexander, Devon Alexander's brother. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5304.44s)]
*  I had to actually work with actual boxers to realize, oh, this is a different type of [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5309.44s)]
*  game. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5313.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5314.44s)]
*  But when you just boxing with the guys that's in the MMA room and you thinking, because [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5315.44s)]
*  you touching them, that you pretty decent, you going to find out if you actually getting [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5318.44s)]
*  in with a real boxer before you actually compete with them. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5321.44s)]
*  You don't know what you doing. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5324.44s)]
*  Because a certain little combination and a certain cadence that we do as MMA fighters [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5326.44s)]
*  that would get us knocked out from a boxer. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5330.44s)]
*  Have you thought about competing as a boxer? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5333.44s)]
*  Hell yeah, that's what the money is. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5335.44s)]
*  But the thing is though, it's so deluded because the whole perception of MMA guys won a box [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5337.44s)]
*  is because of money. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5342.44s)]
*  Because I would never just get into it for money. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5343.44s)]
*  My biggest thing is I would actually commit myself to the sport of boxing. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5345.44s)]
*  I would get me a boxing coach. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5349.44s)]
*  Like when, even George St. Pierre, I feel like he could have been pretty decent, you [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5351.44s)]
*  know, had a great jab in MMA, but you see he was working with who? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5355.44s)]
*  Freddie Roach. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5359.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5360.44s)]
*  Anderson Silva also found a boxing coach. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5361.44s)]
*  I forget who he was working with as well, but you could see him that he was training [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5363.44s)]
*  that art of boxing and he could actually compete in the actual ring. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5367.44s)]
*  So you would need a timeline. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5371.44s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5373.44s)]
*  How much time do you think you would need? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5374.44s)]
*  Well, since I already been working with boxers for a minute and I got a great boxing coach [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5376.44s)]
*  at STL Boxing, Reggie Thomas Child to him, I probably only need like two, three years [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5382.44s)]
*  to actually find me a profile. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5387.44s)]
*  And actually work up my work line. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5389.44s)]
*  But that's a realistic assessment. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5390.44s)]
*  I'm glad you said that. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5391.44s)]
*  Two, three years is correct. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5392.44s)]
*  Oh, yes sir. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5393.44s)]
*  You can't just hop into it. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5394.44s)]
*  A year time ain't just going to work for you. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5395.44s)]
*  And then I'm not just going to call out the best in the world, you know, pound for pound. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5397.44s)]
*  I'm going to work my way up. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5402.44s)]
*  I'm going to get some lockouts. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5403.44s)]
*  I'm going to get some good little names. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5404.44s)]
*  I'm going to get some prospects. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5405.44s)]
*  And then I'm going to, like once y'all see I got a resume now, now let's see what them [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5407.44s)]
*  names talking about. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5411.44s)]
*  Now when you're talking about your future, like how many more fights you have on your [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5412.44s)]
*  UFC contract? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5415.44s)]
*  Oh man, man, I'm going to keep that on. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5416.44s)]
*  How many do I have on my contract right now? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5417.44s)]
*  I just signed. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5419.44s)]
*  I just signed. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5420.44s)]
*  So I still got four, I guess. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5421.44s)]
*  So the CC is the new fight on the contract. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5424.44s)]
*  So I got a four fight contract. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5426.44s)]
*  When you get over those four fights, have you seriously considered? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5428.44s)]
*  I know exactly what my plan is. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5432.44s)]
*  What is your plan? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5434.44s)]
*  I can't give out the plan now. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5435.44s)]
*  Tell me later. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5436.44s)]
*  You be a fool. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5437.44s)]
*  I won't tell anybody. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5438.44s)]
*  Yeah, I can't tell you the plan now. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5439.44s)]
*  But you do have a master plan. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5440.44s)]
*  I got a master plan, baby. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5442.44s)]
*  It's beautiful too. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5443.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5444.44s)]
*  Yes sir. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5445.44s)]
*  I'm working on it. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5446.44s)]
*  So ideally when you move to 170, do you have a name in mind? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5447.44s)]
*  Oh man, yes sir. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5452.44s)]
*  So first off, you already shouted out one of Masvidal. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5454.44s)]
*  I didn't even think about him. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5457.44s)]
*  Masvidal. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5459.44s)]
*  I didn't even think about him. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5460.44s)]
*  But for Masvidal, he's looking for the top guys. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5461.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5464.44s)]
*  So he'd be a waste of time. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5465.44s)]
*  He'd be a waste of time. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5466.44s)]
*  So a real fight. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5467.44s)]
*  So we just talked about it. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5469.44s)]
*  And even though he a killer and I love him, right? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5470.44s)]
*  As a fan of MMA, Shavkat, right? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5473.44s)]
*  And he already got a fight booked with Jeff Neil. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5476.44s)]
*  I feel like if somebody fall out in that fight, I would love either one of those guys. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5478.44s)]
*  If somebody falls out. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5482.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5483.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5484.44s)]
*  Because both matches between me and Jeff Neil, we kind of fight similarly, right? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5485.44s)]
*  So it'd be a test of skills right there. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5489.44s)]
*  And Shavkat, we just don't know about him yet. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5491.44s)]
*  We're going to find out how good Shavkat is when he fights Jeff Neil, if he does or if he fights me. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5493.44s)]
*  We will really see how good he is. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5498.44s)]
*  When is that fight supposed to be taking place? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5499.44s)]
*  I have no clue. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5501.44s)]
*  January 23rd, I think. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5502.44s)]
*  Is that a fight night fight? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5504.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5505.44s)]
*  Oh, I might go to the Apex for that. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5506.44s)]
*  Is that the Apex? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5508.44s)]
*  Dude, I love going to the Apex. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5509.44s)]
*  Yeah, big fight. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5511.44s)]
*  I went to the Apex recently. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5512.44s)]
*  I watched Song Yudong and Corey Anderson. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5515.44s)]
*  No, uh. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5520.44s)]
*  No, you might have said it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5521.44s)]
*  Corey Sandhagen. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5523.44s)]
*  Corey Sandhagen. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5524.44s)]
*  I got you. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5525.44s)]
*  Sorry, Corey Anderson. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5526.44s)]
*  Shout out to Corey Anderson. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5527.44s)]
*  He's killing it in Bellator. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5528.44s)]
*  But Sandhagen and Song Yudong was a wild fight. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5530.44s)]
*  And to be there live with very few people in the crowd. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5533.44s)]
*  That Apex is something special, man. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5536.44s)]
*  I hated the fact that fighters had to fight there during the pandemic, but I love being there. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5539.44s)]
*  I think for me right now, even shout out to my man Charles Johnson. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5544.44s)]
*  He got a fight coming up. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5548.44s)]
*  You remember Charles. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5549.44s)]
*  Yeah, N.A.G. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5550.44s)]
*  He finally in the UFC. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5551.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5552.44s)]
*  A little shaky fight. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5553.44s)]
*  Dangerous flyway. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5554.44s)]
*  Big fight, man. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5555.44s)]
*  Big flyway. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5556.44s)]
*  I think it's a good start for a lot of guys in the UFC. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5557.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5562.44s)]
*  Sure. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5563.44s)]
*  Get their feet wet in the Apex. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5564.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5565.44s)]
*  Because the lights ain't so bright. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5566.44s)]
*  It's not like a whole arena and stuff. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5567.44s)]
*  You still get an audience. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5569.44s)]
*  You still get a little feel for it. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5570.44s)]
*  But I feel like that's where guys need to start off at. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5572.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5575.44s)]
*  At the Apex and then work their way up to a bigger venue type stuff. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5576.44s)]
*  No, I would agree with that. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5579.44s)]
*  I think the Apex is a good start off for a lot of guys. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5580.44s)]
*  Okay, does not have a location. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5583.44s)]
*  It might not be the Apex. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5585.44s)]
*  And see look, Kevin Gassel and Nasreddin. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5586.44s)]
*  Kelvin versus Nasreddin is a very good fight. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5588.44s)]
*  That's a very good fight. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5591.44s)]
*  But I think Kelvin Gassel could have been a world champion at 170. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5592.44s)]
*  I really do. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5595.44s)]
*  He just like eating. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5596.44s)]
*  He likes eating too much. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5597.44s)]
*  Look at Shavkat versus Jeff Neal. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5598.44s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5601.44s)]
*  And that's the thing though. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5602.44s)]
*  I know how talented Jeff Neal is. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5603.44s)]
*  So we're going to really see how good Shavkat is. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5605.44s)]
*  And Carlos Hernandez and Nasremento is a great fight too. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5607.44s)]
*  I ain't going to lie to you. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5611.44s)]
*  I don't know who those are. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5612.44s)]
*  Hernandez is the guy that submitted, fuck his name, that fucking gigantic jiu-jitsu guy. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5613.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5619.44s)]

*  He's a very good fighter too. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5633.44s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5635.44s)]
*  It's one of them underrated fights. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5636.44s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5638.44s)]
*  Who is that? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5639.44s)]
*  No, stop playing. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5640.44s)]
*  He's good. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5641.44s)]
*  How dare you? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5642.44s)]
*  How dare I what? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5643.44s)]
*  He's a good fighter. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5644.44s)]
*  Okay, 19, 19, oh, so you're a submission artist. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5645.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's a Brazilian cat. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5648.44s)]
*  He's very good, man. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5650.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5651.44s)]
*  He's very good. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5652.44s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5653.44s)]
*  I'm excited about that fight. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5654.44s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5655.44s)]
*  Okay, so this is 125. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5656.44s)]
*  So Fluffy ain't the right dude I'm talking about. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5657.44s)]
*  That's 125? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5659.44s)]
*  That's 125. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5660.44s)]
*  Oh, so that's a different Carlos Hernandez? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5661.44s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5663.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5664.44s)]
*  I was like, I don't recognize him. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5665.44s)]
*  I pay attention. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5667.44s)]
*  My weight class. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5668.44s)]
*  No, Fluffy Hernandez is not Carlos Hernandez. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5669.44s)]
*  This is his name. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5670.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5671.44s)]
*  Google Fluffy Hernandez. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5672.44s)]
*  But you're right about it because he submitted the dude that, and I mean. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5673.44s)]
*  Anthony is his first name. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5678.44s)]
*  Yeah, Anthony Hernandez. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5680.44s)]
*  Sorry, Anthony. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5681.44s)]
*  Anthony. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5682.44s)]
*  Who did he, he just won recently as well. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5683.44s)]
*  And you know what's funny about this though? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5686.44s)]
*  They called it the Kevin Hollen effect, right? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5688.44s)]
*  Because Anthony Hernandez and myself lost to Kevin Hollen. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5690.44s)]
*  Rodolfo Vieira, that's who he beat. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5694.44s)]
*  That was the big fight. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5696.44s)]
*  That was huge. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5697.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well, not a lot of people, but whoever better him. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5698.44s)]
*  And his last fight too. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5700.44s)]
*  Whoever better on him to win by submission got some good money. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5701.44s)]
*  Crazy money. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5704.44s)]
*  Yeah, big fan. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5705.44s)]
*  Because that is unheard of, the fact that he did that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5706.44s)]
*  He was able to submit one of the greatest Jiu Jitsu guys to ever compete in MMA. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5708.44s)]
*  Big fan. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5711.44s)]
*  And that's another guy that's enormous for that weight class. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5712.44s)]
*  Oh, big fan. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5715.44s)]
*  If you're standing next to Vieira, you're like, how the fuck are you making 85? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5716.44s)]
*  He's so big. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5720.44s)]
*  So on top of just talking about that, right? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5721.44s)]
*  So a lot of people on the internet, man, they be going crazy, man. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5723.44s)]
*  But they was like, it's the Kevin Hollen effect because Anthony Hernandez, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5726.44s)]
*  and Hernandez also lost to Kevin Hollen and then I lost, right? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5729.44s)]
*  So when I came back, I did my crazy kick after losing to him. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5732.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5735.44s)]
*  After he came back, he did his crazy submission on, you know what I'm saying? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5736.44s)]
*  Didn't nobody expect it. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5739.44s)]
*  So he was like, man, it might be a good thing to lose to Kevin Hollen, man. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5740.44s)]
*  You might have your crazy little next fight because my name blew up after that. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5743.44s)]
*  And then his name blew up after his little, you know what I mean? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5746.44s)]
*  And it was all just like, so it's just crazy how the internet just be going wild like that. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5748.44s)]
*  It is interesting how one big moment can just catapult your career. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5751.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5757.44s)]
*  I feel like it's only MMA, brother. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5758.44s)]
*  It's not like that. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5760.44s)]
*  Because you see a Marshal Dawg, you see a Diaz, you know what I mean? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5761.44s)]
*  Of course they didn't took losses, but all they needed was a couple wins, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5765.44s)]
*  a couple good finishes, bro, and their name was massive at the end of the day. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5768.44s)]
*  Well, that's also why you fight the way you fight, to get those big moments. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5772.44s)]
*  True story. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5776.44s)]
*  Because you're one of the most fan-friendly styles that's in the sport. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5778.44s)]
*  Well, it's just the people I used to watch and who I used to love watching. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5782.44s)]
*  So I just imitated them, man. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5785.44s)]
*  Like I said, Melvin Manoff was one of my favorite fighters, bro, to watch. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5786.44s)]
*  Rampage Jackson, man, with his personality outside the UFC and stuff. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5789.44s)]
*  And a lot of these guys that I used to be a fan of, those are the people that I imitated my style after. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5793.44s)]
*  And I just matched my own type of styling to it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5800.44s)]
*  Oh, Melvin, man. Jesus Christ. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5802.44s)]
*  Melvin in his prime. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5804.44s)]
*  It was so fun to watch. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5805.44s)]
*  Without a doubt, one of the most all-time scariest fighters. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5807.44s)]
*  Pure Savage, man. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5811.44s)]
*  And my man was only what? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5812.44s)]
*  Five, what? Eight, five, seven? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5813.44s)]
*  Yeah, he wasn't big. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5815.44s)]
*  And he was fighting Tyrone Spong, the Gohan Goku dude. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5816.44s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5823.44s)]
*  Yeah, Goh Kansaki. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5824.44s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5825.44s)]
*  He fought fucking Mark Hunt. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5826.44s)]
*  He fought Mark Hunt in the MMA. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5828.44s)]
*  And knocked Mark Hunt out. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5829.44s)]
*  In the first round, quick. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5831.44s)]
*  Mark Hunt tried to come after him real quick. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5832.44s)]
*  He was like, nah, forget that, sit down. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5834.44s)]
*  He was so fast. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5835.44s)]
*  Melvin in his prime was so fast. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5837.44s)]
*  And so savage. Those kicks were just insane. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5839.44s)]
*  Yeah, bro, a whole different level, man. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5842.44s)]
*  Yeah, well he was one of those guys out of Mike's Gym, those do or die guys. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5844.44s)]
*  Big fans. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5848.44s)]
*  Just like Badr Hari. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5849.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5850.44s)]
*  Whatever they're doing in that gym, man, they are creating monsters. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5851.44s)]
*  I don't even know if it's the gym, but the people that they bring in. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5854.44s)]
*  Like this type of lifestyle that you live and your upbringing is the biggest thing. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5857.44s)]
*  And that's what makes for a great fighter. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5864.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5866.44s)]
*  And I don't know much of Melvin Manoff past or anything like that. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5867.44s)]
*  But they were just talking about how he just come from humble beginnings and everything like that. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5870.44s)]
*  And how life was hard. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5874.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5875.44s)]
*  And I believe we was talking about Francis Ngannou in the back, whatever. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5876.44s)]
*  But we were just talking about how great of a fighter he is because of all the things that he had went through. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5880.44s)]
*  And when you see him walk around it and the way he carries himself, you can just tell like, can't nothing faze. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5884.44s)]
*  Can't nothing hurt him. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5889.44s)]
*  Just a fearless fighter. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5891.44s)]
*  But it was all because of what he experienced in his life that led to, like I said, so making fighting real easy now. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5892.44s)]
*  Did you hear the story that he told on this podcast? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5898.44s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5900.44s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5901.44s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5902.44s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5903.44s)]
*  On some movie type stuff. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5904.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5905.44s)]
*  Like come on, bro. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5906.44s)]
*  And just to believe, like to keep going through that. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5907.44s)]
*  And that's the thing too. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5909.44s)]
*  Like he could have risked dying to go, like you know what I'm saying, through that journey. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5912.44s)]
*  He did. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5915.44s)]
*  He did risk dying. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5916.44s)]
*  I know, but multiple times. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5917.44s)]
*  Eight times he got arrested. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5918.44s)]
*  Eight times. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5919.44s)]
*  Sent back to the desert. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5920.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5921.44s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5922.44s)]
*  And he was like, I'm going to keep going until I get there. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5923.44s)]
*  Like come on now. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5925.44s)]
*  That's perseverance right there. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5926.44s)]
*  Real perseverance. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5927.44s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5928.44s)]
*  So that right there alone, like I said, you can use those as examples that people actually [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5929.44s)]
*  go through to not stop doing what you're doing. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5933.679999999999s)]
*  Because I almost gave up on some bullshit. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5936.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5939.24s)]
*  Like what? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5940.24s)]
*  So like back in the past, like when I used to have a gym, it finished in May. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5941.24s)]
*  That's where I started. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5946.759999999999s)]
*  That's where I developed my skills a little bit. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5947.759999999999s)]
*  You know, but the promoter himself, me and him, like we was real close, you know. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5949.679999999999s)]
*  It was almost like on a father and son relationship type thing, you know. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5954.44s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know, I was never looking at it as business, you know. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5958.44s)]
*  He was always booking me up for fights and always, you know, putting me out there on [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5962.839999999999s)]
*  like a main event or the main card and stuff like that. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5967.2s)]
*  And people would come and watch me fight. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5969.4s)]
*  And I would be cool to do it because I just wanted to fight. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5971.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, that's all I wanted to do. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5973.32s)]
*  I had no other intentions, not even making money. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5974.48s)]
*  I just wanted to compete. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5976.799999999999s)]
*  And that was it. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5978.299999999999s)]
*  And, you know, not saying he's using me, but he's using me. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5979.299999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5982.4s)]
*  Technically because he's making money. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5983.4s)]
*  So he wasn't thinking about your overall career. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5985.36s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5987.759999999999s)]
*  He wanted to keep me stuck in St. Louis. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5988.759999999999s)]
*  But I didn't know no better anyway. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5991.04s)]
*  So my thing is I didn't want to reach out and find different other places to fight because [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5993.759999999999s)]
*  I'm like, shit, I'm getting fights here because he's a promoter. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=5997.32s)]
*  So at the end of the day, you know, once I started to grow as a fighter and stuff like [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6000.839999999999s)]
*  that, I ended up getting a Bellator fight. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6005.16s)]
*  I only got like a one fight contract deal when Bellator came to St. Louis. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6006.5599999999995s)]
*  So they do stuff like this, right. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6009.96s)]
*  Bellator comes to St. Louis and they assign like the local fighters on the prelim, right. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6012.28s)]
*  You get a one fight contract deal, but you would just fight the dudes that you would [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6016.8s)]
*  have fought on the local promotion, you know, anyway. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6019.8s)]
*  But now you just fight them on the Bellator show. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6022.74s)]
*  But I ended up showing out for Bellator, ended up going crazy. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6024.360000000001s)]
*  I fought, I know his name, I know his name. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6026.92s)]
*  It's sad, bro. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6030.0s)]
*  You know, I be forgetting my man's name sometimes, man. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6031.0s)]
*  But I think his name like Chris something. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6034.0s)]
*  Anyways, I ended up beating him. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6035.84s)]
*  Beating him in the second round. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6038.04s)]
*  This is when I first met Big John McCarthy, right. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6040.16s)]
*  So this is the first time like a big promotion, a big name referee actually like referee [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6043.88s)]
*  in my fight. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6047.72s)]
*  So end up beating dude, you know, end up getting signed to Bellator later on. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6048.72s)]
*  But before I had signed to Bellator, I looked for Jesse for advice. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6053.02s)]
*  I was like, hey man, should I read over this contract? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6057.4s)]
*  He's like, just sign it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6059.52s)]
*  Like don't worry about it. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6060.52s)]
*  Like this is the best contract you will ever see in your life. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6062.0s)]
*  Just sign the contract, right. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6064.28s)]
*  So I ended up signing the contract doing whatever, you know what I mean. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6065.92s)]
*  I ended up taking my first loss in Israel, whatever. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6068.4s)]
*  Once I took my first loss, they kind of held me back for a minute. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6071.92s)]
*  You know, I got a KO loss against Jackie Goss. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6075.5599999999995s)]
*  But like it took like seven months, eight months before I could even get back into actually [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6077.4s)]
*  competing, whatever. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6082.5199999999995s)]
*  But I was already ready. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6083.76s)]
*  I was like, bro, I can fight again. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6084.76s)]
*  Like I'm good, you know, because sometimes they'll put that restriction on you for you [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6085.76s)]
*  not to fight for a certain amount of time after KO. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6089.48s)]
*  But I was already cleared. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6092.32s)]
*  I'm like, hey, I'm ready to fight again. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6093.32s)]
*  So I ended up getting another fight. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6095.4s)]
*  And this was with Justin Patterson, I believe his name is. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6097.0s)]
*  So once I fought him, whatever, I had to string another fight, lay off another, it was another [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6101.76s)]
*  like eight, seven months again. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6108.68s)]
*  So with me, I'm getting paid, but I'm not really making no real money. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6110.52s)]
*  And all I'm doing is training. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6114.44s)]
*  All I'm doing is fighting. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6115.52s)]
*  I'm not doing nothing else. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6116.52s)]
*  All I'm doing is just focusing on that. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6117.68s)]
*  You know, so I'm really kind of just living off of these checks, you know. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6119.92s)]
*  And I'm not being smart about it because all I'm doing is just like, I just fighting [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6123.64s)]
*  thing. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6126.84s)]
*  This is what's going to work out. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6127.84s)]
*  So they end up giving me pretty much four fights. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6128.84s)]
*  So I end up fighting the Venetians, DeJesus, and they end up fighting Logan Storley, whatever. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6132.12s)]
*  So I only had four fights within like a two year period. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6138.52s)]
*  So I went to one year to the other. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6141.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6144.08s)]
*  So not enough. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6145.08s)]
*  Not enough. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6146.08s)]
*  I'm not even close. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6147.08s)]
*  No, you need not to eat. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6148.08s)]
*  No, and also to stay active. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6149.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6152.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6153.08s)]
*  But my thing on top of that, just going into the story where I almost, you know what I'm [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6154.32s)]
*  saying, just gave up on it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6157.32s)]
*  But you know, I was like, damn, man, I kind of just like lost out on a lot of experience, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6158.48s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6162.28s)]
*  Because like I was 22 when I got signed, you know, I was 24 then. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6163.28s)]
*  You know, so I'm just like, damn, I could have had a bunch more fights than what I had. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6167.48s)]
*  So Bellator ended up cutting me though, right? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6171.86s)]
*  Ended up letting me go. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6174.44s)]
*  So with all this being said, me and the promoter, whatever, we was bumping heads on a lot of [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6175.84s)]
*  things because I was like, bro, I want to learn more. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6181.28s)]
*  I want to do more. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6183.44s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6184.44s)]
*  Like, but I feel like I'm being held back. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6185.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6186.96s)]
*  So he would never really communicate with me what was really going on. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6187.96s)]
*  You know, and the thing is, the only thing like my man was just using me for like the [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6191.08s)]
*  potential to get more clients in the gym because they would use my name like, hey, we got a [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6194.92s)]
*  Bellator fighter here. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6199.12s)]
*  He's a trainer here and all this other stuff. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6200.36s)]
*  And they would use that to sell like for like, you know, more people just to sign up for [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6202.4s)]
*  the gym, you know, and it is what it is. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6205.639999999999s)]
*  But I just didn't like that, you know? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6208.679999999999s)]
*  So how did you get out of that? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6211.360000000001s)]
*  I just left. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6212.64s)]
*  I was like, man, forget this gym. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6213.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6214.64s)]
*  I literally just like, man, forget everything because once I got cut from Bellator, you [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6215.64s)]
*  know what I mean? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6219.240000000001s)]
*  I just like, man, that's some bullshit because like this is the highest level of, you know [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6220.240000000001s)]
*  what I'm saying, promotion. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6222.88s)]
*  Now I got to go right back into fighting on Shamrock. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6223.88s)]
*  That's some bullshit, right? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6226.08s)]
*  So I left the gym and I did my own thing, but the thing is, I ain't had no connections. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6227.56s)]
*  I have no network, like, you know what I'm saying, as in people to reach out to. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6232.76s)]
*  So when I was dealing with Jesse, he provided all them things for me. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6237.72s)]
*  The gym, the information for instructions, and also the promotion for the fight, you [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6242.84s)]
*  know? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6248.72s)]
*  So those are the main things I need and I didn't have it at that point, you know? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6249.72s)]
*  So I had to hop from gym to gym and try to find me another spot. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6253.06s)]
*  But every gym that I found, man, was kind of whack, you know what I mean? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6256.88s)]
*  I was like, bro, these ain't the ones I want to be at, you know? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6259.360000000001s)]
*  Because just like the instruction wasn't there or they weren't able to find me fights. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6262.0s)]
*  There had to be like multiple little reasons. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6266.5199999999995s)]
*  So I was like, man, why don't I just start doing this on my own? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6267.919999999999s)]
*  So I started hitting YouTube like crazy, you know? [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6270.36s)]
*  And I started just watching and just being a student of the actual craft and the actual [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6272.719999999999s)]
*  sport itself. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6277.48s)]
*  Like, what were you watching on YouTube? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6278.48s)]
*  Thousands of things, man. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6280.04s)]
*  I mean, it got to the point where it was so crazy. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6281.48s)]
*  I was watching Wing Chun, bro. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6283.679999999999s)]
*  Like, so Master Wu, I don't know if you know him, Master Wong, I think his name is, he [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6285.32s)]
*  does like a lot of self-defense moves, you know what I mean, online. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6290.08s)]
*  But he does funny instructional videos. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6294.08s)]
*  And I used to watch him all the time. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6296.64s)]
*  I watched Shane Fasson. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6298.0s)]
*  I don't know if you know who that is. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6299.48s)]
*  No. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6300.8s)]
*  You know, but actually, if you can look him up, like, so he does fight tips, whatever. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6301.8s)]
*  And he shows like all different things. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6305.64s)]
*  But these are the things that was like the foundation to me learning. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6307.16s)]
*  Shane Fasson? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6309.84s)]
*  Yeah, Fasson. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6310.84s)]
*  I don't know how to really spell his last name. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6311.84s)]
*  F-A-A-Z-E-N or something. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6313.28s)]
*  And you got it? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6316.88s)]
*  Jamie's got it. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6317.88s)]
*  And his, so his YouTube channel is just all instructional? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6318.88s)]
*  Literally just by fights. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6321.24s)]
*  Yeah, all instructional stuff like this. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6322.24s)]
*  So this is who I started off with. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6323.64s)]
*  So that's just his Instagram. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6324.84s)]
*  But his YouTube got like millions of followers on it though. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6326.160000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6329.56s)]
*  Check it out. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6330.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6331.56s)]
*  And so his whole thing is just, just instructionals? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6332.56s)]
*  Big facts, right. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6336.96s)]
*  Oh, Muay Thai, rock, paper, scissors theory. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6337.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6340.72s)]
*  So he's one of those dudes who's just breaking shit down constantly. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6341.72s)]
*  Man, and he got countless stuff on there. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6343.68s)]
*  But you know, and I'm not saying he's the best instructor at all, but when you talk [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6346.04s)]
*  about you just need more knowledge, you need more information. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6349.76s)]
*  These are the type of videos that I was watching. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6352.68s)]
*  It's amazing how many of those there are out there. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6354.360000000001s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6356.6s)]
*  For a young fighter, it's such a good time to learn. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6358.240000000001s)]
*  There's so much knowledge out there. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6361.76s)]
*  There's so much data. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6363.68s)]
*  And there's so many people like him that are obsessed with communicating that knowledge. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6364.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6369.4400000000005s)]
*  And then he was, you know, he used to work with, not work with, but like he had Faraz [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6370.4400000000005s)]
*  Zahabi on there, you know what I mean? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6374.76s)]
*  Breaking stuff down with him and stuff like that. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6376.6s)]
*  So then I got to see different, like real coaches and how to, yeah, so this is how I [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6378.360000000001s)]
*  got to see it. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6382.28s)]
*  Yeah, Master Wong right here. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6383.28s)]
*  So like this was like the street fighting element and all this other stuff and different [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6384.28s)]
*  techniques. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6386.88s)]
*  But because I didn't know some of these guys be sometimes low key like full of it, right? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6387.88s)]
*  What is he telling you to do there? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6393.24s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6394.8s)]
*  What's he telling you to do there? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6395.8s)]
*  Guys grabbing him? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6396.8s)]
*  What's the move? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6397.8s)]
*  You might have to turn it up a little bit. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6398.8s)]
*  It's not going to go very much. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6399.8s)]
*  My head is down, head but me. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6400.8s)]
*  It's not going to go very far either. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6401.8s)]
*  Second thing you learn to understand, that on the throw. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6402.8s)]
*  And he fast as hell though. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6403.8s)]
*  He be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he be, he [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6404.8s)]
*  C'mon man. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6406.46s)]
*  You should do! [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6423.46s)]
*  Like an Asian accent with an English accent. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6435.1s)]
*  I think he'd be capping though, you know? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6437.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6441.46s)]
*  Well, he's being entertaining. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6442.46s)]
*  Exactly, and that's what it is at the end of the day. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6444.26s)]
*  So this is mostly like street fighting stuff? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6446.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, all self-defense stuff, like just quick ways to end a fight, you know? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6448.780000000001s)]
*  Instead of hitting combinations, I want to hit one strike, you know what I mean? [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6453.18s)]
*  End the fight type thing. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6456.58s)]
*  But regardless though. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6457.58s)]
*  So you go from that to just watching YouTube videos, training yourself. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6458.58s)]
*  Did you have people that you were training with and sparring? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6463.66s)]
*  So I was just working with the guys that I was working with at Phenny's. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6467.139999999999s)]
*  So my close friend, the one that you just met, he's like a brother to me. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6470.26s)]
*  So we used to wrestle together in Marquette, you know? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6474.36s)]
*  And I actually got him into MMA, you know? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6476.82s)]
*  And the thing is, he's been watching the UFC for the longest time, but the actual training [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6480.5s)]
*  of it, he ended up coming to Phenny's MMA only because of me, you know? [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6485.54s)]
*  So we ended up training with each other. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6489.04s)]
*  Like I said, once I split ways with them, I was working with him the whole time. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6490.5s)]
*  So things that I would watch, things that I would see on YouTube, I was like, hey bro, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6494.74s)]
*  let's practice this. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6497.74s)]
*  Let's do this, you know? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6498.74s)]
*  And I actually got good at holding mitts, you know what I mean? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6499.900000000001s)]
*  Just because I wanted to see a lot of things and just work a lot of things that he couldn't [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6502.22s)]
*  perform, like actually hold for me, so I had to hold it for him, you know? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6505.78s)]
*  To actually get it down just a little bit. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6509.860000000001s)]
*  And to be honest with you, like I said, that got to show me a lot of different, just creative [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6512.22s)]
*  ways to throw your hands. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6516.900000000001s)]
*  A lot of different ways to throw combinations. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6518.7s)]
*  You don't have to throw it like a box, you don't have to throw it like a kickbox. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6520.66s)]
*  You can add those fun, traditional moves in there with the fundamental basics, you know? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6523.42s)]
*  And that's what we was doing. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6529.66s)]
*  We was just having fun and just doing that. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6530.66s)]
*  But the thing is though, I wasn't able to find any fights while I was doing this type [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6532.38s)]
*  of stuff. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6537.22s)]
*  How much time was going on here between you leaving that gym? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6538.22s)]
*  So I got cut in 2018, that's when I left the gym, in 2018. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6540.46s)]
*  And then I was able to get a fight in 2019. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6544.76s)]
*  It was only a year's time, but I felt like I got played with the two years that, in 2016 [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6548.56s)]
*  to 2018, I felt like I got played, you know what I mean? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6554.280000000001s)]
*  And not having that many fights and I was still struggling as a fighter. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6557.360000000001s)]
*  And I was with Bellator and I was still struggling, Loki. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6560.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6563.16s)]
*  So I felt like I wasted a good amount of time, you know what I'm saying, within that game. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6564.2s)]
*  But I didn't know when I was going to be able to fight again. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6568.6s)]
*  That was the problem. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6570.68s)]
*  So even though it was only like, well it was kind of close to two years, but it was still [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6571.88s)]
*  like just a year and some change that I was able to find another fight. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6575.8s)]
*  It still felt like it was so stretched out because I didn't see when I was going to be [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6578.96s)]
*  able to find another fight. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6582.08s)]
*  So you were really considering quitting? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6583.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6585.52s)]
*  I mean, well I actually, I wasn't considering it. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6586.52s)]
*  I actually did it. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6587.52s)]
*  So I went about the part of just training, but I just gave up on actually hunting the [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6588.76s)]
*  dream down. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6593.64s)]
*  I just got a regular job, you know what I mean? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6594.64s)]
*  I was taking care of my grandmother at the time, which that was a big deal as well. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6596.92s)]
*  I had moved in with her because I didn't have no house, I didn't have anything to my name. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6601.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, my grandmother was stricken with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, you know what [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6604.88s)]
*  I mean? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6609.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's a rough one. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6610.5199999999995s)]
*  I have a friend going through that right now. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6611.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6613.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to hear that. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6614.0s)]
*  But it's a neuron disease where it shuts down all your motor functions, and it kills [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6615.0s)]
*  the muscles where it puts you in paralysis almost. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6620.68s)]
*  And that's what I was dealing with the whole time as well too. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6624.12s)]
*  So a lot on my mind outside of that. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6626.94s)]
*  So I was like, man, I can't be focused on trying to chase a dream when I got to help [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6629.3s)]
*  my grandmother wash up and eat and all this other stuff, this type of stuff. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6632.22s)]
*  So yeah, I had to go through that first, right? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6636.74s)]
*  And once I went through that, it's funny how once I kept training and kept motivated with [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6639.7s)]
*  just my friends around me, even Mariah Beck, that's one of the kids that trained with me [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6644.34s)]
*  at Phineas MMA, but anytime I called him up, he would work with me. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6648.78s)]
*  RIP to my man Ryan Sutton. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6651.74s)]
*  He was one of the guys that came out with me in my first UFC fight, but he passed away. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6654.1s)]
*  But that's another person that I looked to and called in order to get some training in. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6658.9s)]
*  But it was just a small group of guys that I would call up to just ask to get some work [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6663.0s)]
*  in. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6666.66s)]
*  And these guys are the people that I depended on in order to, my mental, just to hit paths [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6667.66s)]
*  outside in Forest Park in St. Louis. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6672.599999999999s)]
*  And this whole time I've been doing that, and I just stopped chasing after the whole [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6675.219999999999s)]
*  goal of getting a fight. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6678.7s)]
*  And then one day a guy named Mike Rogers hit me up because I was coming in at his gym, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6680.54s)]
*  not in and out, but just coming there just to get some sparring work in, you know what [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6684.66s)]
*  I mean, but not actually learning anything, but just some sparring work. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6688.26s)]
*  And he told me, like, hey man, LFA hit me up. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6691.06s)]
*  I was like, oh for real? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6693.1s)]
*  He was like, yeah man, if you want to, I can give you their number or whatever and then [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6694.1s)]
*  you can contact the matchmaker yourself because he didn't want to do the in-between talk for [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6697.46s)]
*  me. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6701.42s)]
*  He didn't want to be like a management because I didn't have no manager, I didn't have nothing [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6702.42s)]
*  at the time. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6704.820000000001s)]
*  So he told me about LFA and I ended up getting a fight with LFA against Chris Harris. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6706.42s)]
*  But the funny thing about that, that little setup was that I only took the fight because [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6711.26s)]
*  I needed some money, some extra money. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6716.66s)]
*  That was it. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6718.66s)]
*  But the only reason why I took the fight as well, because I couldn't find any other fight [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6719.66s)]
*  at welterweight. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6724.74s)]
*  So I had to fight at middleweight at 185. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6726.62s)]
*  And they tried to tell me it was a catchweight. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6729.26s)]
*  I was like, what's the weight? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6730.26s)]
*  I was like, is it 175 or 180? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6731.26s)]
*  They was like, no, 185. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6734.26s)]
*  I was like, man, that's a whole weight class. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6735.26s)]
*  So when they told me that, whatever, I watched the dude, I did my own film study on Chris [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6738.26s)]
*  Harris and I was like, I'll take it. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6741.86s)]
*  It's easy money. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6743.34s)]
*  I need the bread anyway. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6744.34s)]
*  And funny enough, that's why I stayed at 185. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6745.38s)]
*  That was the only reason why I moved up. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6747.38s)]
*  Because then nobody wanted to fight me at 170 at welterweight that whole time. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6749.38s)]
*  So I took that fight, got that fight, but I didn't worry about it. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6754.82s)]
*  Once I won that fight and got that little check that I got from LFA, I was back to work [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6757.14s)]
*  doing what I was doing, just chilling. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6760.54s)]
*  And then a year later, I still get another call, this is 2020 now, from LFA to fight [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6762.9800000000005s)]
*  Gregory Rodriguez. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6768.42s)]
*  I don't know if you know who that is. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6769.42s)]
*  Robocop. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6770.66s)]
*  He know what I got is head split. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6771.66s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6774.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but I need that bread at the time too. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6775.3s)]
*  So I took that fight with him. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6778.820000000001s)]
*  It was going to be for a LFA title. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6780.820000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, he had pulled out the fight. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6783.7s)]
*  So they had to find me another fighter. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6787.26s)]
*  And like I said, funny enough, me not even chasing anything, but people just coming to [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6789.38s)]
*  me now, I was able to get these fights. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6793.62s)]
*  When did you wind up at the new gym? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6795.820000000001s)]
*  That wasn't until the kick. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6801.820000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6804.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6805.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't have no team. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6806.0199999999995s)]
*  I just had the people I told you I was working with. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6807.0199999999995s)]
*  So even the Kevin Holland fight, no team. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6808.0199999999995s)]
*  The guy that passed away, RIP Ryan Sutton, he the one that helped corner me in that fight, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6810.22s)]
*  but he was just a teammate. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6814.3s)]
*  He was going through stuff in his own life as well. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6815.94s)]
*  So you were just kind of on your own training yourself. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6817.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6820.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6821.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6822.62s)]
*  Fighting at a world-class level, on your own, training yourself in the UFC against top guys. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6823.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6830.42s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6832.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, to even be able to get there the way we got there is crazy in itself. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6833.62s)]
*  Because like I said, I only took those LFA fights because I needed a little bit of money. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6836.06s)]
*  But I wasn't like, all right, I'm going to be in the UFC one day or I'm working towards [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6839.900000000001s)]
*  to be a UFC champion. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6843.5s)]
*  I just was like, I need money or just for my mental health, I kept training. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6844.5s)]
*  Now, but I want you to speak to the difference in the structure. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6848.42s)]
*  Once you got to this new gym and all this structure that you're praising and all the [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6851.5s)]
*  way that your new trainer trains you in the new environment, how much different is that [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6855.46s)]
*  and how much of an impact has that had on your career? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6860.98s)]
*  I think the biggest part of it was just the commitment that they had to me, that I never [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6862.98s)]
*  got from that other gym. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6868.099999999999s)]
*  So all the information that I had to find on my own, they had information for me. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6869.66s)]
*  So I was actually learning. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6873.82s)]
*  So instead of trying to figure out the information on my own, I already had people that was already [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6876.18s)]
*  great at what they did and they was showing me stuff. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6879.62s)]
*  And now I'm able to learn a little faster and more efficiently, if that makes sense. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6882.9s)]
*  That is so incredible that you were fighting on a world class level with no coaching. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6886.58s)]
*  Nah, I mean, I did have world class coaches because you got to just imagine the people [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6890.34s)]
*  that I've been watching for influences as instructors on YouTube. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6894.78s)]
*  Like I said, even from yourself, bro, even if you don't call yourself a coach, that sidekick, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6898.98s)]
*  I only knew how to throw a sidekick because I watched your video. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6903.1s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6905.62s)]
*  It's hilarious, but it's the truth. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6906.62s)]
*  I wish I was around to show you in real life. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6907.62s)]
*  It would be even better. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6911.34s)]
*  Big facts, you know what I mean? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6912.74s)]
*  But even though you showed, with the internet and everything and YouTube, you showed a thousand, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6913.9800000000005s)]
*  if not a million people that kick. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6919.42s)]
*  But it's about people actually taking that information and applying it to their own life [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6921.7s)]
*  if they want to. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6925.5s)]
*  And that's why I like Bruce Lee so much because that's why Jit Kundo is such an awesome style [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6926.5s)]
*  because it was his own style. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6931.9400000000005s)]
*  It was his own form of fighting that he took and that he mastered, but he took it from [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6933.38s)]
*  other places. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6937.9800000000005s)]
*  And he did it back when that was taboo. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6938.9800000000005s)]
*  Big facts, you know what I mean? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6941.26s)]
*  That was very taboo. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6943.18s)]
*  Even when I was doing Taekwondo, you weren't supposed to do other things. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6944.18s)]
*  You were supposed to only concentrate on the art that you did. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6946.14s)]
*  Big facts. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6949.02s)]
*  And Bruce Lee was like, that's not smart. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6950.02s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6952.22s)]
*  Because your style of fighting should be like a fingerprint. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6953.22s)]
*  You should have your own style. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6956.14s)]
*  It shouldn't be like a person, when you look at them, you're like, oh, they doing kickboxing. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6957.860000000001s)]
*  MMA, in my opinion. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6961.14s)]
*  Oh, they doing kickboxing. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6962.14s)]
*  Oh, that's a wrestler. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6963.14s)]
*  It's a mixed martial arts. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6964.14s)]
*  You should be trying to pick the pieces in the puzzle, like what they actually doing. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6965.14s)]
*  Well, you mostly see that now. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6968.5s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6970.74s)]
*  You see very few real specialists now that are only doing one thing. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6971.74s)]
*  You still do though, low key. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6974.74s)]
*  I mean, we getting there, but I still haven't seen that actual, like for real, on some boy [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6975.74s)]
*  good. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6980.38s)]
*  Like I said, man, I'm from, like, you know, I've been watching a lot of movies and stuff, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6981.38s)]
*  but like, you know, one of those complete fighters, you know, except for like Demetrius, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6984.58s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6988.9s)]
*  Or GSP, you know? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6989.9s)]
*  There ain't a lot of those out there though, in my opinion. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6990.9s)]
*  Well, I think you're seeing more of them now than ever before, but we have to also take [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6993.46s)]
*  into consideration that MMA in terms of real sports is relatively recent. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=6997.379999999999s)]
*  There's no sport like MMA where if you go and watch the fighters from 1993 and watch [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7002.379999999999s)]
*  it from 2022, they're completely different. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7006.7s)]
*  Yeah, completely, because the athlete changes though. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7010.339999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7012.82s)]
*  You know? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7013.82s)]
*  So that's why I would say that, but I feel like yet again, so like Habib, perfect example, [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7014.82s)]
*  you know, he retired, like he was only winning one type of way. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7018.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7021.78s)]
*  You know? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7022.78s)]
*  He's a real specialist. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7023.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's a real specialist. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7024.78s)]
*  But man, good at that fucking special. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7027.22s)]
*  Jesus Christ, he was so good. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7029.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of people can't stop it, you know? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7031.42s)]
*  But I'm just trying to think like good, like people that they fight a certain type of style, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7033.54s)]
*  which is great for them and it fits them way, but like Hamza, I wouldn't call him like a [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7038.26s)]
*  complete fighter. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7043.7s)]
*  I feel like he's just great at what he does. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7045.22s)]
*  And if he's able to fight another grappler, he's able to switch it up to a striking prowess, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7047.7s)]
*  but even then Gilbert Burns was touching him. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7052.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7055.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I would say the Merck-Sharp fight, but like he only got one punch out of that, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7056.46s)]
*  you know? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7059.5s)]
*  But you can't call him no great striker because he was able to land that one punch. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7060.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7062.820000000001s)]
*  But when I seen that he fought Gilbert and he started to stand with him, I'm like, oh, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7063.820000000001s)]
*  you're not a great striker. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7066.26s)]
*  Because Gilbert Burns is not a great striker, but he was able to land I don't know how many [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7067.660000000001s)]
*  punches on Hamza in that fight. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7070.42s)]
*  Gilbert's a wild man. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7072.700000000001s)]
*  Gilbert's a wild man. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7074.14s)]
*  Yeah, I feel you. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7075.14s)]
*  Wild man is, yeah, you could be a wild man all you want to, but at the end of the day, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7076.14s)]
*  it still takes technique in the striking man. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7079.06s)]
*  Oh, he's got technique too, but it's just one of those things where I think Hamza tried [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7080.660000000001s)]
*  to walk him down and you want to engage like that with Gilbert, you're going to get caught. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7084.34s)]
*  I'm not disrespecting these guys when I say it, but they good at what they good at. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7090.74s)]
*  That's all I'm trying to say. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7095.26s)]
*  Like, Gilbert Burns is a monster, but you see when Hamza had took him down and Gilbert [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7096.26s)]
*  Burns threw up them legs a couple times. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7099.78s)]
*  Hamza didn't like that. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7101.54s)]
*  He's like, let's stay on the feet for a minute. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7102.54s)]
*  And then I realized, oh, Hamza ain't good at striking because he just stands right there. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7105.18s)]
*  And also, I'm in fact, I shouldn't even say it because I could potentially fight this [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7110.04s)]
*  man one day. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7113.06s)]
*  But one thing that he does that is terrible, he only hits on one side. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7114.06s)]
*  He favors one side too much as a striker. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7118.46s)]
*  And we watch it all the time. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7121.620000000001s)]
*  Now you can take it back and watch Hamza fight, but when you watch you, that's what he's talking [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7123.5s)]
*  about. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7127.9800000000005s)]
*  Right hands. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7128.9800000000005s)]
*  All day. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7129.9800000000005s)]
*  Right hands, right feet. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7130.9800000000005s)]
*  Uppercut, all day. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7131.9800000000005s)]
*  And he favors it. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7132.9800000000005s)]
*  No setup. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7134.700000000001s)]
*  Everything just with power and intention to knock you out, which is great and all, but [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7136.14s)]
*  you still putting yourself in a position to get hurt. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7139.580000000001s)]
*  Were you stunned by that Kevin Holland fight with him? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7142.3s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7144.7s)]
*  I wasn't stunned because I knew Hamza was going to immediately try to shoot. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7146.7s)]
*  And Kevin is not like no real, real wrestler. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7150.5s)]
*  He worked with DC and he said he worked with Johnny Hendrix and all this stuff. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7152.780000000001s)]
*  It take years. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7156.9800000000005s)]
*  I come from a wrestling background. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7157.9800000000005s)]
*  I was a trash ass wrestler in high school. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7160.26s)]
*  It took me years to kind of understand what wrestling is. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7163.820000000001s)]
*  And I'm still trying to figure it out. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7166.42s)]
*  I know I'm a better wrestler than the majority of guys that's at the 185 division, some of [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7168.06s)]
*  them. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7172.820000000001s)]
*  But now I'm going to have to focus on grappling even more because I'm going to a grapple heavy [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7173.820000000001s)]
*  division, which is at 170. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7178.780000000001s)]
*  You have Hamza, Kobe Covetan, Kamaru Usman. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7181.620000000001s)]
*  These guys are grapple heavy. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7187.22s)]
*  So if I'm able to get up to that level and be able to compete with them, it just stuff [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7188.780000000001s)]
*  the shot. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7192.9400000000005s)]
*  I know that they couldn't compete with me on the feet. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7193.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7196.42s)]
*  When you think about your transition from being self-coached to now being on your own [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7197.42s)]
*  team, it's like you have so much potential right now. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7204.02s)]
*  There's so much potential to get even so much better. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7208.3s)]
*  This is all I get to focus on now. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7210.74s)]
*  Even with my grandmother, her daughter, my auntie came back to live with her, to take [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7212.82s)]
*  care of her because I wouldn't be able to be in the UFC if I had to keep taking care [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7220.9s)]
*  of my grandmother. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7225.62s)]
*  Low-key, people don't even understand. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7226.62s)]
*  That's a 24-hour thing. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7227.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7228.62s)]
*  You understand? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7229.62s)]
*  It was sad because I had to leave my grandmother in the bed in order to go to work to Walgreens, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7230.62s)]
*  but I had to have a close job. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7236.58s)]
*  I had to keep a monitor to watch her to make sure that she was fine. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7238.42s)]
*  Everything that she needed, I had to leave the job. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7241.22s)]
*  I had to work overnights at Walgreens in order to make sure I check up on her throughout [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7244.18s)]
*  the day. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7248.22s)]
*  So I had to work the night shift. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7249.22s)]
*  So when she slept, I was working. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7250.86s)]
*  So just little things like that. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7253.62s)]
*  It was hard to actually maintain an actual career as a fighter. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7257.34s)]
*  When I was a kid, when I was 24, I lived with my grandmother for a while, my grandmother [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7261.66s)]
*  and my grandfather. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7265.179999999999s)]
*  My grandmother had a stroke and they gave her 72 hours to live and she wanted to live [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7266.179999999999s)]
*  for 12 years. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7271.66s)]
*  I was there with my grandfather when my grandfather was taking care of her 24-7. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7273.74s)]
*  One thing that imparted upon me is that life is short and that you got to appreciate your [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7278.28s)]
*  health and your ability to do things now and appreciate it in a way where knowing my grandmother [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7284.28s)]
*  when I was young, when she was this wild lady, and then seeing her, my grandmother went to [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7289.48s)]
*  jail for running numbers for the mom. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7294.28s)]
*  My grandmother was wild. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7298.599999999999s)]
*  They tried to get her to give up names. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7300.44s)]
*  She's like, fuck that, I'm going to jail. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7302.679999999999s)]
*  So we were always like, where's grandma? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7305.08s)]
*  Oh, she's visiting her, Auntie. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7307.16s)]
*  They lied to us. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7310.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, grandma was in jail for running numbers. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7311.320000000001s)]
*  It was kind of crazy. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7314.2s)]
*  So to see her when I was older, when I was 20, in my 20s, that sick and inability to [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7315.56s)]
*  move and pain all the time, it was like, damn, you got to do something with your life. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7323.64s)]
*  That's 100%. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7328.360000000001s)]
*  Short window. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7330.360000000001s)]
*  Even with my grandmother going through that, she still had great spirit. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7331.24s)]
*  What's sad about ALS, the first thing that went was her voice. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7337.16s)]
*  Her voice became faint. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7343.0s)]
*  She wasn't able to speak and all these other things. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7344.599999999999s)]
*  But she's still able to smile. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7347.8s)]
*  And it's sad that about this disease, that can take that away as well. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7351.32s)]
*  But she's still able to smile and still able to laugh about certain things. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7356.679999999999s)]
*  That's one thing about my grandmother, her spirit is so, has such an impact that it can [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7361.719999999999s)]
*  affect you. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7368.599999999999s)]
*  Because she don't look down on herself because she was stricken with this terrible disease. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7369.96s)]
*  Even with it stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it's the actual name. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7375.4s)]
*  She even changed the acronym where ALS stands for abundance of love and support. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7379.88s)]
*  Because that's what you need in order to defeat something like this. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7386.28s)]
*  I had that with her because she lost her daughter which was my mother. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7391.4s)]
*  I lost her at a young age and my grandmother took me in. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7395.719999999999s)]
*  I didn't have my dad around in my life so she was the one that was taking care of me the whole time. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7400.5199999999995s)]
*  So when it came to my turn, I couldn't hesitate. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7404.5199999999995s)]
*  I was willing to give up everything in order to take care of my grandmother. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7410.2s)]
*  It just had to be that way. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7414.76s)]
*  That speaks to your character. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7415.48s)]
*  Regardless though, I wouldn't even be around if she was never around in the first place. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7417.400000000001s)]
*  But I understand what you're saying. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7423.080000000001s)]
*  That really shows me anything I really go through ain't really that hard. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7424.360000000001s)]
*  We good, we can get through it. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7430.280000000001s)]
*  Having her go through this type of experience and being able to see what she goes through [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7433.64s)]
*  but how she's still able to hold her head high is beautiful. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7436.84s)]
*  That is beautiful. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7439.400000000001s)]
*  Now I feel like every fighter is not just their skills but an accumulation of their [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7441.16s)]
*  life experiences that give them character. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7447.88s)]
*  That most certainly gave you character. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7450.599999999999s)]
*  I guess. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7453.72s)]
*  Like I said, my granny took the responsibility up when nobody else wanted it. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7454.44s)]
*  Like I said, with my mom and stuff, being a single mom, she raised me. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7458.679999999999s)]
*  I was with her all the time. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7462.92s)]
*  Every single day I was with my mom. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7464.84s)]
*  If I wasn't with her, I was with my godmother. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7467.08s)]
*  So I was around a lot of women at the time. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7469.88s)]
*  I told you before, the male influences, the only thing I got was from TV and watching [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7471.64s)]
*  movies all the time. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7476.2s)]
*  Having that and doing what I was doing, it's just crazy that once my mother had passed [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7479.0s)]
*  away, unfortunately some of the people that was in my life before left too. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7486.12s)]
*  The people I used to always see or hang out around that was around my mom a lot, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7492.84s)]
*  when she passed away. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7496.36s)]
*  It's like they passed away with her. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7498.2s)]
*  My granny was the only person that really took the responsibility of raising me and [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7500.76s)]
*  taking forth that because I went through a depressing stage. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7504.5199999999995s)]
*  I was never seen a therapist or nothing but I felt like I went through a depression stage [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7508.12s)]
*  after I lost my mom and it took me a while to even speak to people. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7515.5599999999995s)]
*  And I turned mute and nothing. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7520.599999999999s)]
*  But it took me a while to even just be around other people because I was just so upset [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7522.28s)]
*  that the person that I was around all the time was just completely gone. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7526.76s)]
*  Just out of nowhere in my eyes. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7530.36s)]
*  It took a minute for me to just accept the fact that she was gone. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7533.08s)]
*  I won't even say get over it but I just kind of forgot about my mom ever existing to get [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7537.56s)]
*  over the whole fact that she was gone in the first place. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7545.56s)]
*  I didn't even go to her burial or nothing. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7548.84s)]
*  I couldn't take it. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7553.32s)]
*  So I was just like man maybe if I just forget about it it'd be cool whatever. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7554.92s)]
*  But on top of that just understanding that life is short like you were saying before. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7559.16s)]
*  It's good just to go for your dreams and stuff like that. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7565.0s)]
*  Because I ain't trying to bounce into too much stuff but before my granny even had ALS [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7568.12s)]
*  and stuff and I was still in high school, she was raising me the whole time. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7575.0s)]
*  I was kind of a bad kid. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7579.879999999999s)]
*  In and out the house doing what I wanted to do. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7583.32s)]
*  I wasn't bad like robbing people or trying to gang bang or nothing like that but I wanted [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7585.32s)]
*  to do what I wanted to do. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7589.32s)]
*  Being raised by so many women you feel like you demand the whole time. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7591.639999999999s)]
*  Eventually my grandmother ended up asking for my father's help in order to come back [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7595.719999999999s)]
*  into my life and stuff like that and try to raise me or help raise me. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7599.32s)]
*  I'm like 16 at the time, 15 at the time. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7603.08s)]
*  This is my first time really even meeting this man. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7606.599999999999s)]
*  So once I had an interaction with him I was trying to tell my granny I don't need to stay [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7610.2s)]
*  with him I'll just leave. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7616.36s)]
*  I'll just live on my own. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7617.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7618.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll run away type shit. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7619.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7620.44s)]
*  My dad was like yeah you being disrespectful you acting out apocalyptic and stuff like that. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7623.32s)]
*  I was like yeah even if I is what you gonna do about it? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7627.32s)]
*  And this is where we had a whole situation, a whole scenario. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7630.12s)]
*  So the only reason why this is crazy is that I find out where my fighting power comes from. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7633.16s)]
*  It's from my pops because my pops used to wrestle as well back in the day. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7640.04s)]
*  So when I used to wrestle in high school I thought I was somebody special. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7643.48s)]
*  So when I got into it with my dad whatever and we was in the kitchen and stuff like that [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7646.28s)]
*  I thought I had the upper hand because you know what I'm saying I'm wrestling and what not. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7651.96s)]
*  And I remember I had to a punch he blocked to hit me dead in my chest right. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7655.0s)]
*  I'm like ooh caged me in. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7658.12s)]
*  I ended up wrestling him. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7660.04s)]
*  I was like I wrestle I'm gonna go ahead take a shot on him. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7661.16s)]
*  Soon as I took a shot on him because that was the only thing I was good at was a double leg right. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7663.48s)]
*  That man powe driving he grabbed my hip like this picks me up boom slams. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7667.16s)]
*  He's like ready to get back in the car you know what I'm saying. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7671.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh you ready to get in the car? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7673.4s)]
*  I was like oh yeah yeah I'm good bro I ain't trying to fight you no more you know what I mean. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7674.2s)]
*  So but the reason why I bring that up is because like I realize I'm almost just like this dude [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7677.8s)]
*  right you know I never met him you know what I'm saying just that fighter mentality that fighter [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7682.84s)]
*  will like you know I mean that's where I get that from and it's crazy that even then at that time [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7686.12s)]
*  I never gave him a chance unfortunately and without me giving him a chance and not getting [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7691.24s)]
*  to actually know him I ended up losing him as well you know what I'm saying. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7697.16s)]
*  So I ended up losing my mom and my dad but the thing is I never even got a chance to even [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7700.76s)]
*  try to talk to him and get to know him because I never like actually went up about the opportunity [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7705.08s)]
*  to talk to him and speak to him because he was almost like a big brother to me because we both [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7710.679999999999s)]
*  living with my grandpa which is his dad you know so I felt like it was more like a big brother [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7714.599999999999s)]
*  relationship between me and him you know and when I lost him you know and I didn't get the [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7719.56s)]
*  opportunity actually uh experience him like I should have you know by the time I wanted that [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7724.92s)]
*  he was already gone you know. But I mean it's going as a teenager and just meeting him for the first [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7729.64s)]
*  time you can't put that on you I mean you know yeah I was like because I ain't been gonna call [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7736.52s)]
*  this man daddy or nothing you know. That's hard that's so hard. No big fact man. Did you call him by his first name? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7742.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah yeah so I call him Marcus. Wow that's weird enough as it is right? I mean not at all because [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7750.12s)]
*  it's how I knew. Right. You know Marcus like that you know everybody used to call him jug [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7756.44s)]
*  too that was his nickname and stuff like that so yeah yeah so like I said once but that's the crazy [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7760.44s)]
*  part then like once um just growing up around him like for and it was only like a year time too [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7765.48s)]
*  it was only about like a year where we was able to like actually be in the same household and [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7771.8s)]
*  actually speak to one another but everything that he used to do I'd be like there's certain things [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7776.04s)]
*  that I did as well that I was always wondering where I get it from you know and I got exactly [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7779.4s)]
*  from him like we moved the same we talked the same we walked the same and I was like this is my first [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7783.56s)]
*  time really like meeting this man. That had to be weird. Yeah it was a little weird though I ain't [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7787.88s)]
*  gonna lie I ain't gonna lie you know uh but it made sense though you know where it came from. Yeah [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7791.56s)]
*  completely yeah yeah well all those things are that's a part of character that's a part of what [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7796.92s)]
*  makes you who you are I mean I think people that come from an easy life have a very difficult time [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7801.64s)]
*  making in the world of fighting yeah yeah yeah it's it's very it's not the same I mean people [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7807.64s)]
*  have done it you know the people that come from good households and good families. BJ Penn? Yeah [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7813.240000000001s)]
*  BJ Penn well George St. Pierre I mean George St. Pierre was bullied when he was young and that's [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7817.72s)]
*  what got him into martial arts but he had a very good relationship with his parents yeah yeah but [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7822.92s)]
*  having a rough childhood is almost like a prerequisite to being a great fighter so many [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7827.4s)]
*  fighters come from like dark times. Yeah big fights I mean like I said like your experiences alone can [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7832.5199999999995s)]
*  prepare you for fights you know I mean and that's what makes some of the best fighters in the world [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7838.36s)]
*  you know but I feel like with everything that I went through I guess it I guess you could say [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7841.96s)]
*  preparing me for fighting but it really showed me and this is where I'm trying to get to you know [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7847.719999999999s)]

*  he was dealing with of course you know yeah of course unfortunately you know so many people are [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7890.28s)]
*  dealing with so much I mean that's uh that's this fucking crazy dance of life and your your dance is [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7894.5199999999995s)]
*  very crazy and that makes sense now knowing your childhood while you're so ferocious inside the [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7901.08s)]
*  octagon I didn't think about it like that I didn't think about it like that the life experiences that [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7906.92s)]
*  you've had yeah I mean it is it is a major factor in what forms a man's personality and the what [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7911.4s)]
*  you've gone through those trials and tribulations you can't substitute that yeah yeah somebody that [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7919.879999999999s)]
*  has that or they don't there's a fire that some dudes have and you have it I appreciate a lot of [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7925.16s)]
*  that comes from just bad times yeah yeah and and also man it's just like when I see that right [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7929.5599999999995s)]
*  with my mom passing when my dad passes it's like you know the only people that know that are the [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7936.44s)]
*  people that's closest to us right you know I'm saying and my thing was like I just always wanted [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7940.2s)]
*  to leave my name here and print it somehow some way in some type of fashion you know [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7944.599999999999s)]
*  because it's a fun little quote you know I mean that uh that that like I don't know who said it [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7950.44s)]
*  but they was like you know you die twice you know I mean uh the first time you die is when you you [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7954.599999999999s)]
*  know take your last breath and the second time you die is when they say your name for the last time [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7958.84s)]
*  and that always spoke volumes to me because like I was like man I want my name to be remembered [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7962.76s)]
*  some way you know and uh that that was my real pursuit for real for real [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7966.68s)]
*  at doing like MMA and chasing my dream leave your mark leave my mark yeah some way well you [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7972.04s)]
*  definitely have that opportunity I mean you've already left your mark but you have an opportunity [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7977.400000000001s)]
*  you're only 28 right yeah you have a giant future ahead of you because we work especially knowing [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7981.96s)]
*  your background now like and knowing how little real formal training you've had and the fact that [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7987.88s)]
*  you've reached this level of proficiency and skill and accomplishment it's pretty crazy I mean [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7994.2s)]
*  you're in a really great spot right now especially now dropping down to 170 pounds which is your [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=7999.5599999999995s)]
*  natural weight class where you're not going to be at a disadvantage physically like in the Nordine [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8005.0s)]
*  fight yeah so I mean but I think everything plays a part you know me and everything happens for a [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8009.16s)]
*  reason so I'm glad I fought at 185 I'm glad I was able to develop my name you know saying in the [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8015.0s)]
*  middleweight division and stuff like that because it's not gonna make it harder to go down to 170 [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8019.8s)]
*  and fight right a couple other you know rank good names instead of starting all the way back over [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8024.68s)]
*  well you know fight guys like Imamov who's like what is his natural weight I mean what is he [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8029.08s)]
*  walking around I don't know he probably 215 yeah who knows much much bigger yeah and Nasruddin is [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8032.84s)]
*  I mean he's like he's an elite level fighter that way too yeah so you have I fought I mean be honest [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8037.96s)]
*  with you when I look at my resume at uh 185 I ain't fighting no bombs no I ain't fighting no [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8042.92s)]
*  bombs no no so I fought a lot of uh you know high level guys at middleweight and I did a successful [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8047.56s)]
*  job you know I took a couple else here and there but you know I was able to accomplish you know [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8052.4400000000005s)]
*  get five wins uh up to four knockouts yeah then the middleweight division you know and I think [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8056.84s)]
*  that should speak volumes for me to go to a weight class that's more fitted for me much yeah much [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8061.96s)]
*  better much better for you and also with this structured training and the fact that you really [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8067.400000000001s)]
*  do have relatively little in comparison the amount of time you've been fighting yeah yeah I mean well [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8073.24s)]
*  I've been fighting for a long time yeah you know for 10 years but I just didn't know nothing right [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8078.2s)]
*  but that's that's what's so crazy it's like you and you've accomplished a lot with that right and [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8083.0s)]
*  now having very structured training and being in your physical prime and going down to a natural [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8088.599999999999s)]
*  weight class I mean once you get past Chris Curtis if you get past Chris Curtis you know [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8094.12s)]
*  you know it's no no but it's just that when I'm Italian me like like you know it's like this is [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8100.04s)]
*  all the preparation that I've been putting in and doing and um just taking the time and opportunity [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8104.68s)]
*  to actually promote the fight for for myself you know I mean coming out here with you and speaking [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8109.88s)]
*  to you you know I mean to sell this fight even that you know I just I just developed too much [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8113.8s)]
*  time and effort into this fight to lose I can't you know because everything that I want on the [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8118.4400000000005s)]
*  other side is riding up to this fight it ain't even like the national team fight like this the [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8124.76s)]
*  fight right here right you know I mean so the last fight that I got uh uh not on my contract [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8128.68s)]
*  but of the year because this would be my fourth fight that I had you know I'm saying within one [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8133.240000000001s)]
*  year you know and that's a big deal to me and I feel like I really need to show out for this one [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8136.76s)]
*  you know because I've never been a fighter either to lose back to back because I at least like if [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8141.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not learning in the gym I'm learning from those fights trust me I think you did learn from [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8146.04s)]
*  that fight and what you're talking about with that third round that you should have fought that way [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8151.320000000001s)]
*  in the first round isn't that a big part of the whole experience of having high level competition [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8154.5199999999995s)]
*  is these little little lessons that you learn each individual encounter and they measure you [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8159.639999999999s)]
*  know even though they're small they make for major adjustment uh major improvements that's what I mean [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8164.5199999999995s)]
*  to say you know so having that fight with nasa deen is showing that I need to put the gas on a lot [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8168.839999999999s)]
*  of these dudes early period you know and uh make them work you know so I didn't make nasa deen work [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8173.5599999999995s)]
*  as hard as I should have in that first and that second round you know now what kind of strength [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8179.0s)]
*  and conditioning routine do they have you on because you have such a wild style of fighting [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8183.64s)]
*  I mean you have to have a deep deep gas tank to fight I got a psychopath man as a conditioning [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8189.240000000001s)]

*  not be like the craziest things that i'm doing but i'm doing the same thing consistently right [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8631.88s)]
*  having no job has to be a big factor oh yeah going from you know having a job and training [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8636.28s)]
*  when you can to having training being your whole job big fact because like i said i'm not doing [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8642.44s)]
*  nothing crazy or special just able to do it every day you know there's so many fighters that fight [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8647.640000000001s)]
*  at a world-class level that still have a job it's crazy i mean that's just the sport that we in [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8652.04s)]
*  yeah you know but my thing i was it is it is unfortunate but i've been blessed and i've been [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8657.08s)]
*  fortunate enough to like be able to fight the way i'm fighting and i've been rewarded for it [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8663.4s)]
*  you know so you know i feel like a lot of fighters if they put more on the line and they go out and [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8668.2s)]
*  actually try to take a little bit more risk they could potentially you know be on the other side [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8673.08s)]
*  but at the same time it's all about winning you know what i mean uh but unfortunately you see some [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8677.48s)]
*  guys that win some fights whatever but they're not exciting they're not fun and you don't see [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8682.12s)]
*  where their career takes them and they don't make a lot of money which you see like they like you [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8687.64s)]
*  said they got another job they still training they still you know trying to find sponsors [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8691.08s)]
*  whatever just to pay some certain bills and stuff like that you know so it's that risk and reward [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8694.92s)]
*  factor you know so if you're willing just to win but not be exciting you know i mean just realize [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8699.16s)]
*  like you're not going to get the money that you really looking for and you're gonna have to i [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8703.32s)]
*  guess that's the harder route i feel like you know unfortunately it's interesting like that those [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8706.6s)]
*  calculations like are you just trying to win are you trying to win and be someone who's very [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8711.24s)]
*  entertaining right big facts and i feel like you know a lot of guys don't train that way and i've [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8716.039999999999s)]
*  been training like that for a long time you know and i wouldn't even say like i'm a hard guy to [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8720.68s)]

*  dudes out you know and i feel like some guys in the mma culture whatever they just want to touch [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8734.68s)]
*  like man i don't really want to hurt you know it's a dude so we're just going to touch like this and [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8739.800000000001s)]
*  just tag each other but i feel like that that plays a part in your fights too you know and a [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8743.56s)]
*  lot of guys get touched up even more because of that in a fight instead of actually taking it [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8747.88s)]
*  serious and sparring because they're not used to sparring hard exactly right so now they're getting [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8752.519999999999s)]
*  touched up for real in the actual fight you know how do you balance that out though because if you [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8758.599999999999s)]
*  spar too much you leave too much in the gym well how many times did i tell you i i spar in a week [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvpcMhqkjOk&t=8763.08s)]
