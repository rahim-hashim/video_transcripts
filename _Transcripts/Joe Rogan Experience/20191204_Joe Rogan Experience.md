# JRE MMA Show #84 with Brendan Schaub
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frw-IBgu-Qw)
*  You
*  A lot of shit on this table. Yeah, this is tables ridiculous
*  I'm a mess and this table is reflecting of the busyness of my life right now
*  I need to take some time and clean this fucking table, but the thing is man people keep bringing me shit
*  But it's all damn shit. I love you, buddy, but you gave me a mushroom hat this hat is
*  That off
*  Wait, I don't know. Is this the way to wear it like this way. I think so
*  So people keep giving me cool shit, yeah gave me this mushroom
*  That's a dried mushroom people give me all this cool shit. And so I go. Oh, thank you
*  And I don't know where to put it set it down
*  I got a Dan ackroyd's vodka in the corner there cool skull vodka thing. God
*  I've never seen someone push vodka so hard on a pocket. Oh, he goes hard in the paint with his vodka sales great promotion
*  Very smooth and it's Dan ackroyd. So like I'll buy it just to let I want to hear you talk the Blues brother
*  I'm in dude. I bought man. I bought it. He was a conehead. He's he's one of the original
*  Saturday night live slayers like the real OG
*  Blues brother, yeah
*  Hey, man, we started this podcast off talking like off the record and I thought it was probably good for everybody here like when
*  I'm so happy you're not fighting, you know, and what we're saying was I know that I was a dick
*  To you to get you to stop doing it, but I felt I felt like there was almost no other way
*  that you were gonna let I felt like I
*  felt scared
*  I've seen too many people that are just there's this there's a moment where it changes
*  Where they stop being that person and they keep fighting and you see it you see the deterioration
*  And no one steps in and no one stops them and then I thought you'll talk to him alone man
*  Maybe you run into him in Vegas
*  Maybe you both have a couple of drinks you see each other at the bar and you're like, hey
*  How's things and you have these conversations and then the reality sets in things are not good for a lot of these guys a
*  Lot of these guys that have taken punishment for too long. There's no bringing them back man
*  they get to this spot where you know, everyone knows there's something wrong and no one says anything to them and
*  I
*  Was real scared that that was gonna happen to you I was real scared
*  You know, like I didn't anticipate when we did that crazy podcast that wound up being, you know, this like intervention
*  I didn't even know I was gonna do it
*  But while it was happening, I was like I this you got to stop. That's all I was thinking is you've got to get out
*  I was high
*  I don't even remember if we were drinking but we probably were
*  But I remember that being so sensitive to it like there's something has to be done like now you got it
*  You you had so many other possibilities that there's if like most guys that are all in on fighting
*  They don't have anything on the side. Like there's almost nothing else there. There's almost just fighting and maybe a family, right?
*  But you were you were starting to flourish. You're hilarious on podcasts. What you know that can go away
*  You guys come shells and
*  Right now now that you're out you see it, right?
*  Yeah, thank thank God or whoever's up there man for you and Brian Kellen. Thank fucking I know it came out
*  Dickie, I know it did and I know I apologize then and I apologize now
*  But I think that's the only way you could do it. I know you're gonna listen
*  I knew you you had this pride like you were like we were talking about before the show
*  Like we were talking about before the show you were a top ten professional
*  Heavyweight in the biggest organization in the world. That's a that's a identity thing too, man
*  That like you people get strapped into that identity
*  That's one of the harder things about fighters is when you quit you you have to find meaning in your life
*  Like what what are you good at now dude for me?
*  I know I never did anything professionally
*  But it was the formative stages of my life where the only thing that gave me any feelings of good
*  Was martial arts you feel like a loser the only thing the only thing everything else I felt even this
*  I was kind of good at drawing but even then I was like my drawing teacher didn't like me
*  I had friends that I was close within the class. We all drew and we liked our stuff
*  But man, I felt like a fucking loser except for martial arts. So when I quit and
*  Then I'm just doing comedy and I suck at comedy
*  I was eating shit and I was like what am I quitting for like I'm quitting something that I was good at to be something
*  That I suck at that I maybe think I have this pipe dream that I could eventually make a living out of I
*  Remember that feeling of not having an identity and obviously when you're 21, no one has an identity anyway
*  You're always so so fucking confused in your head. You're trying to figure it out
*  I was super fortunate where I was surrounded by guys like you
*  Callan Bert Tom and it's just like where I wanted to be in that party
*  I was I was so fortunate the stars aligned for me where I was at this party over here
*  And guys were getting CT and you know, you're fighting and it's a fucking grind and then you guys were over here
*  I'm like, well, I want to be one of them. I'm good, man. I'm good. I want to do that
*  Yeah, and I think it took that bridge in that gap you and to be honest
*  I think that would that's the only way that you could have done it because the the ego that I had at the time
*  Especially fighting man getting to that level
*  It was like that egos insane the narcissist and the the dream of I can beat Kane or steep a these guys
*  And I think the only way that I could have bridged that gap is by you going so hard in the paint
*  You know, I was so scared about in Ghana. I was so scared. They were gonna fight you with in Ghana or someone like that
*  You know what I mean? I
*  Was so scared you were gonna get murked by some some when you weren't all-in anymore. Yeah
*  those big fucking when you watch like when when
*  Francis murked over him with that left hook cut Jesus Christ
*  Like if that was you and I was calling that fight man, dude, it would be and I love Alistair
*  He's a great guy. I have a deep appreciation for him as a fighter. I mean, I'm yeah and my feeling was
*  When he came over as k1 Grand Prix champion, like this is the most celebrated striker
*  We've ever had and in my man you saw it in his fight with Brock Lesnar phenomenal, dude. He people man
*  That one of the things that makes that Francis chaos so fucking crazy insane
*  I mean this he did the same thing to Junior dos Santos. Remember over him did it
*  Yep, he hit him with a beautiful left hook very similar punch
*  Super worried about that with you man, but but I also I also think too for me it was like this
*  quick
*  Ascension into into this UFC and I'm fighting these top 10 top 15 guys. I'm in this I'm in this world
*  but it's like I was almost like a cheat code because I
*  Was really athletic I was really really athletic with my background so I got I passed a lot of guys fast my athleticism
*  But then you get to a certain point where you're fighting these vets where they've they fought big powerful athletic guys before but then it comes
*  Down to experience and technique and that's always always gonna win nine times out ten
*  That's always gonna win
*  The thing is about striking too is like striking when you mix in with wrestling
*  You can kind of get away with a lot more a lot more crazy shit happens people knock people out
*  That maybe wouldn't knock people out normally
*  You know like Kevin Randleman was an amazing example that he knocked out Mirko croak off of the left hook
*  Remember that yeah, if they were in a straight kickboxing match
*  It's definitely possible that Kevin could do that Kevin was an incredible athlete
*  But you would favor heavily that Mirko would be able to stuff that all day all day most likely
*  Because he was so elite in that realm, but you add
*  Striking to MMA and you know
*  There's like there's so much craziness going on that sometimes it's hard for people to clearly establish like who's actually better on their feet
*  Until someone can stop the craziness. Yeah, there's a good line. Yeah, and then you get to this level
*  There's this level we get like a Mazda doll. He's a perfect example because he's so goddamn good
*  He's so smart. He's so technical and he finds these openings that maybe other people don't see or maybe they can't get to where those openings
*  Are and he finds those so you think you're doing good you think you're doing good, but he's waiting
*  He's waiting for the moment where he sees this spot that he's been looking at and boom
*  He cracks Darren till with that step in left hook and puts him out
*  You put a fucking animal like Darren till alcohol come on
*  I think John's one of those guys to like we kind of because of his last few opponents and was like God
*  Maybe he's already lost a step. I watch it. I go. Oh, he's playing with his food. He's playing with his food
*  I'm not disrespecting those guys who he's father Don McRae's who he's gonna fight
*  But for John you look at his legacy and the legends that he's fought
*  It's tough for him to get up for the challenge. So he's playing with his food right now. Well wait till he fights
*  I'm telling you wait till he goes to heavyweight
*  You're gonna see the old John when he when when there's actual where he thinks it's a challenge wait till you see him fight a steep
*  Air Francis you're gonna see the the monster come out and I just pick him with this food. Yeah, I'll do that
*  All right, yeah, let's do it. I think I think he's in cruise control
*  I think you're entirely correct and I think when you are at that elite a level when you've never been defeated you have one loss
*  It's a bullshit loss. Everybody knows it's a bullshit loss. He really should get his record cleaned
*  That should be something that you have mean they cleared him with this whole picogram shit
*  They found out that this is we just have this new ability to measure
*  Substances in the most minuscule amounts that it's so ridiculous that just some random
*  Sort of
*  Vitamin that has some contaminant one one millionth of a fucking gram or whatever the other dick pill or protein
*  Shit test positive. That's not a drug. It's not like someone's cheating
*  It's just so they cleared him on that right you saw it makes this whole
*  Statement about the the new way they're viewing this stuff because the fact their equipment's just amazing. You can't hide from
*  Usada though. I like that you saw it went. Yeah, it's so good
*  We're gonna back off yeah, and I like that they learn from it I love it
*  I love that they did the same with marijuana
*  They realized like we were not dealing with a performance enhancer. So I was these guys aren't fighting high
*  It's just like I'll help them sleep and relax not hurt. It's not helping anybody in terms
*  It's like not making them stronger faster
*  So and it might help them with anxiety and a lot of other things so they they released that right?
*  They're doing good things, but with John it's cleared that he wasn't taking anything. This is just some some shit
*  That's a residual
*  Like a residue that's on something else some contaminated supplement same thing would happen with Tim means Tim means got busted the same way
*  They mean they dragged it out with him for months
*  There's a lot of guys when he was at his peak really I know when he was peeking in the UFC
*  He's one of the most interesting welterweights all of a sudden boom he gets a suspension from
*  Tainted supplements you look at the guy. He's not a fucking steroid dude. How about Tom Waller?
*  Yes, kind of lost his career Josh Barnett. I know same thing people are upset, but if you're you sorry like yes
*  We don't like tell you dude like we're trying to move forward and get better right it sucks for those guys
*  And I feel so terrible for those guys, but if you saw they like our bat we learned though, man
*  There's nothing the thing is you saw that has a long career
*  You know when you got a guy like Tim means or a guy like Josh Burnett. There's a window
*  Josh has had an extremely long window obviously youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion the longest
*  But that extremely long window
*  I mean it's gonna come to a close and they took away a large chunk of it for something turned out to not be accurate
*  But they're gonna last a long time with these guys like they say that like at their peak
*  The best fighters have nine years at their peak. That's a long time. It's a long time
*  The only guys really hit that nine-year stride at peak form. I think is like Anderson Fador
*  There's like a few like real legends GSP obviously GSP John John
*  obviously right John is
*  Undefeated right now. I mean they took his title away wins it back right
*  Never never lost a title fight and you're dealing with the guy wins the title youngest ever in the sport
*  Flying knee opener on Shogun had just nothing but success since then people are like inspecting him with a mic as well
*  Expecting him to fall off like you're dealing with the goat man. It's hilarious
*  He's the goat and even after the Santos fight my god Santos had one leg
*  So I went back and watched John Jones fight and you watch you're like, oh he's in he couldn't give two fucks about being in
*  Well, he was smart too because he's smart
*  It's dangerous. But at the same time he could have took him down his coaches like dude
*  I was talking his manager like we were like dude take him down. He's like now
*  I'm gonna say this anyone it's hard for him to take because you look at the resume of guys
*  He's beat and then they're like again. It's not a knock on Dom McRae. It's not a knock on Corey Anderson or
*  Anthony Smith, but like here's Anthony Smith and John's like
*  All right, yeah, let's do it man, so it's you know that he's fucking with his food right now
*  Well, he's so good
*  But he's still able to fight out like the Gustafson fight the early one
*  The first one was a perfect example of him falling into a trap, right?
*  Partying too hard didn't train train for two weeks or barely right everyone campus like they were like saying what what do we do here?
*  He goes out and guts it out wins in the stretch
*  Wins down the stretch like he had to be pushed to win down the stretch, right?
*  Then I train with Gusman for that fight and I'm talking the best I've ever seen in the training room
*  I was like imagine. Oh this guy's never gonna lose. Yeah. Oh, he's the best
*  I've ever seen he would spar five rounds with me then jump in with a heavyweight professional boxer and fuck him up
*  5555 about beat the fuck out of me and I'm like what he's never gonna lose
*  John didn't you not understand? Yeah didn't train didn't train with the distance and one down the stretch
*  One down stretch gutted it out that and Gusman's the best light heavyweight of all time if he was in a different era
*  And there's no DC or John Jones. He's the goat, but you can't say that's how good he is
*  He's the goat if those two fucking guys aren't there. Yeah, you might be right close to being the goal of them, right?
*  He could this fucking close good with the first fight. Yes, but then the second fight John just runs him over
*  Because John took it serious very serious. I wanted to prove. Oh, he's good. Check this out. Yeah, how about the DC fight?
*  All right, beat you in decision. That's cool. Run it back. Boom. Okay head kick
*  Yeah, and I'm not just a head kick but head kick on the side where DC said you're not gonna trick me into leaning towards
*  My right where you could hit me with that left kick. Like they actually had a conversation about it the goat
*  Here's what's interesting about this is light heavyweight is so I wish I just wish John would dip out and be like you guys do
*  Build the no no no no no no, I like what he's doing. Well, no, he's defending it sure but here's here's the thing
*  He he's not stimulated by that. He's talking shit to the middleweight champion the world
*  He's busy talking shit to is Israel's talking shit to him too. That's they're having a lot of it's entertaining
*  Yeah, they're having a lot of fun. Listen, ultimately, I think it's good for everybody
*  I think that's the that little feud between Izzy and John Jones
*  Elevates Izzy because all these people that didn't know who he was like, why is John Jones talking shit? Oh, look at this mother fucker
*  Holy shit, he's good. And then they watch his fights ago
*  This is why John Jones talking shit to him because he's starched Robert Whitaker
*  Basically the end of the first round the fight was over. Oh, I mean Robert Whitaker was fucks bill and then he's
*  Dude and his social media. He's like everywhere. He's good everywhere. How about this great guy the best
*  Great guy love them. Love them honest as fuck. You know, I bought a McLaren 720s
*  Yes, he did. When he told me that was dude. I gave him a hug. I was so excited for him
*  I thought it was a car guy goes I can be honest man. I just bought it cuz it looked like this anime character
*  I went all right. Well, you got the right car. Is it on the right side?
*  I when I know a car is awesome, but it's got a steering wheel on the wrong side. I'm like, I know
*  I saw this incredible Porsche they had like this
*  1972 RS but it had the steering wheel on the right-hand side of my cat out of here with that
*  Wrong side what's crazy is Izzy told me they actually offered the fight to him already
*  Do you know that cheese and he was smart? He's smart cuz he went oh, no, you're not gonna canelo me
*  Floyd made with a canel me you're trying to get me while I'm really young in the game. No, no, no
*  We're doing two years. We're doing two years in Vegas. Yeah
*  Beautiful car man. That's not one the other day. They sound good, too
*  It's a spaceship inside. Mmm. They're beautiful man. That's a beautiful car. It's a great fucking he's special man
*  I think he's gonna be the next big superstar. I really do. He's got everything going for him
*  Talent great personality. He's fun. I mean he fights with as much skill as we've ever seen a striker
*  I mean, he's Anderson Silva 2.0
*  He really is man his striking is out of this fucking world man, but he has all the skills Anderson had but he's amazing on the mic
*  Yeah, terrible on the mic. Well, you know, I
*  Lose and it's like a fun of it though. No, it's almost like well don't talk but he was so good
*  It didn't matter agree like Anderson was so good
*  It didn't matter if we didn't understand we said everybody loved him man
*  Cuz he was it was like he was the goat at the time also
*  But also that the games different now it's so much of a specter like entertainment
*  Yeah, where I'd answer still be Anderson, but it was different back then we were more
*  Appreciative of those guys. Yes. I feel like I don't know
*  Maybe the fan base understood the sport more because like GSP was huge not a great shit talker
*  Anderson Silva not a great shit like we love those guys Cain Velasquez terrible time never talk shit
*  Those were those were the big boys, yep. Yep. GSP is a perfect example. Nothing but nice always never talk shit
*  No, no never max Holloway me to max talk a little shit, but it's more playful. Yeah, like we'll see
*  We'll see but stop and it really doesn't talk shit unless you initiate it if you initiate it game match
*  Oh, it's a it's a devastator
*  And he's good
*  He likes people that
*  Him and John Jones going back and forth, it's kind of fucking it's good for both of them
*  It's great for Izzy because if John is that concerned about him everybody's got to realize like oh this guy's for real
*  And I always say I want to entertain it when people bring it up. I go is he too small
*  It's just a fucking it's nothing. It's like Bigfoot whenever gonna see it get out of a big difference
*  There's a big difference, but is he's fucking big man when he walked up
*  I've never met him before when he walked up went damn, dude, you are not small
*  No, but he's only about 200 or so pounds
*  205 somewhere
*  Three I think yeah, he's in that range John's probably
*  235 right now right and John has two brothers that are elite NFL athletes pro ball. I mean bro he comes from
*  Fantastic genetics. I mean he's just got super athlete family. They're just and he's huge
*  Size difference is so big like could you see Izzy is a heavyweight? I don't know no no he would be overblown
*  It would be too hard for him to deal with the really big guys
*  I know they swear it's gonna happen though is he loves it he says gonna go up to heavyweight John Jones
*  Izzy's gonna go up. Yeah, he's gonna go up to heavyweight. He's down for what he's like. I don't care man
*  He doesn't care well. He's so good technically
*  I mean who knows man
*  Maybe he's doing specific kinds of training that keeps his body light and maybe if he lifted weights who'd actually get better
*  The only thing that would worry me about that fight, and I'd be rooting hard for Izzy in that fight
*  But the only thing that worries me is John's wrestling
*  Oh, yeah, man you forget how good remember took down DC and Olympia's he wanted to make a point first round
*  So if he wants to play that game
*  He can play it but John can do everything and when he does one thing he does better than anybody that's ever ever fought
*  Utilize distance he utilizes distance better than anybody
*  He's the very best at keeping you here and a lot of people accuse him of poking people in the eyes there have been some
*  Incidents, I don't think he's doing it on purpose. I think and I agree with you
*  He shouldn't do it. He should close his fist, but what I'm saying is the way his style is
*  He keeps you out here, and then bang keeps you out here back
*  It's a side kick to the leg oblique kick leg kick pops you with a jab hits you with a knee keeps you here
*  Keeps you here. These are his antennae. Yeah, dude. Just feeling out like a snake's tongue
*  Yeah, he's got space like this much space where he could fuck you up, but you can't hit him
*  He's got this because he's he's also he's so comfortable in world championship fights
*  He said nothing but world championship. That's all he knows
*  Yes, so when you're at the top of the food chain with the bright lights main event and you're like, holy shit
*  This is the big one John's like this is a fight
*  All his fight another day are like this another day in the office how Tyson was when Tyson was crushing people
*  That's how Anderson was when Anderson was crushing people thrive in the light and they get to this point where your you have to be
*  So much better to beat them because your shit in your pants going in your compromise and you're fighting a guy who's at the peak
*  He's in the zone. I mean Anderson like when he fought Stefan Bonner in Brazil, remember that shit, dude
*  He was in the zone man when he fucked up Forrest Griffin. He was in the zone
*  There was this zone where Anderson was when he front kick Vitor in the face. There was Anderson for a few years
*  It was like holy shit. Holy fuck people forget
*  It's hard when you look at it retroactively
*  You got to go back and understand the times we were living in we're talking about 2005 2006
*  Do you remember when he first came on like we knew of him in pride if you were hardcore you know of him in pride
*  But you didn't know like how good he is and then they go. Hey Chris Liebman. We got something for you
*  Chris Liebman goes I'll fight him. Yeah, and Chris Liebman had that noggin that head so you take punches and
*  Fucking Anderson Silva
*  Let that dude up. You're like what the fuck is happening right now
*  I have friends that bet on fights and that was one of them when I said listen to me bet the house on the Brazilian
*  I mean bet the house
*  Video how about big nog was like nah, you gotta keep going dude crazy. He was he was fighting over in cage warriors
*  I remember when he fought Jorge Rivera and cage wars and let Jorge punch him in the face
*  Oh, that's right. Let him stood right in front of him. Let him punch him in the face
*  Let him punch from this face. He smiles at him and kicks his ass and stops him, dude
*  He fucked everybody up over there man when he fucked up Lee Murray
*  Oh my god Lee Murray was murking people with one punch people forget to whoa Lee Murray was problems
*  That guy could crack rob a bank horrible yeah Rob a lot of banks. Yeah, shut up Rob. Yeah
*  No jail for life son. Oh, they gave him life. He's gonna be in there forever
*  They don't even know where the money is they're missing like 50 million dollars. It's goddamn Guy Ritchie movie
*  I know isn't Guy Ritchie making a movie about that on Lee Murray
*  Here's a little thought people don't know Lee Murray came into prominence because he got in a street fight with Tito Ortiz
*  Lodell was there but Chuck didn't fight him though, right?
*  What he was fighting his other friends, but the rumor is is Lee Murray starts Tito
*  Well, the would you was that he hit him? Yeah, I knew that he hit him
*  But I think Tito had I'm not making excuses for anybody
*  But I think what I heard is Tito had like dress shoes on like
*  I talked to Chuck about it and he goes here's no one got knocked out. It was a scuffle. No, he separated
*  He was that's what I Chuck hates Tito. He goes, but I'm not gonna right spread the rumor. He didn't get knocked out
*  No, I heard he got punched Tito's fighting this weekend. By the way. Yeah, who's he fighting?
*  Some guy who got wore a mask and got destroyed by crow cop. Oh that guy that guy
*  Remember that guy I was like, I'll try it out, but I'm gonna wear a mask down under the mask, dude
*  It's like a movie. It's a horror movie. It was a horror movie get that dos carros
*  Get the KO from Mirko crow caught versus dos carros
*  Mirko hits him with left kick cemetery right to the fucking dome and when the dude goes out as he slumps blood is dripping
*  Out of the inside of the mask across his eye. It's a horror movie
*  But it's like if you're gonna if Tarantino was gonna film this you like come on, bro
*  You're like, come on the bloods dripping down after the mask watch this fucking first of all the Japanese people are so mean
*  Here it is. It's right when he gets him up against the corner is when he lands this let it let it roll here a little
*  Bit he cracks him a few times just to let him know
*  This guy's a wrestler by making a huge mistake
*  You fucked up so bad because this guy has no business being in there and Mirko at the time is the peak
*  He's the best kickboxer we had ever seen in the sport at that time in the heavyweight division
*  This was like Alistair was still not Alistair back then, you know, he had made it Mirko was the first
*  He was the first real K one superstar because he was explosive
*  Like a lot of the guys like Ernesto Hust and maybe Peter Earth's they maybe wouldn't have made the transition to me
*  Mirko did Mirko was like oh
*  One shot. Oh now watch when they close up on him watch watch when they close it on me see the blood
*  These fucks yeah, they try to rip the mask off see if I get those caros boy
*  I hope didn't make up the blood part. I don't think I did no blood comes out. It's right
*  It's when they're trying to get it off. Yeah. Okay, so when they go back to the dude
*  Okay, there's blood but let me see where the blood comes out of they don't they show it dripping maybe I saw it on a photo
*  It's hard. I remember seeing it too
*  But it might be one of those things like the Berenstein Bears where everybody remembers it wrong, you're right
*  No, they got blood that there's obviously some bleeding on his head because they're they're cleaning it up
*  But I remember seeing him slumped and then the blood trickles down. Hey, what the fuck was that guy thinking fighting?
*  I had that trip the Japanese. Okay, what the fuck were they? No, what was he thinking? Oh, man, dudes are
*  They this idea like they can just do it Oh to be fine. Oh, what's the big deal?
*  It's Murko I've been in a fight before. Oh my god, dude, you knock that guy out. I know
*  How about that haters?
*  God we just kicked kiss his ass
*  Brendan knocked him out. Yeah
*  He had a he was still doing the damn thing to grow his
*  Hard of
*  Vanderlei Silva is one of the most horrific in the sport the best because that was two fights
*  There's one his first fight with mixed martial arts rules like modified rules
*  Remember you could only go to the ground for like X amount of seconds
*  There's some weird rule and if it went to the distance, it would be a draw
*  So the fight went to the distance. So then after that Murko has a series of fights with high-level competition
*  It gets way better at sprawling also brings Dean Lister into his camp for doom as well for doom
*  So he gets real comfortable with jujitsu real comfortable grappling is working with these elite guys
*  Powerful wrestlers the whole deal then they have the second fight the second fights in the heavyweight tournament and vandalize on all
*  The Mexican
*  That's the best man LA the berserker
*  Find that Murko crow cop versus vandalis Silva, too
*  It's a great fight and vandali got bigger than crow cop vandali weight if I remember correctly
*  I may be wrong, but I think I'm right
*  Vandali weight 218 and
*  Crow cop weight 214. I think vandali was actually heavier than the lay of pure Brazilian
*  I was right about that if I really remember those numbers great great mind
*  Vandalis Silva. I know we had an issue. Sorry while we were talking the was that the whole thing go down or just the TVs
*  Vandalis Silva versus Murko crow cop two
*  Because in that one that one Murko was fully comfortable with with MMA
*  He wasn't getting taken down in news vandali wasn't a rest take down offense was insane
*  He wasn't worried about being submitted either because he'd been training with Dean Lister and Fabricio Verduin
*  So he's just smart send in missiles
*  You know, he's the one who got Verduin into pride and into MMA
*  He brought for doom in for jiu-jitsu and the dooms like I was kind of cool. Wow, that's crazy. That's right
*  That's right before Verduin fought
*  Junior dos Santos remember when no one who dos Santos was and I think it was like a late-minute substitute
*  Yeah, late minute. Yeah and junior hit him with the uppercut
*  See see this is a second fight in the second fight vandali is facing a completely different animal because look at that shakes him off
*  Crow cop was physically strong as fuck. He was moving like a real MMA fighter
*  Who's also an elite kickboxer? It was a different animal. Look how big his legs dude. You weren't submitting him
*  You weren't submitting him he's been rolling with Fabricio Verduin so he he lets him up and he's just battering vandalina
*  So look at this straight left hand boom boom. I mean before the KO it's horrific, right?
*  He's beating the shit out of and the brakes up. Van de Lee is supposed to be fighting 185. That's his real weight class
*  He's just bulked up and you just can't hang with a guy
*  That's this fucking good as a heavyweight and so then vandali gets up
*  They give him a yellow card kick to the body and then sets up the big high kick to the head
*  I mean if vandali's trying man, he's swinging the ass swinging for he's swinging for the fences
*  He is but dude that fucking left kick to the forearms right there just numbed his arms
*  Boom, there's the head kick back up to the kick to the body back up before that
*  Watch this kick to the body dude, cuz you see vandali's arms
*  You know how when a dude gets shin slammed into the arms they have this like like look at that one right?
*  Yeah, oh my god, dude
*  I mean he's slamming it's he hitting forearm and gut and here's the high kick boom
*  So you eat a couple of those to your body or to your to your arms?
*  Everything just goes off. Everything is fucked up now and then he hits him with that high kick. Whoa
*  Shout out to crow cop shout out to crow cop like hospital left leg cemetery. Yeah, dude
*  but that was a
*  Perfect example of pride at its peak. You want to know how cocky I was when I was a fighter when we came out
*  You know the first thing I did I threw a high kick at crow cop
*  Yeah, I know I threw a head kick and he blocked and smiled like you
*  Just wanna let you know man hilarious
*  Dude how about fucking cowboy Connor? That's a very good fight
*  It's a long time overdue right? Perfect time for it too. Me too. I agree. I like how cowboys fighting now
*  He's so calm and relaxed in there. He's lost his last two but yeah, they were to the top, you know top of the heap
*  Yeah, I mean he fought Gagey who I think is the scariest fucking guy in the division right now
*  He scares me because Gagey's like he's it's like he's on a suicide mission
*  It's like either he's gonna go or you're gonna go and a lot of people say that but they don't really mean agree
*  He fucking means it and he's backed off of that a hair
*  So he's still
*  Controlled wildness if you say he's a brother. He does not like it. I don't think he necessarily is I think what he is
*  Oh, he's just he's wild but it's intelligent. It's controlled chaos
*  Yes, it's any better than ever and he has a great chin phenomenal wrestling
*  Those fights where didn't go his way because of the chaos
*  I think it's just making him be just a little bit more calculated agree just a little bit more cerebral
*  Do we fucked up Barbosa I was like Jesus
*  Because I thought they were Gagey's kind of left out in the cold with all these matchups being announced with Khabib Tony
*  Connor cowboy Khabib's kind of left out where he's just like alright the fuck we do now man
*  Yeah, Gagey is a little bit left out in the cold, but not really Khabib or Gagey
*  You said Gagey then you said could be but I know what you meant. Yeah
*  Gagey is a little bit left out. But if anybody gets injured, he's right in there
*  See like we're in this weird place where we're pretending these fights are all gonna happen
*  We hope we hope and pray dude don't think it could be even Tony
*  We hope and pray that cowboy and Connor actually make it to the dance, but they might not make it to dance
*  It's so somebody doesn't make it to the dance guess who gets a phone call Justin Gagey or Masvidal or Masvidal
*  But Masvidal is 170. He's got a saying for Connor. Oh for car
*  Cuz that fight, you know converse Cowboys at welterweight. Yes, which when it was first announced
*  I was like, oh at 55 man, that's tough fight for Cowboys slow starter
*  Connor's a finisher comes out the gates like a fucking banshee and then my brother text me this man
*  You know, it's that welterweight. Why the fuck would they do that? This Connor doesn't want to lose any weight
*  Listen, dude
*  I think that guy tortured himself to get down to 45 so hard and
*  When you looked at what he looked like when he was on the scale when he was flexing you looked like a goddamn zombie
*  Skeleton it's horrible
*  So I think you don't nobody you whether he complains or not about that nobody writes for free you do that to your body
*  For a couple of years you're doing some fucking damage and it makes it harder to lose the weight afterwards, right?
*  So then he's going up to 55
*  He's you know, he's obviously elite at 55 wins a title at 55 has the the great rematch with Diaz at 70
*  Right and then comes back and fights Khabib at 55 again and gets mauled. You know, he has a fight with
*  Cowboy you're gonna he's really a 55 that can fight welterweight. That's the right size for him versus
*  I don't think Nate is fighting 55 and anytime in the future. No, it's too big now
*  He's too big
*  But my only issue with at 70 and I assume his team
*  Decided to do it at 70 is when I look at Conor McGregor as a welterweight
*  Is his power the same as it was at 45 and 55 is his timing the same as speed?
*  No, he's fighting a guy who I think in his eyes is not really a welterweight you think oh 55
*  Or kids did most his work at 55 because he think I think he thinks of cowboy as the guy who fight at 170
*  But he's really a 55. That's fair. My only issue with that is
*  And I'm a huge Conor McGregor fan. I'll see Saroni's a
*  friend of mine, so I just wanted to have a great fight, but
*  When people were complaining about this fight when the Internet's like that's whatever to me
*  I think it's a phenomenal fight because I think if you're a cowboy fan
*  You know, I always said cowboy was too much of a company man
*  The UFC and Daniel cut weight dude fight this fight do this turn up quick turn around right cowboy
*  The the legend of cowboy was born. He's jumping out fucking ships and whatever the hell he's riding fucking bulls
*  And whatever the fuck he was doing the week of the fight
*  Yeah, and he was cutting kill himself to make weight and I just went does it ever work out for anybody who says?
*  He was a yes, man to the UFC not really
*  But now we've seen it's worked out for cowboy because this is his you know
*  I I don't put too much into titles anymore like this is Cowboys title shot
*  You got the biggest fight in the game you're fighting Conor McGregor you're making you're make millions of dollars
*  This is the golden goose when you talked if you talked to Kamara Usman Kobe Covington
*  Mazvadal Khabib Tony maybe not those two but it talked to anyone who do you want to fight everyone says Connor?
*  Because you know, it's the biggest fight you can get in the game
*  Cowboy got it by being he's paid his dues. He's earned it. He's getting millions of millions dollars win lose or draw
*  It's a good fight for cowboy. I think they should make a red panties night belt
*  I'd be cool whoever gets to fight Connor you get a red panties night belt
*  The belts like the belts are whatever now, you know
*  Cuz cuz like think about some like super hot actress to wear them for a day
*  Oh, dude, I would love that and they win those be so sick a belt with like
*  framed
*  Red panties and it be so dope
*  I think he's you know Connor's calculated in his comeback and I think this is a smart fight for him because he's not fighting someone
*  Who's too big right where I feel like you know
*  That was the argument about Nate even though Nate did of course fight at 55 for a long time a big dude
*  He's a big dude
*  You know, and then there's some other guys that want to fight him at 170 that are real 170s
*  Like Mazvadal is a perfect example that Mazvadal was a 155 for a long time
*  But he's not anymore if you look at his frame like you would go look at back when he fought like Michael Chiesa, which was like
*  2013
*  14 14 somewhere around then right so Mazvadal back then was like a skinny guy
*  Yeah, he was real skinny wasn't defined, you know wasn't a man yet almost well like he grew into his body
*  He was also killing himself to make 55 right and you can't pack on any weight
*  When he went up to 170 we get to see who he really is
*  We knew who he really was before me knocked out Eve Edwards and Bodog. Oh, it's cool. Remember that
*  Yeah, that was an Eve was a monster. He was probably the best 55 pounder in the world people forget about that
*  They do forget. Um, but I one of the reasons why I was trying to think why they would do it at 70
*  I think you're right where cowboy is the natural 155 is not a huge
*  Yeah, welterweight, but the other thing is is now that Connor fights at 70 now he has options
*  He can play in 70 and play at 55 right in 70 and I know his team wants to and his manager told me this
*  Mazvadal told me this they want to be the coma coma main event against Nick Diaz and they want the Connor fight
*  Is Nick taking fights? He announced on his Instagram. They have big news about a fight
*  On his Instagram story, I guess
*  Did you see his interview with Ariel? Yep. What'd you think?
*  What'd you think?
*  I didn't I didn't think you looked happy
*  No, I thought you know real troubled and a lot of rambling
*  I mean a lot of thoughts trying to get out of his head a lot of rants, you know
*  I mean, I I think I don't it's like but have you ever watched an interview and be like, oh damn that was
*  With him. Yeah, like that was super clear. I mean, I don't think that's his jam
*  You know his jam is fucking people. They talk about that him and Nate. They're just like yeah, it's a little I know
*  it's tough cuz
*  Cuz again, we kicked this podcast off with CT and stuff like that
*  So it's like is that a combination of him fighting? Is that what's going on there?
*  Those are the years of the wars or is that just right? Is that just him? We don't know
*  But I don't know him well enough, but I know guys
*  You know
*  That are in that same era. They're having real problems now time
*  I mean you gotta remember when he was fighting in strike force God you remember his fight with Paul Daly
*  How about a cyborg fight? How good was he man? So good. How about his Frank Shamrock fight? Holy fuck, man
*  It's a shame what happened with him and his brother in the UFC we didn't get enough of it
*  Well the big thing well Nate didn't get appreciated enough and after that he got fucked
*  Yeah
*  And I had always said that after the Connor fight one of the reasons why those fights were so big was Nate and for whatever
*  Reason no one was putting that together. I'm like this guy's a superstar people go crazy when they see him
*  Like this is not they're like a regular fight. He's real as fucking he smokes weed
*  Yeah, he's a stoner champion and then he says fuck you to the man
*  Yeah, even the vegans love him cuz he sometimes he follows a vegan check all the boxes for a lot of reasons
*  See he's like he's got so many good things and he's tough as shit and he'll fight anybody and he's been a veteran
*  He's been fucking fighting forever. He's had so many wars. Did you think of his fight against Masvidal?
*  We haven't talked in a long time. I know Masvidal so good man. He's so good
*  I thought Masvidal out of the three rounds
*  I thought it was best case for Nate to that they did that that doctor stopped the fight
*  Because I thought Masvidal was setting up to finish him and not in you know, Nate's never been finished
*  So he has been finished Josh Tom. Oh, that's right, but I'm saying, you know, it's it was going that way
*  Yeah, it was best case scenario. We could be like dude. What the fuck where he doesn't lose any of that, you know, right?
*  So I hear you into yeah
*  Well the Josh Thompson fight was more competitive up until the moment Josh landed that high kid, correct that high kid
*  It was a good fight Josh. I think Josh was still winning that fight
*  I have to go back and watch it was more competitive. It was more competitive this model if I didn't find it that
*  Come on didn't when they got the mic and went oh rematch went no, there's no way and when Dana was like, no
*  That's not happen. I was like, oh he it was certainly competitive in that Masvidal was in a fight
*  It wasn't like you ran him over. I mean they went no one's gonna hard rounds
*  But that first round was devastating Masvidal is fucking good, man
*  He's fucking smart
*  He sees things and he can act on things that other guys just they just either don't have the ability to or they don't throw
*  Themselves in the fire correctly like he does and then he gets out good his defenses on everything stand straight up, too
*  He's got a totally different style like when you see Masvidal stand like he's net
*  He's hardly ever crouching dude. He stands straight up
*  he's got so much confidence in his wrestling takedown defense and his striking and his his
*  Octagon IQ that when he puts it all together, he's able to fight with his best stand-up stance
*  You know, he's fighting like and he makes you aware very clear very quickly that you're in danger with his hands
*  He's throwing bombs at your fucking think about think about his experience man. Do you know the guys he's beaten?
*  So now it's here. So, you know when you talk to him, he's like the belt fuck the belt. I get the BMF title
*  He's like Colby and and Kamara are just that their third or fourth options for me man
*  They're I'm looking at Nick Diaz. I'm looking at Connor, you know, there's just he's like I don't care about the belt man
*  I see why he would say that but I think it would be a real shame if right now in his prime of primes
*  He didn't fight for the title. I just feel like he's so close and that would be he's huge right now huge
*  Huge. You wouldn't rather see him fight Nick or Connor?
*  No
*  Interesting no. Well, I want to see first no matter what Colby and Usman you and you're getting that. Yes
*  That's gonna see super excited about that. What I'll fight once that's done
*  I want Masvidal to fight for the title whoever's got the belt
*  I think if Masvidal and Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz don't fight on the undercarriage of self
*  No, I don't know if it's gonna fight if they
*  Idea I have no idea. I know they want it and his management said the UFC has reached out
*  Yeah to Nick and they're trying to figure that out if they do make that fight happen
*  I mean, of course, I'm gonna be excited to see it, of course
*  But my thoughts are that right now we're experiencing Masvidal in this very strange zone
*  Where you see fighters enter into it whether it's through this
*  Rededication or refocusing of his intent and his discipline, you know
*  He you know a story how we went and did that reality show he came back and was like he didn't have any food man
*  He's so this is fucking South American reality show. He had to go to this village and ask for food
*  He also said he got like he had time to like get out from and like sit back
*  Yes, think about everything going on. I was like, all right. This is what I want to do and then came back
*  I was like, let's do it man. Then just he became this superstar
*  And I I just you know when when when I meet those guys and you obviously I know their store and you get around them
*  You just I have this sense of just like I'm so happy for them
*  Like that that's why I talked about a Nick Diaz fight for Jorge and I I talked about a Conor McGregor fight because
*  You're not the title like tomorrow and Colby. They're not making real money man
*  You don't think that the Colby that Colby's gonna bring in a lot of people
*  No, what record would say he does it and I love Kobe's fantastic fighter, but as far as ticket sales and pay-per-views
*  No, let me tell you does from the UFC from the UFC this
*  Colby with one big win right now like see he hasn't fought in a while right fights Robbie Lawler before that it was a whole year
*  Yes, there hasn't been a lot of activity him and Dana hate each other
*  But his crazy shit talking with his $3 suit and his fucking MAGA hat and his bonus shippers if he gets through it, right?
*  Yeah
*  and the strippers if he gets through and he beats Kamaru Usman and
*  Any and it gets on the internet and it becomes like a thing he could be the next huge superstar
*  He knows what he's doing and you and I both know him. He's not like that guy at all. This is a fucking character
*  He's a really nice guy. He's smart as shit and his fucking discipline is unparalleled and people look at him with that stupid
*  Suit on and the MAGA hat and he's carry around Donald Trump jr's book
*  It's fucking amazing, dude
*  He's the he's got the best act the whole day ever put on in the UFC because he's got an act
*  All these other guys are talking shit. He's talking shit to a character playing game. He made a guy
*  He's playing games. You think he thinks that suit looks good
*  When I did a food truck with a
*  Like in between you could see me like
*  You don't have to do this man, we can just say no. No, it's cool
*  Strippers he goes. Can you uh, how about you know, I'd be fun if one of you massage
*  It's too funny you massage my shoulders she goes get the fuck out of here look at him sitting there with his book
*  Triggered with his fucking with his suit. He's so funny
*  The fucking hat is sorry close it on the hat
*  By Donald Trump. He went to the White House. Look at that when he was an interim chair. Oh
*  He's still the interim champ. Yes, you can't just take it from him
*  But what's interesting too is, you know, remember him and Mazel tov had
*  They were training partners, so there's a story there yes, but again, I think for my friends apparently yes, but also
*  Yeah, it's like a Andy Kaufman thing. So
*  But I just for Mazel to ride off in the sunset and be set up with his kids
*  I want to see him fight Connor see him fake fight Nick
*  I know he made a ton of loot for that last fight
*  He made a ton of loot for that last fight
*  So and it was a big success, right?
*  Everybody wanted to see that fight was big and I think Monsville's names never been brighter
*  Whoever wins the title do you think about the story of him versus Nick Diaz?
*  I love and it is going my little brother
*  Yeah, that's the most I've ever relayed to the Diaz brothers when he goes dude you beat my little brother cuz I have an older
*  Brother I was like, oh hell you get him. I'm in now, bro
*  Yeah, fuck him up in and people will love that too. I mean, it'll definitely be successful
*  But I would like to see Nick be real active before that's not happening brother a guy like Mazel. I know I know you're right
*  You're right
*  That's what's crazy about the UFC warm-up fight, excuse me
*  Connor hasn't won a fight in three years then before that the only fight he's had against Khabib
*  He he has done boxing then fights fucking Khabib hasn't beaten anybody since the Eddie Alvarez fight when you won the title
*  It's crazy. Yeah, it's kind of crazy three
*  fucking half a billion dollars
*  This is where you got it
*  Whatever you want to say about Connor off sees outside doc on antics or it have been crazy
*  But you got to respect the guy who has all that money and goes yeah
*  I'll fight Saroni in January at welterweight that you know number five lightweight in the world
*  He's like y'all fight that guy. Do you think that he can?
*  Reignite the fire that he had like when he KOed Derek Brunson. Nope when he was coming up. No, no that money in the bank
*  I don't think fighting comes from that place
*  But how come some guys when they have hundreds of millions of dollars
*  They still fuck people up like Tyson in his prime Lennox Lewis in his prime
*  Tyson fucked people up until he until he until the bully fought back. Oh, you mean then he got fought
*  No, he's never the same
*  Mmm. I think he's also tired of it too, man
*  I think it was a combination of the he fought a guy who wasn't scared and didn't back down and was like yeah bring it
*  Dude, yeah, and he got fucked. He's lost every fight that the guy was like, I'm not scared
*  He lost those fights, but I'm not saying Tyson wasn't great
*  But when Evander Holyfield's a better boxer man, he's a better fighter, but he don't get the respect
*  Well, there were some guys that weren't scared of him that that's that stood in with him and he beat him by decision
*  You know like didn't he beat Razor Roddick by decision. They had a lot of shit talking. He KOed bonecrusher Smith, right?
*  Yeah, but when we're talking about a tip of the spear like you're holding feeling these in well
*  At that time Evander Holyfield is a real good argument for sure that he's one of the greatest of all time
*  Only guys ever win the title four times easy
*  But I but I but I just think you know with Connor
*  Especially this day and age the UFC is different than boxing where it's such a grind man
*  I'm just gonna guys are so good. Oh my bad. Good. I was I was Evander spent all that money. Oh, yeah
*  I'm like one house
*  Rick Ross the fake Rick Ross owns that house. Oh, yeah, not the real free Ricky the real drug dealer
*  Yeah, was out there doing things in the community
*  Yeah, the rapper the rapper took his name he lost in court
*  Try to get his name back try to get that guy to stop using his name or pay him to use this fucking
*  How about that rapper Rick Ross used to be a cop and now he taught?
*  Yes dope and all the way was a security guard at a prison. Fuck. Yeah
*  So I think something yeah something like that and how about he owns the house, dude
*  So Evander Holyfield made hundreds of millions of dollars five point eight
*  Was not bad because it's outside of Atlanta
*  But it has 37 rooms and like all his family moved in it cost a million dollars just to keep every year
*  I think that was the word there was a million dollars to run for maintenance. Yeah, just everything. Holy fuck, dude
*  He moved into Bellasio
*  Rick Ross made that with another dude's name just talking shit. What a great country
*  You can just talk shit in this country and you can make fucking millions of dollars and and the other thing Rick Ross is
*  He owns like a hundred Buffalo Wild Wings
*  Buffalo stops wing stop wings. Stop. Shout out the wing stop. It's a crispy stops. That's a good move, right?
*  People always want wings wings have been around forever. Do I fucking my mouse?
*  There used to be a place right outside
*  Boston comedy in the village we do sets at Boston Comedy and there was this wing spot and they had
*  They had different levels and one was suicide they had
*  This you would get this suicide sauce on this fucking on these wings. Oh my god
*  Oh, like it was the purpose. I didn't know at the time
*  I didn't understand hot peppers, but it was definitely habanero because it was an orange color
*  Like a real orange color and you would eat those wings and just be like, gee
*  It's like a weird combination of pleasure and pain the same takes your breath away
*  Your lips go white. Ah
*  I fucking love wings. Yeah, I don't want to do that wing show though. It's like not a good way to talk man
*  You know, it's like it'd be interesting. I'm not coming out of your nose. I know crying you do on it though
*  It'd be fun though. Just to see fun to see you on I know but why why you asking people personal questions?
*  Why they're crying what's hot as fuck some guys just?
*  Like some guys just crush it where they don't phase them. Like how does that happen? Oh, there's my friend Tommy Hershko
*  I've talked about him before we used to be a place called chili my soul in
*  Encino and it was this crazy chili place. This guy was into the most
*  Ridiculously hot chili. It was so hot you would have to like sign a waiver if you wanted to buy the stuff that they put
*  in it and
*  They would he was telling me that even with the hottest shit that they had they had like a number system
*  I think I think ten, you know, I think I ate was like the most I could tolerate
*  But they would have these guys from Nepal come and even with the 10 number 10 the hottest shit they had these dudes be putting
*  Some extra hot sauce. Holy fuck. Do you like spicy stuff? I know I don't like it that's why I like I can't handle
*  I see but I like spicy. I like I love
*  Jalapeños with elk it's like my favorite
*  I slice up like four or five jalapenos and I'm in a bunch of slices every time I take a piece of elk
*  I put a piece of jalapeno on that bitch. I know you when you post it. I'm like balls deep in a cheese pizza
*  Dude
*  Stuff keeps you alive gives you fuel you eat that stuff. I know the spice from the pepper and fucking
*  Supernatural muscle of the elk meat. Oh
*  That's the menu man. That was it. So yeah, it was it was a number system
*  Yeah, so ten demon is ten see that ten will fucking end your life ten plus and when oh my god ten plus
*  And when they let you try it they would let you try it in the tiniest cup like a little little
*  Paper cup like that big and they'd give you a little baby spoon like one of them baby spoons you get at the ice cream store
*  I want to try that different flavor set your fucking try that French vanilla and they give you a little something the plastic
*  Yeah, a little something. That's what it's like
*  They would give you that and you would put it in your mouth and I would immediately start hiccuping
*  Your body's like what in the fuck are you doing to me man? There's been a there's been a few people who on that
*  That wing whatever the fuck the hot ones is yeah hot ones
*  That's right
*  The hot ones like Shia LaBeouf took all of them at the end put them all together the guys like I wouldn't do that
*  Dude, and he did it and his he was like about to throw up
*  They like bring a milk or some shit. Well Shia's got other issues
*  For no actor though. Very good. Very good actor. Shut up, you know peanut butter fowl. It's a hard road for all of us
*  Yeah, and he just wanted to get a little further down the road
*  I
*  Spiced is not for me dude, right? I need your boy Logan Paul in Hawaii. Did you really he's wandering around Hawaii?
*  Do you say when were you there talked over Thanksgiving weekend? Nice kid, right? Very nice. Yeah, I've talked to him before I talked to him with you
*  Oh, that's right. We're at the comedy stories there and he had a good fight man. Their fight was good. It was a good fight
*  They they didn't get tired. I mean they fucking went after it for six rounds dude for guys like that to go
*  You know, I've seen guys who have experienced an amateur box and they would gas the fuck out in front of a crowd like that
*  Pretty impressive. It's interesting. You know, here's a guy also doesn't need to do that
*  He makes a lot of money a ton of money makes a ton of money, right?
*  Well, you like it or not. That's the reality of it. Well, someone likes it
*  That's why he's making the money
*  But I mean whether someone listening likes to hear it or not
*  The truth is he makes a ton of my right you can lie all you know, man is broke. They got lost all his money
*  No, it's got all the money and he still decided to fight which is interesting
*  It's like okay, you know if you have that competitive drive in you, you know
*  If you really do have it in you I think I think for him and those youtubers especially at his level is just like
*  What's the next thing that we can compete like getting everyone behind?
*  And it was that they could have done ballet dancing
*  Whatever it is, it would have sold millions and millions of like they could but they chose this which I respect
*  But that KSA guy who I've never seen I'm not familiar with him. I know he's British
*  I like British people so I know he was like they're like a wonder rematch. He's like fuck
*  I'm like in the face again. This was it dude. I'm done. Well, he won for sure
*  So you know for him, that's the best way to end it. Yeah, he was like I'm out and it was real controversial
*  You know what the ref the penalty I'm Logan I thought was ridiculous
*  it was so that's not that ref like and he's respected ref, but it's also like
*  You're in there for this, you know this kind of show like they take it for what it is
*  Never fought for don't take two points from Logan Paul because of that two points. Yeah, I didn't know that a warning
*  That's ridiculous. I didn't agree with that and I think
*  with more fights
*  Logan could learn how to relax. He gets wild and starts swinging for sure. But Logan stop boxing
*  Yeah, you have a jigillion dollars keep doing that dude. Yeah, fuck this exactly exactly
*  But it was interesting watching like this kid can punch athletic man
*  He's very athletic and has a work ethic and in the heat of the battle and he was trained by Shannon
*  Shannon the cannon Briggs. Let's go champ. Let's go. Let's go champ was training them. Yeah, Shannon the cannon knows how to fucking fight
*  Yeah, he'd know he did a real camp and it's just I respect it but it's stuff I go do
*  I mean, maybe we'll know maybe well, yeah, you like you check that box. You're good man, dude
*  What do you think about Adesanya and yo, Romero? Is that real? It's not confirmed yet. Is it?
*  I don't know. I sent you something. I was hoping he sent that to me and I was like, holy shit
*  I cuz I was I fell asleep. I woke up in the morning like here we go
*  But is it not confirmed someone troll me no
*  One of the websites I follow on Instagram it but usually though they leak there and then it gets announced
*  but if he does fight your Romero and when I was talking to
*  Jorge and your meals
*  Manager when I was doing the food truck with Jorge, he was just like oh, or he's getting the fight man
*  I was like no, he's coming off a loss. He was think about his fucking losses. He was he has this
*  Do you think he lost to Paula Costa I was like, mmm
*  I know and got robbed but I can see why they get Paula but you have no you there
*  He was think about before that the Robert Whitaker fight. Yeah fuck with that too
*  He definitely got robbed in the second Whitaker fight. I thought he won that fight
*  Yeah, I've said that many many times too, and I haven't really heard a good argument against it
*  He had him hurt real bad. Yeah at least two rounds. Yeah, I'd have to go back
*  I remember at the time I did score it for Whitaker. Here's my thing. That's fine. Do you think he won?
*  Yeah, all right. I can see that I see both sides
*  But that's an argument for given your Romero the title shot because it's not like you got if you got starts in the game title
*  Shot you like what are you doing? Is it real? This is on your page?
*  Shit
*  But seven here's the problem. Yo, how's it hurt if yo hasn't heard anything, but that's on your else page
*  I know but he goes a lot of people putting saying we fight March
*  How about
*  Should I be ready?
*  Okay, Jesus, how about Andrew Schultz?
*  Andrew Schultz is super close with Izzy and
*  He saw that and he goes dude. Why would Izzy fight this guy doesn't speak very good English. I'm like what I'm like, dude
*  Hold on. What do you say? Yes. Yes, you don't speak English. She needs a guy to speak good English, right?
*  You don't understand your Romero is such a fucking nightmare and for Izzy to go after you
*  Well, it just ups the legend of Izzy. This is what he's doing is perfect. Trust me. It's perfect Andrew stay in your lane
*  If he talked Izzy out of it I'd be so mad at him he would is he's like
*  Of course he wouldn't but imagine if he did what if Andrew had some fucking magic hypnosis power and is he was like
*  Talk to Schultz man, I'm not gonna do it English like what the fuck are we doing? Why'd you do that? Don't forget
*  Don't forget
*  Dude, how about one that fight is confirmed Ferguson Khabib is how the fuck did people not understand? He was saying don't forget
*  You know out of all the times that I've ever not done post fight commentary
*  That was the time I was the most mad would they not let you I wasn't there
*  I wasn't there for that. Oh, so when he was saying it was a fight that I wasn't there but it was if somewhere
*  Where was that? I don't know
*  Don't forget Jesus
*  Look, I know a lot of Cuban people. I know what the fuck he's saying. He's saying don't forget Jesus
*  It's not dope go for gay. Don't forget. Why would he say?
*  It was a fight night that's why you didn't do it there
*  John he's got a Bible quote on his forehead
*  What happened to you USA what happened to you
*  What's going on you forget for the debate on the best of the world?
*  He said don't forget
*  Not forget Jesus God dude, but the thing is he's going what's wrong with you Americans? What's wrong with you Americans?
*  You forget you forget you forget Jesus you gay people. No
*  Pause for a second. I'm gonna be honest
*  I'm gonna be honest. I did a little bit. I was like wait no
*  Because he lights it up with what's wrong with you America. What's wrong with you people? Here's the problem. Here's the problem
*  He said forget pretty clear. That's what fucked you forget you forget right?
*  You believe in gay Jesus, yeah
*  Okay, you forget the USA you forget you forget the best in the world
*  What happened
*  Not for gay Jesus people maybe but maybe not forget Jesus
*  It's like what happened to you not forget Jesus
*  There wasn't like there was some gay thing that was going on that he was commenting on now
*  But he's so bad at English. He's so bad. It easily could be
*  Don't forget Jesus. He said go for Jesus. Don't forget Jesus
*  The only problem is he goes what's wrong with you USA? What's wrong with you? You forget the number one?
*  Jesus what's wrong with you? Go back go back
*  Don't forget. Don't forget. Maybe it's don't forget Jesus, but he says don't forget right one more time because it doesn't make sense
*  Breaking this down
*  First of all pause for a second. You've got to remember. He just got hit in the head a gang of times, right?
*  I mean what fight was this do we remember and look he's got John 3 16 or 3 18
*  On a bandana around his head. He's got a Bible quote on his fucking go for Jesus
*  Not for gay Jesus people go for Jesus not forget Jesus. Yeah, not you forget you forget Jesus
*  It doesn't make sense period for him to say not for gay Jesus that don't make sense
*  No, no, there's no rumors saying don't forget you started a rumor about Jesus being gay
*  Imagine if we were the first ones after all these years
*  Oh, this is what I heard about Jesus and then it becomes like everybody's talking about it like you always tell
*  There was a scroll he really was gay shot broke it down. Shut shop down Jesus was gang. Of course. He loves everybody
*  It's confusing though. I can see how people mix those words
*  We first watch I went always going to harm the pain on the USA and gave but I remember thinking don't hurt it
*  That he was saying don't forget because a lot of Cubans with that accent
*  They might say don't forget. Yeah, don't forget. Don't forget. We go out. Yeah, don't forget it a clock
*  We be here. They have that sort of way of talking. So when I hear don't for gay
*  I'm like always say don't forget Jesus. I'm gonna assume he said don't forget Jesus
*  It doesn't make sense that we'd say now no for gay
*  Doesn't make any problem. He kept saying
*  USA you forget. Yeah, I say you forget and then for gay for gay, but he's barely speaking English
*  Barely that's not there's no way you should hold him accountable to be able to accentuate every word correctly
*  I think I think most people got over it. Yeah, and we just rehashed it
*  We just we have we just like listen man
*  That guy is one of the most scary athletes I've ever seen in the UFC when he knocked out Chris Wyden with that flying knee
*  It just comes out of nowhere. I mean he does shit to people man
*  He throws people he took a fucking straight head kick from Derek Brunson right to the neck
*  Just walked it off like it was nothing pretending like nothing happened doesn't really use his wrestling either
*  Well, he does a little but he doesn't really fuck with it. Yeah, he just wants to knock your head off
*  I think with his mass right the amount of muscle that he has so much muscle and
*  The explosive energy required to try to take somebody down
*  I don't know if he can do that for five minutes for five rounds. No, especially with a guy would take down defense
*  Yeah, no, and then he's a little bit more vulnerable with his striking if he can't explode
*  See, he's not a technical striker in the vein of style bender style bender is a technical striker style bender is setting you up
*  He's giving you looks and traps doing things to you to see how you respond and then he'll fake things and high kick
*  He'll do some shit to you that you don't know is coming. Yo, well is not that yo
*  Well is exploding at a way that you can't handle you can't be on guard all the time
*  You can't be like this because you're gonna burn out. So there's gonna be a moment where you relax
*  There's gonna be a moment where you you can't quite move out of the way quick enough and that's what he's gonna leap on you
*  boom
*  Hits you with that flying knee like you hit why been you like she it's ridiculous
*  I think for style better though and just looking up the matchup and what style been did to Robert Whitaker. Mm-hmm. I
*  Do think is he finishes them? I do
*  It's all about if is he can just keep up from taking him down because if he if they're standing up
*  The thing about yo well is these leaps these power just these giant explosive movements
*  But is he's gonna be aware of that. He's gonna try to see
*  Saw it look at Robert Whitaker never really had opportunity explode like that
*  Is he so good at distance and he's fought big powerful guys before so he's seen that you know
*  The one guy that knocked out is he is starting to fight an MMA again. That's Alex Pereira. Do you know he is?
*  Yep, he's fucking terrifying
*  Yeah, that dude is a ruthless striker house. How's his MMA coming though? I have no idea
*  I know he talks shit dizzy, but it's like that's cuz he KO'd him in a kickboxing fight. Yeah
*  horrific left hook Robert
*  I mean Alex Pereira fucks up everybody more sure MMA is different animal very different different animal very different animal
*  But in kickbox, he has a ways to go. It's too bad. People don't know who that guy is
*  I know, you know because in kickboxing mean you see what he did to Jason wellness. Holy fuck dude
*  Holy fuck
*  Pull up Alex Pereira versus Jason wellness on in glory for the world title, dude, he's a fucking terminator
*  He smashes people. Who's he fighting with? Well, it's all
*  No, man, he's fighting glory. No, I'm saying MMA is I know I have no idea
*  She's just heard that he's about to do it again
*  I don't know if a matchup has even been announced but his fucking striking so dangerous because in a lot of ways
*  He reminds me and not not he's very big not with the fan out
*  Well, this is a kind of knocked out is he not with the finality of like the way Deontay wilder punches
*  But with that kind of he's got that range you like to finish. Yeah. Yeah
*  Deontay something special. He really is. I mean nobody's 216 pounds. Nobody knocks people out with a punch like that
*  God's give a forehead. I mean, I've never seen it
*  He's he's he's like the new next level in terms of striking
*  Ruiz and Joshua's rematch is Saturday. That's right. That's right the seventh
*  so in this fight he sets him up and I think he hits him with a
*  Knee and then a high kick he stops him or a high kick first and then a knee
*  It's coming up here. But Pereira is one of those guys where in it. Okay, it's right there
*  You just missed the knockdown ready. Here it is Pereira is one of those guys that can really do this to anybody
*  It's just a matter of if he hits you so wellness is this top
*  Boom there's the dad damn wellness Jason wellness is as tough as they come. He's been in there with some
*  Fucking killers. In fact, is he lost to Jason wellness by decision?
*  It was a I thought he I thought it was kind of a bad decision. I thought style better. Oh, look at that fly
*  Back that up again. I was talking. Let's see that again. Watch this. This is how good Alex fucking Pereira is son. Watch this
*  Boom just look one more time. Look how good that knee is watch that left knee. Yeah, I mean that shit's perfect
*  Perfect. Look at that again. Watch this
*  Yeah, boom. Oh, that is that is a perfect flying knee and that's just how tough Jason wellness where was his MMA fight?
*  Jamie do you know?
*  So he's got me trouble for sure for everybody if he can stop it
*  Remember Rico van hoeven came over straight. Yeah, he's trained at a K
*  And have we heard from did he just got that rematch with Badr Hari in kickbox?
*  Yeah, that's coming up real soon
*  But I thought he was gonna keep doing MMA and eventually come on over to the dark side
*  I think he wants to do that after Badr Hari, but the Badr Hari fight is the biggest fight in all of kickboxing
*  Okay, so he's had two fights that he won and one fight that he lost
*  So he lost his you his MMA debut by submission reenacted choke
*  But then he won two fights by KL and TKO the fun three years
*  Yeah, that's he's fighting in jungle fights, which is kind of like the LFM. Yeah. Yeah, but that was then
*  I mean who knows who he's fighting now, but see if you could pull up Alex Pereira fight soon
*  So how old is he?
*  I'll say it's like 30. How old is he?
*  Third to
*  In find two years. Yeah, we talked to what's all about whether or not he's got a ground game
*  I don't know anything about his ground game. Yeah, all I know about is his striking is fun. I'm ferocious, dude
*  He's so scary and he could do that to anybody if you could do that style bender
*  You could fucking do that to anybody for sure
*  And if you see the style bender fight, he catches him a clean left hook and just shuts his lights out
*  But shows you how good style benders do. Yep. Boom. Look how good this guy is. Jesus Christ, bro
*  But how about style bender has the skill set to fight a guy like that? That wasn't style better right there
*  That was a different fight. Was that different?
*  Champ champ it said of glory. Yes, he won two division champ. Yeah, he's fighting 205 and 85
*  Right. Is that the two differences in the weight classes? I think so either way murderer just a murderer scary guy
*  there's a but
*  There's
*  This everybody and then there's Wilder. There's everybody everybody with power you've ever seen and then there's Wilder Wilder's powers
*  Like what is happening? Like he's got superpower
*  Yeah, like his techniques not phenomenal. It's just not you sometimes he throws from the hip
*  It's just like when you touch you it's over. And here's the thing
*  He's not like a George Foreman or like these bigger dudes. He's he's little floats around 213 to 219
*  Yeah, like he's not a big dude. Not even not even remotely big. It's insane
*  It's insane when he hit Ortiz on the forehead and just draw and that's not an easy fight. No
*  Monster no and it showed number Ortiz was winning in my book. He was winning
*  And now you got fury Wilder in February
*  What do you think about Saturday night what I mean Oh with
*  Joshua pieces them up. Do you do I do really I hate when people say, you know, oh, it's like a Buster Douglas situation
*  It's not cuz someone doesn't like Mexicans
*  So, yeah, we're kidding folks, yeah my girls makes him my kids
*  Yeah kids are Mexican for God's sake dude Andy Ruiz has got a shot
*  he has a shot but because he was also be it's not a fluke like Buster Douglas Mike Tyson because
*  Andrew Ruiz is winning most the fight before he even knocked him out
*  Yeah, not got knocked down third, but he was winning. He had more rounds in the bank
*  Well, he got knocked down, but then he got back up and knocked Joshua down, correct
*  But so he was ahead on the scorecards too
*  So and then he just stopped them right but I think it was the perfect storm for Anthony Joshua to lose the fight
*  I think Joshua knows what he's dealing with remember that was a late replacement
*  He's supposed to fight big baby Miller and also going in that camp. He was dealing with some personal issues, which
*  Everybody does but the other thing is he gotten the rumor is his comers that he got knocked out in camp by a Philadelphia
*  Heavyweight who's the guy do you know? I forget that he's a stud
*  I definitely heard the rumor from multiple different sources that he got knocked out legit source
*  I heard like guys who would know it seemed like it there was another rumor that he had a nervous breakdown in the locker room
*  That he knew he shouldn't have been fine and his dad was like no, let's not go out there
*  So that's why he sees dad arguing with Eddie Hearn. Yeah, and here's what else is interesting too
*  Is now they're doing the rematch. It's in Saudi Arabia. They they didn't have arena there
*  They built it for this seats 15,000 people put so crazy. He's making 75 million dollars some shit like
*  yeah for this fight and
*  It's I think it there they know what's going on
*  There's something going on because it's away from everything like media is not gonna be the Saudi Arabia
*  So there's like the pressure of the English crowds not there
*  So I they're trying to protect the golden goose here in Saudi Arabia. Would you think he's the golden goose?
*  Here's what I think I think if Andy Ruiz knocks him out again
*  He's as big a golden goose as there is in the world. You know, how many fucking Mexicans are I bro?
*  I don't have to tell you you made to yourself
*  There's a lot of Mexicans man and the guy's soft-spoken. He's a sweetheart. He's got fantastic hands
*  I mean, he's got a fluidity to him that you rarely see in the heavyweight division
*  Where's a lot of heavyweights they're like big one punch guys
*  No, he's a combo is this like Bob and we even and throwing combinations
*  But people are confused because if you've just discovered Andy Ruiz in that Anthony Joshua fight, he's not a finisher
*  He's not a knockout artist. That was just that fight. It was balls to the wall. He just had nothing to lose
*  He was like playing with house money
*  But now he's a better pure boxer than Joshua, but Joshua I bet you finishes him under 10
*  Interesting yeah
*  Well, he definitely heard him in the first fight
*  He heard him first and then threw caution to the wind and got cracked
*  Yep, because he underestimated Andy's resolve and his ability to recover
*  He didn't realize how good Andy is inside that, you know in close quarters
*  No imagine what would happen if instead of going crazy and trying to stop him
*  What if he just boxes on the outside and keeps trying to last shot? Yes
*  Yeah, that's what he's gonna do. Yeah instead of going in like he did in the first fight, correct
*  Ruiz I think is gonna he's gonna stand outside use a jab set him up
*  he's gonna win rounds with footwork in boxing and then event in the jab and then eventually
*  Six seven eight Ruiz can be way down on the cards and like right fuck go for broke. I think it's caught coming in
*  Interesting prediction who knows who knows for sure I feel like Ruiz is gonna have incredible confidence
*  Because he's going into this fight knowing that he's able to beat the heavyweight champ of the world win the title and he's got fucking
*  Rolls-royce now, okay, he's going in there with champ attitude you think yes, or is he going there down himself?
*  I don't think so two things. I don't think so. I think you realize he can hang with the chance
*  He knocked him out. He won the title
*  I think he's the fucking champ and I think he's got more love and more respect than he's ever had in his life
*  I think he likes it seems like he's having a good time. I think we see an even better Andy Ruiz
*  I think we see you beat them. Yep. I don't know. I don't know if he beats him
*  But I think he's gonna be better. I think I think Josh was gonna be better, too
*  I think both guys realized this better Joshua, but also Joshua loses his fight. It's like where does he go from here?
*  I don't know man. I don't know. I mean look you tell me you wouldn't want to see Joshua Wilder
*  I'll watch Joshua fury all goddamn day. I'll watch Wilder knocks Joshua Cole. I want to see everything me too
*  I want to see it all I want to see everything. I want to see all of it. I think
*  Andy lost weight was Andy way now. I
*  Think he's down his speeds trouble, man, dude his combinations. He's so fluid so
*  Forget about Joshua though man. You remember can't forget who was a gold and he got dropped by Vladimir Klitschko
*  Remember that came back and fuck lined him. Yes, we do in white like his resumes insane. Oh, yeah
*  I mean Olympic gold medalist, you know and probably the best body in the history of the division
*  Boys bodied up seriously. Yeah, like especially when he fought when he fought Ruiz. He was a little thick
*  I think he's lost a little weight himself
*  I think one of the things he's done is he's gone less strength and conditioning and more pure box
*  He was so big he was talking about that
*  He said essentially his word the way described it is I was listening to this interview with him some English gentleman
*  And he was saying that you think about it. You have a hundred percent of your energy
*  If you put fifty percent of it to strength conditioning and fifty percent of it to boxing
*  You're not gonna achieve the same amount as if you put a hundred percent to boxing something to that fact
*  Yeah, so the idea is he's doing less road work
*  He's doing more conditioning in the gym and he's doing like heavy bags mitts smart
*  Yeah, it's because if you look at you know, any Ruiz kind of advantage is over and be speed combinations
*  So you don't want just be this big heavy bulk or also if you're looking at future matchups fury and Wilder
*  They're all lighter on the feet. Yeah, you know move better better cardio. So how much weight is he lost?
*  He said he's taken on a prison workout mindset for this fight well his career is on the line I think
*  Here's a thing too then it's same with the Conor McGregor Conor's careers on the line as well against cowboy
*  Oh for sure. So so when you put these guys
*  And your weas as tricked fans into thinking he's lost weight did that burke-chrysher trick for this picture
*  He said where he lifted his arms up near his arms up for her Christ your trick. First of all, how dare you?
*  Burk Chrysher though. No, no
*  Exactly the same is exactly the same more recent training video
*  Let me see
*  There's a video of him hitting the the shield and
*  He misses and catches his trainer on the chin get a little wild fuck. Yeah, he drops his trainer
*  I would be worried about any reason, you know
*  He's haven't seen the spotlight in that money and there's the Rolls-Royce and he might have been partying San Diego
*  I'd be worried about him. I'd be worried about him, you know being like, oh, this is the life. Yeah, that's possible. Yep, but
*  I don't think so. I think I think he's a disciplined guy
*  I think he just is wild and I mean and just like soon off can't be that discipline with that body
*  No, no, no, he looks a certain way that you're not gonna get away with
*  Discipline doesn't come to the because of food. Well, it's not gonna win any best body contest
*  But he fucks a lot of people up fucks a lot of people up
*  I don't think he's gonna have a trick Joshua this time though
*  The first time he tricked him Joshua's probably looking at him like I'm gonna fuck this boy. I was like, oh, oh, that's what you do
*  I've seen this in the millions of fights. I've had in the Olympics. Yeah, watch this. That's what I think's gonna happen now for reasons wins
*  All right, but you know, I just I just I don't see it man
*  It's it's so interesting because it becomes as big a fight as Wilder Fury 2
*  It becomes a giant fight Wilder Fury 2 to me is the heavyweight fight. That's the heavyweight fight
*  Really interested in this fight Joshua third
*  I think Joshua Joshua is like it used to be Joshua number one the golden child and he you know
*  Obviously lost so he fell off but Wild and Fury have just been doing their thing
*  Well, this is the fight that I want to see more than anything is Wilder Fury 2
*  That's the number one just because the first one was so controversial and fantastic so good and you know
*  I rewatched it yesterday. In fact, you can make a real real solid argument that Tyson Fury got robbed
*  Oh hundred percent the only
*  Argument for Deontay Wilder is you know, he did knock him down
*  Oh dad if the fight was a fight if it's a fight fight
*  you know like in the streets and
*  Two guys were going at it like that and one guy dropped the guy and blasted him and then dropped him in the end
*  And he was laying on his back and he got up and you know at the end of the round
*  They decided it was the end of the fight. You would say man. I think he won
*  He fucked that dude up
*  But as far as boxing rules go in contest fury won that fight fury won the box here on first
*  But Deontay Wilder man, I like the draw though because Deontay Wilder had did the most damage in the fight
*  So I was like, alright when it was a draw, I'm like, oh I dig that
*  Here's the argument against the draw though. He gets dropped Tyson Fury gets dropped in the the final round, right?
*  Loses one point for sure, right?
*  It's definitely now a 10-8 round for Tyson for Deontay Wilder after that knockdown was a bad knockdown
*  But then he gets up and wins the rest of the round. So what do you say there?
*  Point for that so you know if you're one the fight, so what is it nine eight?
*  What is that then?
*  If it's a ten point must system, how does that work? Does that mean then would it go back to even?
*  Can you have a seven seven round if you both drop each other twice? I don't think so. I don't think so
*  No, right. What happens there? Do you ever imagine if guys just that wouldn't just go back that you want to score that round?
*  Ten eight you do it ten nine. Shouldn't we know this it just be a ten nine
*  I should definitely know this but even we use the same scores in the UFC don't think dude here
*  This is not where you at all. So could be Tony. I'm like fuck
*  Yeah, finally best fight skill wise all-time lightweight division one of the best fights the US could ever make but same place Brooklyn
*  Brooklyn might have voodoo. Why are we doing it there, dude?
*  You got and guess who's the doctor probably homeboy freaked out when he saw blood on Nate Diaz. That's right
*  So he's a doctor you don't think Tony Ferg's and be using those elbows. Oh my god, that's so true doc. Take a fucking high
*  That's so true. He's gonna use those elbows from the bottom to Sun. He's not scared of getting taken down
*  Not at all. Not at all enjoys it. You're fighting off his back. He loves it
*  You're gonna get that I think you're gonna get one of the greatest trilogies of mixed martial arts history with those three
*  He can scramble in a way that other guys can't it's dangerous other places could be
*  When you look at the matchups you're just like holy shit Tony is a perfect kind of foe for a cabib
*  Well, particularly because he's so good at submitting people from his back when with everything with arms and with legs
*  I mean he beat Kevin Lee with a triangle think about how many people he darsed
*  How about that Barbosa fight?
*  Dars to guy that's completely covered in blood which is so hard to do. Here's the other thing you got to remember
*  Tony doesn't get tired doesn't get tired. It's a wave. It's a slow wave. So in the fifth
*  He's actually better than he was in the first. How is that possible? What the fuck is he doing?
*  Strength and conditioning wise that other people are not just always been that way. I think it's a genetic thing
*  I think you know, I used to train with Tony at rain
*  He would he would spar with everybody else keep going to guys like I'm good then go to the bag or run sprints
*  He's just it's just in his DNA to keep going you talked Eddie about it like dude
*  He's doing six hour long practices
*  Yeah
*  They said there's no one like him and they said that everybody else gets exhausted all the people that train with him
*  They're all getting exhausted and he's lapping them running hills. Does his hill sprints lapse everybody?
*  I mean just a freak like the King of Alaska's thing. We're like, what the fuck's going on?
*  Right what is happening there? But you know, it is both Mexican too. There's something about that
*  Something Gilbert Melendez to back in his prime known for having cardio. Actually, he said it
*  I think a lot of his just like powerful Mexican genetics Mexican DNA
*  Listen man, you know any endurance and your he says hold my hand sandwich
*  Maybe some quesadillas
*  Hold my fucking tamale real quick if he wins, dude, come on man, you know what kind of celebration?
*  We're gonna have an LA if he beats Ruiz you say he beats Joshua rather. Yeah, maybe I mean can else the fucking
*  He's the fucking man too. Here's the really crazy thing ready for this
*  If Andy Ruiz lost all the fat on his body how much you think you weigh
*  He's probably 250 right 250 to 60 not tall either he's maybe six one six two
*  Okay, and that's on there so it's really five eleven then what's his weight?
*  boys
*  250 you see 250 stick like a bowl of guacamole. Yeah
*  Drink yogurt you can't drink guacamole
*  They make yoga drinks. They don't make guacamole drinks. It's so great out of here. What do we got? I'm a fan of him
*  I just think
*  Did he really wait
*  Was he against
*  Anthony Anthony Joshua in the first fight dude 511 to 62 that boys
*  You can lose a little
*  No, you know that or not or he's just like what why dude? I'm fucking do I'm the heavyweight champion in the world
*  He has three belts. He has more belts than Wilder more belts than anybody
*  Here's an argument that I always used to make about Roy Nelson is that he could take body shots better because it's like he's wearing
*  eight sweaters
*  Yeah
*  They hit like a Mack truck
*  Roy take a shot to the belly like it was not do people would kick him remember like Frank was kicking
*  Everybody's kicked with croak up rocked him in the stomach. Yeah
*  Listed I couldn't find it in pounds. It was listed as 19 stones and two pounds
*  268 you 270 bro 511 270
*  He trains hard he trains hard, but he must again shit out some Mexican food Mexican genetics
*  Dude Mexican food to will pack on the pounds if you look into some calorie dense food, bro
*  There's a place up here. What is that place on Canoga? Where is that place that Mexican joint that we go to my soul?
*  No, no, no, no, no, it's one of the best places
*  This is one little joint you want to say the name cuz I don't want them to get flooded
*  Oh don't because I need a spot around dude. It's so good. It's so authentic
*  The Mexican soap operas are playing
*  Pickled jalapenos
*  They got language ideas my baby six days old
*  If I had one food forever it might be Mexican Mexican or Italian
*  Yeah, one of those two if I could only have one thing forever like a specific ethnic food Mexican so good
*  Yeah, although it's kind of no one I might say Brazilian
*  Really? I may say chu has Korea if I had one me sure. Yeah, I wouldn't miss the meat
*  Yeah, dude all the yet carne asada with Mexican. Oh, that's true
*  that's true
*  Sada yeah, but
*  Like if I'm if there's a Mexican joint next to a photo to child
*  You know what I'm not big fucker to chow guys stresses me out. I gotta flip the green. They just keep coming
*  I'm sweating and I don't and I don't eat the salad bar. I'm like, you ain't funny dick me on that, dude
*  That's how you keep your own digestive tract clean. No, it's a fiber. I only eat the fillet the real expensive one
*  I'm like, you know what I'm looking for. You like my fillet. Oh, dude. I forget. What is the way to go?
*  I think that's it roast. Yeah. Yeah, it's real pink. Yeah
*  They bring the chicken or the sausage I'm like bitch I didn't come here for sausage
*  Go get the fucking red meat bro. What's with the dried tomatoes? Oh
*  I know you're you could put away some food. I guarantee you Ari Shafir will eat you under the table in that place
*  I agree. I don't eat that much food this but you can if you want I could you could you got a lot of room
*  Yeah, you're a big fella bigger than Ari Shafir
*  I'm telling you I never seen nothing like it. He can he just goes for plates and plates all of us including Diaz
*  It's always the skinny guy sitting back sitting back on what the fuck is going. It's like it's free
*  What you want? I'm gonna keep eating. So I think Ari when he knows he's gonna go to FOGO to child
*  He like won't eat for like a day. I think the Jew in a man. He just he just gangster about it
*  It's I think it's competitive as well
*  It's like kind of as fun you think you think you're gonna make me pay this much and I'm not gonna eat more than that's worth
*  did we
*  We had Dan Soder on you the comic comic he's funny guy man. The best he's from a new HBO special, right? Yeah, damn
*  Yeah, he's from
*  Aurora we played against each other in high school. Oh shit. What did he play? He played a linebacker at Smokey Hill
*  I played at Overland so we know each other. That's hilarious. Yeah, so we had him on the show day
*  But he was talking about we're talking he was talking about how the culture in LA the comics how they like help each other out
*  I was like well
*  That's because Joe Rogan is the guy that cultivated that kind of atmosphere where you know
*  We help each other out in the podcast game and the comics like Joe's the one who started that and he goes
*  You know who started in New York and I'm like, I don't see it in New York
*  I know you guys and Andrew Schultz kind of part of the squad over here now
*  But and he goes when Ari moved from LA because of Joe when I moved from LA came to New York
*  He came in there was like fuck's wrong with you guys. What's wrong with you guys and just kind of like took over
*  I was like no, no, we're gonna help each other out man
*  And he's like that and he learned that obviously you and Ari are close
*  But he took that same attitude brought to New York, that's interesting my take on it was always you should treat it like martial arts
*  Like we're in there doing battle. It's not us versus us and if you're better I get better
*  Yep, it's was better for everybody and we got into this because we're fans of comedy
*  Yeah, I got into comedy because I loved watching it. I want to watch it
*  I want to watch Diaz like I want to watch Theo. I want to watch count. I want to watch you
*  I want to watch every I want to watch people kill. I want to watch I want to watch McCoskey
*  It's also your friends like I don't see that anybody's bomb. I know we laugh when someone bombs
*  But do we know so many good comics bill burr? I mean cut the fucking shit. There's so many of them now delia
*  There's so many murder Whitney. There's a bunch of murders Bert Schultz. Dude. There's so many
*  Shultz is murdered mark Norman's hilarious. There's so many good comics now, and if you really love comedy
*  We're supposed to do that for each other
*  There's not many of us man the idea that like your success somehow or another is bad for me, that's crazy
*  What am I gonna be in Tennessee when you're in Tennessee? You know you're gonna come follow me around
*  We're gonna battle for the same customers. There's fucking people everywhere. There's 300 million people
*  We've also done shows in the same town and you're doing these giant arenas
*  Yeah, we just and I'm doing the improv and they all sell out
*  Yeah, dude, we we have a unique thing and this unique thing is really
*  only appreciated
*  By the people that are doing it like everybody that's doing it
*  Like realizes like this is unusual
*  We haven't had this before but but I think it comes from you need someone in your position to do that people go
*  Oh, that's he's killing and he's nice like that. Oh that makes sense. You know well. I think that's where it comes from very happy
*  Yeah, I'm very happy because it's a it's a it's a different time. It's a different feel
*  It's a different time
*  You know like when I was coming up when I was my early days the Comedy Store was like very
*  Backstabby and very like people didn't they didn't help anybody and they weren't happy when you got good things
*  And you know this just wasn't a lot of camaraderie
*  You know like me and Diaz that was like my first real comrade at the store
*  You know when I became like really good friends with Joey because I realized like Joey's like a real guy
*  You know what I mean? He's the best guy. He's an animal like he grew up
*  I mean he when I met him was only a few years after he got released for armed kidnapping
*  But I knew who he was like I got it. I go like this is a man like like I'm his friend
*  We're friends. I'm that guy's friends to the death
*  Yeah, I'm his friend to the death and I know that about him with me 100%
*  We became friends like real early on in our life and you guys would go on the road together
*  Oh, yeah, man, I would eat it man. I ate it going on after him wants Jersey
*  Dude, I wasn't ready. I had only been doing comedy got to realize when I came out to LA
*  I'd only been doing comedy six years two four six eighty four ninety four. Yes. Were you headlining in six years?
*  Yes, yes. Yes, and I shouldn't have been you know, and I ate it a few times
*  I ate it once I was headlining four years in and Jim Brewer made me fucking go down in flames
*  Who's one of the most horrific bombings of my career?
*  But I learned something out of it one I learned by watching Jim Jim was
*  Murdering just destroying and to I learned that I was nervous. I was real nervous before I went on
*  I wasn't enjoying him. I wasn't laughing at him instead. I was scared
*  I was like sitting back there scared that I had to go next
*  How am I gonna follow this instead of laughing and enjoying it and going up there as a guy?
*  Who's having a good time and wants everybody to have a good time?
*  I was going up there selfish and they can smell that
*  Like oh this guy's
*  I wasn't thinking about having a good time
*  I wasn't thinking about being the director of having a good time. So I had to learn that with Diaz
*  I learned that with with with Brewer for sure
*  but I never had a foul Brewer again after that other than maybe like a small spot at the the
*  Like Boston comedy or Carolines or something like that, but not when he was doing like a half an hour
*  He was the middle and I was a headliner and I wasn't supposed to be a fucking headline
*  You know Brewer's doing like he's open up for a while Metallica. Yeah, but Metallica didn't they I think Hatfield just checked into rehab
*  Yeah, I know so yeah, so they had to stop doing it Brewer's a monster
*  But but so but me taking Diaz on the road with me first of all like I
*  Knew like I want to take guys on the road with me that can hang that we're fun. We could talk shit
*  We can have fun. We can go to dinner and laugh. Yes
*  You go to dinner with Joey Diaz you've been dinner with us it's the god damn Joey Diaz show the best
*  We're just crying and he knows that we love him and he knows we're giant fans
*  He turns it on so he turns it on. Yeah, I gotta tell everybody
*  That's the funniest person that's ever walked the face of the earth
*  He said things that I couldn't believe he fucking said in restaurants
*  We're falling on the ground pounding the carpet under the table can't breathe can't breathe and he's a
*  Fucking animal but like to have a guy like that and to go on a road with a guy like that
*  You also have to be sharp like you have to you have to pick your game up
*  You should I mean it's basically you're sparring with the best of the best you can't slack off
*  No, you just can't there's none of that you can't do that you have to be ready and you have to enjoy it
*  So what I learned to do instead of being scared to go on after him, which I what definitely was a couple of times
*  We're taking that one time in Jersey. I remember I did okay
*  We're taking that one time in Jersey, I remember I did okay, I did good like I didn't bomb but there was moments
*  Where was rough it was today? I'd want to kill myself, but
*  Wasn't that good anyway, you know, I mean I could barely get through it anyway, but I remember
*  Just it was like whoa like there was like ten whole minutes where I was struggling before I picked it up
*  It was bombing. It's bad day. It wasn't the worst kind of bombing where they don't clap when you leave
*  Yeah, but
*  I've had that man. That's rough. Thank you. Good night. There's nothing like fuck you. We look whoa, sorry
*  Sorry to mean the bomb like that, but but I definitely wasn't as funny as him
*  I was expected to do this fellas. I put
*  But then so then we all started hanging out together, right?
*  And then it was like Ari and red band and Duncan and we all support each other and we all
*  Started just spreading this idea like what we're all friends
*  Okay, like just because we're all doing the same job we're not in competition with each other
*  We're supposed to be the opposite. Yeah, we're supposed to be in support of each other
*  and then if you do that then we can bring other people along too and
*  Instead of it being a network like NBC or ABC or CBS or whatever these people you don't know and their job is just to
*  Find people that they can sell on television. They're trying to find to bring
*  Trying to find a product whether it's the Tonight Show or it's friends or whatever the show is
*  They're trying to figure out how something could go in there and everybody feels like they're competing for that
*  Well, I'm like, well, that's we're in the opposite situation now now the more people the better
*  So it's not like you and I are both competing for some fucking roll on Cheers. It's not what it is now
*  It's the more the better. Yeah, like the more if you know funny people and then they go
*  Oh Brendan says that guy's funny. He must be funny
*  He knows funny and then they watch that guy and that and you can and then it's a real network
*  So then it's a network of friends. So it's a different kind of network. There's no contracts
*  No, but everybody knows if Theo Vaughn tells you somebody's funny that guy's got to be funny because Theo Vaughn is funny as fuck
*  Yeah, so it's just like nice little thing where everybody's kind of helping everybody and then when you go there
*  Now it's like a feeling of family like every time we go to the store. It's all hugs. Everybody's hugging, you know
*  It's all what's up. It's all friendly
*  It's not known all the weirdness man and it helps people it helps people get over the hump because sometimes
*  One would keep someone from becoming a professional is like, you know
*  You know
*  you don't have supportive friends and you don't put the extra effort into it because it doesn't feel good to be there because you're
*  Not doing well because you bomb too often. That's a big one
*  You need someone to like pull you aside when you're bombing and go hey man
*  You gotta stop opening with that bit you make people uncomfortable, but also go I've been there too. Yes
*  We've all been there dude. Anybody tells you they have a bomb is either a thief either
*  Stealing all their jokes or they're just not telling the truth and I real comic you know, it's hard
*  It's fucking hard this and you you get humbled every time you come up with something new and every time you have to do a new
*  Special and every time you have to put away the old jokes or write new ones. You're humbled
*  You're eating shit all the time. There's no way you're not going to if you're coming up with a new bit
*  There's gonna be a time where you're gonna say it where you've never said it before
*  That's just that's as a fact and it's never gonna be that good when you're in that state
*  Yeah
*  Bambi on ice it's so embarrassed trying to fucking it's so embarrassed and you're forcing it. It's clunky
*  That's the game though. Yeah, that's what we do and the more we do it together
*  The more we help each other the more makes people want to come see it too
*  So it's like the stores never been more packed. Never never been more packed. It's sold out every night every night
*  It's and it's everybody's got a good vibe. It's nice
*  There's no darkness everybody's happy it's nice people
*  I'm happy to help I'm happy to help but I'm just trying to promote the thing that we all want
*  We all want it, you know, it's not like trying to show people something. They don't want
*  Everybody wants family everyone who wants brotherhood and sisterhood everybody wants like a nice community
*  Everybody wants to feel good. But like some people think
*  Everybody has imposter syndrome too, man
*  When you when you meet famous people like I was had a phone call the other day with Johnny Depp
*  You did me and Johnny Depp are talking on the phone and I'm like what is going on in my fucking life?
*  I'm here having a phone call with Johnny Depp. Do you want to come on the podcast? Oh, I don't know
*  It's just I just wanted to talk to him. It was just a cool conversation. Really? Yeah. Yeah good guy
*  Oh, he's very nice guy. I'm a big fan. He's a sweetheart of a guy phenomenal
*  But it's like talking to him on the phone like what is this life?
*  You know and people every even I bet even Johnny Depp feels like he's full shit
*  Everybody feels well shit like a fraud. That's gonna pull the curtain up. Yeah
*  Ah fuck and when everybody said like you suck you're a fraud like yeah, you're right. Everyone's a fuck cool, man
*  Everyone I guarantee you Daniel Day-Lewis probably feels like a fraud sometimes. It's imposter syndrome. Everyone gets it. But so
*  Talking to Johnny Depp you're like what the fuck is happening?
*  Before that was Kanye West. Yeah, that was weird too to you. That was an insane too. That was weird, too
*  It was real weird. It's weird. I met Paul McCartney once the improv. I was like hello
*  What and the fuck am I doing staring at you?
*  How are you a real thing? How are you really Paul McCartney crazy? I didn't even stick around to talk to him
*  Just said hi kept moving
*  Hi
*  Somebody just stand up to how he thinking about it while I was like a friend. Oh, we can handle it
*  McCartney gets really bummed out. What if I did like the Caitlyn Jenner thing and have you out of me?
*  You know, have you ever talked to those guys that's come on the podcast and anyone said no or you don't even push it
*  Chappelle is an interesting one cuz Dave I've talked about it. Yeah. No Mike
*  Rick Chappelle motherfucker
*  his
*  cousin
*  Dave is a you know, Dave said it was like he's like I'll do it sometimes
*  You go, but I don't know, you know, and I was like dude, I hear you. I don't do anybody else's
*  I mean, I don't have any time. Why would you yeah, I'm any time and second of all I get it man
*  You say enough with your comedy and it's like Dave is a smart guy, man. He figured it out
*  He figured out where was slipping away when they were fucking with him when he was doing the Chappelle show and he was like
*  You know what? Just sit back for a bit dip to sit back for a bit and he started dude. Do you know what he did?
*  Yes here when an artist Dave Chappelle's
*  He wasn't scheduling shows instead he would bring a speaker to the park. I know in Seattle
*  he'd set up a fucking speaker and do an impromptu stand-up show and
*  Everybody was like what is going on? And at the time he could have filled up arenas man crazy
*  I mean still can for sure, you know still can still does the ones I did with him were phenomenal
*  We had so much fun, but he decided to take time off
*  He decided that like let me just sit back and you know this especially at the level you're at this step away is
*  Probably the hardest to say no is probably the hardest thing. He's our biggest genius
*  He's our biggest comedy genius and he might he might be one of the biggest comedy geniuses ever
*  Oh, yeah, but he's certainly our biggest comedy genius of today. He understands comedy like nobody else
*  did you hear what he said to Trevor Noah was on a show and they asked him about opening for Dave Chappelle because Chappelle brought
*  him on a bunch of dates and
*  Trevor Noah was like he was saying he goes I mean I'm fairly good at stand-up
*  I'm not the best but you know, I've been to step a while now and he goes I'm in the greener with Dave Chappelle
*  He goes and I'm thinking why the fuck would he have me open for like he has all these guys like great comics
*  What do you have me? So he said that to him? He goes hey Dave. I don't know man
*  Why the fuck do you have me?
*  At your shows way on me open for you
*  He was you know a million better comics and he goes I can find any funny. There's a ton of funny people
*  There's a ton of funny comics use but you're funny and interesting
*  So to your point, he's like we can go to dinner like you're an interesting person and people care about interesting people
*  So there's guys I can bring out who are gonna murder but they're not interesting people don't care you're you can murder and you're interesting
*  That's why you're here. I like to talk to Dave see if that was an accurate quote. Yeah, I do it like what?
*  I told me he's cool, man
*  And he's just Trevor Noah just kidding he said I'm here because I'm really smart
*  He
*  Started his podcast right?
*  I tried to talk him into it for literally a year really
*  I think I started talking to about it last February or something like that February or March was when did he do the podcast?
*  The first time you told me to do a podcast from then on I'm like, what are you doing? Man? You were born so funny
*  He's in shram about anything. He could ramble
*  Okay, so almost you know, like whatever that is ten months
*  So ten eleven months ago, you got it going and finally got it going so funny
*  That's it and he's doing it with Kate Quigley, which is perfect. Oh nice. Yeah dynamic
*  Yeah, it's perfect and have someone to bounce off shit, you know
*  We can bill bird or Chris or delia and just speak into the mic. That's a special
*  Yes, he could do that and he has done that but it's better to have Kate Quigley there bounce ideas
*  Yeah, first of all Kate understands like comedy. She knows what he's doing
*  Way if he goes on a rant, yeah, you know, it's perfect, you know, she'll bring people there herself
*  So she'll bring people to the podcast as well. It'll help
*  You know who else started podcast and finally is Whitney Cummings. I know killing it to of course killing it
*  She should have been doing a long time ago. Okay, she's another one. She would do other people's podcast. I know she like prepare
*  She's like one of the rare people would prepare for podcast. No, come in with notes
*  I know she had to talk about she's so smart
*  She's most ambitious people I've ever met in an interesting way not ambitious like wants to be famous
*  No, but wants to complete projects. She's always like well in the middle of directing this
*  Documentary on violence so much going on. What are you talking about? Why are you directing you directing documentaries?
*  Dude our neighborhood is Whitney Tom Segura. Like it's all of us right there, man
*  It's a vortex bro, it's a vortex. You see Tom's girls dance video. Yes, it's fantastic, bro
*  Bert holy shit, and I he said the director ever want him to stow him take a gun and keep shooting them
*  Oh my god, and Tom was like, alright, I'm down but I guess that it was too long
*  So he's like we cut that out just me stabbing you. Yeah, the stabbing thing is the way to go
*  Yeah, but it's dancing. I mean Duke and dance he can dance, you know, he's starting to do comedy shows in Spanish
*  Oh my god, how crazy is that?
*  In Spanish, yeah
*  He just did a special in Austin
*  Just he just felt like he just filmed it but that was not in Spanish. No, no, that's regular but he's
*  Yeah, I was thinking about this cowboy versus Connor fight that's the most Irish guy versus the most American guy
*  It's Bud Light verse proper with actual bud not bud. Light. Oh, is it Bud Weiser? He's not trash
*  Bud light I thought but light with this is it Bud Weiser?
*  He's a bear bro real shit the real shit fuck you're like Bud Light if you're like eating clams or something you want something cold
*  Dude, it's Bud Weiser verse proper whiskey. That's what I'm saying. And I like my Bud Weiser in a can
*  I like to know I'm a piece of shit me too
*  Fancy class
*  Is Connor reaching for his whiskey well Cowboys reaching for his Bud Weiser
*  I mean, I guess I wish they would have done it in like Dublin or something like a giant stadium in Dublin
*  Where are they doing it Vegas Vegas? Well, they probably had an agreement with Vegas anyway
*  See, I think the thing about Vegas is like there's the most people that can come it's easy to get to there's the most amount of
*  Hotels you make the most money. You make the most money and make the most yeah, it's it's
*  Look, it's gonna be fucking great. I know I just on TV or watch it live. It's gonna be fucking great
*  I can't wait and if Connor can you know can catch him early?
*  It could be very interesting. It's literally a you know a sprint verse a marathon
*  Because cowboy is stick around and yeah, you know five rounds for Connor at welterweight
*  It scares me man
*  If cowboy can use his distance and he's very good at doing it, you know, and he can avoid that straight left, you know
*  Cuz Connor's got a piston of a left hand man
*  I think Connor's better with his hands, but Cowboys better with his feet and also the one thing everyone's forgetting is
*  Cowboy can fucking wrestle man. Any a phenomenal submission
*  So yeah, if he wants to pull that out at some point of the fight, he can definitely do it
*  I don't think he's going to I don't think he's going to eyes the Mike Perry fight opened a lot of eyes Mike Perry's a
*  Gorilla gorilla that guy is fucking strong as shit. And when when cowboy arm barred him, you know
*  Mike Perry sent him a picture of x-rays of a broken arm. That wasn't really his arm
*  Oh really this we did to my arm. So it's like oh hell no and cowboys like what?
*  Really? Well, he didn't really break his arm
*  And I said what's that about? He was a strange guy
*  I
*  Said I'm a fake broken arm in the x-ray and his arm wasn't broken. Hey, did it like Perry you do like 21 and mean
*  There's like 0.01% of black and he just started dropping them
*  Like interviews just out of nowhere was like what the fuck is happening like Perry's a wild dude. He's hilarious
*  What does this say platinum tattooed on his eyebrow?
*  Yeah, I don't know he's a wild
*  He has a fight coming up. Yeah, who's he fighting? He's fighting someone good, right? Jeff Neil. Is he fighting Jeff Neil? Yeah
*  Whoo, that's a good fight Jeff Neil
*  Do you know who we leave out sweet? You know who we'd leave out when we're talking about welterweight and it's so fucked up Leon Edwards
*  Oh, he's one eight in a row. Well, how about Masvidal fucking sucker punches him and it cuts his face and
*  They're in the you know, the the middle of this whole thing after he knocks out till I know and he's in the heat of this
*  But it gets no traction. There was a guy whatever they actually got in the fight straight fight
*  And everyone's like yeah, but Leon nobody knows you I'm sorry
*  I know what and but he sees one that he's a monster
*  Well, he beat cowboy by decision, but cowboy was sick going into that fight
*  Yeah, not to say that Leon couldn't have won anyway, but that's there's a guy who never pulls out of a fight
*  Well last time you heard cowboy pull out of a file never you'd have to be on death's door again
*  He he's been a yes, man for the UFC's gone through so much shit kind of weighed on three days notice and fight
*  It's not necessarily even then he's a yes, man. It's like he's just down to fight
*  But for but at sometimes it's not for the best of his career
*  Like when he fought Masvidal in Denver some time the hometown after the Mike Brown fight
*  We're like, dude, you suffered a lot of damage like dude fighting your hometown. Whatever four weeks later. He's like, yeah, right
*  You know I'm saying like that usually your work because you're like you're gonna be honest with you to get to the title
*  That doesn't make a lot of sense. I'm positive that Dana's actually told him that to some at certain points
*  I'm not blaming Dana. I think that he wanted fights where Dana was like look just
*  Slow down. I'm sure I'm in but I guess wild man. He's a wild dude, but it's paid. Usually it doesn't pay off
*  It's paid off. He got his golden news goose
*  Well, he's in an interesting stage where he's doing a lot of fights. So he's really comfortable fighting, right?
*  he's fighting very regularly and
*  he also's
*  you know at that age where his brain and his his knowledge of
*  Fighting and his fight IQ is at its highest while his body's still hanging in there hanging in there
*  But there's a fine line where it's let's say you were yeah knocked up by gate you right?
*  Yeah, so let's say Connor knocks out then it's like right. What's right?
*  Are we doing exactly because you're in he's like 36 now?
*  How old 36 37 so this is you know, this is the area right from 36 to 40 is where you see, you know
*  Some guys Bernard Hopkins it and they just fucking eat nothing but grilled chicken with perfectly cooked vegetables
*  That's the exception in the most except he's the
*  Most odd exception because Bernard Hopkins was elite as a boxer with no drugs. No nothing also
*  Mma really can't get away also could control the pace where he could dictate like how fast you guys fought
*  So nobody could just put a pace on him. I don't like that. No, it's a different animal
*  Completely different animal and the only guys have really made it successfully deep in their 40s were not on the match
*  No, you know, I mean, it's tough. It's tough. It's tough. And you know the early days of fighting man
*  You've got to realize like
*  The early days everything has to have an asterisk
*  Everything every kind of is the Wild West was like everyone did it
*  You know, because it was kind of a level playing field speaking of what you see Vtor getting ready for one FC
*  Back to get some throwing fast combinations looking juicy
*  I love that big again. What weight is he fighting at? Is he fighting at 205 205, right?
*  Does it say the boys thick dude? He's big in a good way
*  How many more years do you think he can have under those?
*  looser guidelines I
*  Think does it for three more years won't even let you side in the country to watch now
*  You can't get out now, but but if we don't even do it out out get the we don't have anything to do it out
*  Oh
*  Singapore out out
*  That's right. He's won championship, huh? Yeah
*  Dude
*  Fuck, I mean, of course he is come on son. Just says that dad. He's wife. They're helping him. Oh, yeah
*  Why wouldn't yeah, they're the only one piss. He's like take my piss you take my this stuff's perfect
*  I'm eating whole foods going to yoga class. Yeah, they're killing it
*  Sage is gonna fight again, too. He's gonna drop down to 55. So here he is. Get ready. Oh, yeah, dude
*  I mean, he's thick
*  And he doesn't have to cut weight. So that's where it gets interesting because you know
*  You got to realize that Vtor has been fighting in the UFC at 185 pounds for
*  You know all the big fights right the fight with Anderson that he's fighting
*  Anderson that he lost and then the Anderson fight
*  You know, he was a little smooth in that fight
*  He didn't look like the Vtor that fought Rockhold or the Vtor that fought Michael Bisping or Henderson
*  That was the thick Vtor. So we're dealing with a different animal. What poor soul is gonna fight Vtor in the juice?
*  Hey, man, I mean isn't enough at this age, you know, is it enough?
*  You know, I mean, they've got some straight-up murderers over in one FC
*  They do they do that fucking guy who knocked out Eddie Alvarez, what's his name? Sorry, you can sorry you can
*  How about the guy who beat Brandon Vero man, like they have some killers?
*  No, that's not sorry. You can what is his name? Oh nasty you can that's his name
*  I think it's Timothy nasty you can this fucking Russian savage
*  Just I didn't ask been doing work over there. Yeah, but also UFC, you know, not throw Ben asking on the bus, but UFC went
*  One championship. That's your best. Come on over
*  Yeah, but I think I think they did at the I think it paid off for the UFC because you wouldn't have
*  Mazda all super stardom without what happened Ben Askren. Yeah, I think Ben
*  You know it worked for both one championship and UFC it worked out
*  If yeah for sure and it worked for Ben to because you made a lot of money on a percent one FC
*  But I think that if Ben had left Bellator and concentrate to the UFC things would have been very interesting
*  Very interesting and I went hard in the paint for Ben. Mmm. We got starched. He got starched
*  There's a tough go starts and then strangled. Hey, it's a tough world out there and you know
*  We found out also that he needs a fucking hip replacement. Yeah legitimately does I connected him with dr. Reardon. Oh good
*  I love Panama. I love Ben, but also, you know people dogging on stuff
*  I guess like do what about what about the guy who was retired had everything going for him where he's living has the wrestling camp
*  Was like yeah. All right. I'll fight the best the best in UFC
*  Like dude right away just for him to do that. You have to tip your hat to the guy
*  Fucking insane and super nice guy very smart guy to really well again all the shit talk that's all in the act
*  I mean, it's Ben's a great dude smart smart guy. Why isn't the best idea to do that to Mazda?
*  Although what'd you say talking shit to Mazda? Well, well he but that's that's his game
*  That's just cuz you're not gonna tune into just a pure wrestler. Yeah, dude, but there's some guys
*  Oh, where my sauce like what some guys you do not want to make man, dude. How about Mazda?
*  How about Ben asking versus Damien Maya the striking I was like what the fuck is happening right now
*  Yeah, go to the ground you two right now. Yeah, what is this? I'd rather watch Logan Paul and KSI. Why is this happening?
*  Well, you got to remember Damien Maya beat Mazda. Oh the one of the last fights that Mazda lost was
*  Maya no, he I thought he'd be thinking might know he'd be Damien. I don't think Damien had his back
*  Remember and they restarted I think Damien Maya
*  Won that decision I'm pretty sure I think he lost a Wonderboy Thompson and I think he lost it
*  No, he beat Damien my ID. You're right. I think
*  Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah Mazda. Damien Maya. I thought that's
*  Losing my mind. I'm trying to remember I thought I was I feel like I want a decision. Yeah, Damien Maya one. Yeah
*  Shout out to your brain and I remember he lost a really close one to Wonderboy
*  But what's what's interesting about the the Mazda Damien Maya fight is rare Maya had his back and couldn't submit him true
*  Which is insane
*  Well, you know where Maya got fucked more than any other time in his entire career is when he had Kamaru Usman's eyes
*  Ridiculous. Oh so ugly this day to that this day. I'll be driving in my fucking car
*  Hori Mazda also Damien Maya lost burns like a fucking STD
*  Sometimes I'll be driving no bullshit
*  I'll be driving on the road and I think it Damien Maya having Kamaru Usman's back and the referee stepping in I go
*  Like this fuck just driving
*  If someone saw me driving they would think that I have some personal thing I'm dealing with
*  I'm just driving on the road thinking about that ref pulling Damien Maya off Usman's back and I just go fuck that was insane
*  It was so dumb insane. It's like he had he got to the spot. That's the spot next thing
*  You know who knows what happened. I was at the spot, but it's his spot
*  It's his spot in the world on your back the best and it's early. We're in the first round
*  He's not even slippery yet. You called the the Damien Maya
*  Asking fight to a tee I knew that we talked before like no no no
*  Yeah, I'm starting Damien Maya's gonna strangle Damien Maya's world-class on the ground and Ben eventually wants to go to the ground
*  What does he want to do have a kickboxing fight? There's gonna be moments where he wants to go to the ground
*  Okay
*  Now if you look at what and this is obviously different because it's just MMA
*  I mean, it's just grappling not MMA
*  But he rolled with Marcelo Garcia and if you watch Marcelo Garcia strangle Ben Askren over and over and over again you realize
*  There's levels to everything if they were just in a wrestling match. Yeah, Ben asking probably beat him, but this is not a wrestling match
*  This is MMA with strangles and Damien Maya is gonna get his back. That's what I was thinking
*  But also it is pretty similar to straight jiu-jitsu because Ben or Damien aren't really
*  They're literally vying for position to grapple so yeah, Ben's gonna entertain the grappling with Damien Maya
*  He's gonna slip up shit
*  He's gonna slip up and that's what I felt like he wasn't gonna be able to as Hicks and Gracie would say
*  Couldn't keep the rhythm dude. How the transitions were yeah, I
*  Foaming at the I could not get enough it when they were standing like you two fucking drop down right now
*  Yeah, stop it god damn it
*  The only thing that made sense to me is maybe Damien Maya thought that Ben Askren's chin would be soft
*  Because he was so brutally KO'd just four months ago
*  Maybe because that has happened to guys. Yeah, right. You remember when Travis Luthor?
*  Who did he fucking knock out cold with one punch?
*  That same dude who Vitor Belfort cut a giant hole above his head. He was a super jacked
*  Really powerful black dude god damn it. I can't remember his name pull up Travis Luthor not Eastman Marvin Eastman exactly
*  Marvin Eastman fought Travis Luthor and Travis Luthor caught Marvin Eastman with a punch at the very end of the punch
*  It was one of the weirder knockouts that you'll ever see go back right here right here right here watch this Oh
*  Very end of the punch very end of the punch is strange
*  But Marvin Eastman had been KO'd the word was you got killed twice in camp with Tito
*  He got hit with a knee
*  During like takedown defense got KO'd and get hit with something else. That was the word
*  I don't know if that's true if it's wrong forgive me, but it's not that Travis Luthor couldn't punch
*  He certainly could but that one didn't make sense now. I'm not like he touched him and he just went out
*  So sometimes guys who've been KO'd recently, you know, it is they just can't it just doesn't work anymore
*  You know and I would maybe I think Damien Maya maybe thought that Ben Askren took couldn't take a shot
*  That's scary when that happens in training camp cuz they're like fuck
*  You know the fights like two or three weeks away. Yeah, you know, you're not gonna be healed
*  So you go into the fight knowing you're vulnerable. Yeah, that happened before I fought Rothwell
*  He ended up knocking me out
*  But before that two weeks with a week before my last sparring session Shane Carlin knocked me literally cold
*  It's like oh, we're a week away and then you coach like yeah, I'll be alright man. You shake it off
*  In hindsight like why would you guys let me fight dude, why would you let me fight that?
*  Well, also why is Shane Carlin trying to knock you out?
*  So hard that dude hit so hard he's a guy who didn't get his day in the Sun either
*  You know, he had that loss to Lesnar we came out fuck Lesnar up in that first round
*  But then he just gassed out. He just lost all his juice. He was so true
*  He put out so much energy trying to stop Lesnar so much muscle my he just fucking gonna stop that fight to easily gonna
*  Stop that fight and not to her Dean and they were both
*  Champions he was the interim champ Lesnar was a champion Frank. Yeah. Yeah
*  He crushed Frank Mir with a ruthless series of uppercuts
*  Remember he held him with one arm as corner with the other corner fuck dude fuck dude. That was terrifying
*  That was what Shane Carlin was he was at his peak. He was starching people remember before that he
*  Starched Gabriel one punch and after he had a broken nose. It's like a broken nose. Yeah, and took him down fucked his nose up
*  Yep, Shane popped that way Shane hit him with a six inch right hand cool story like this bike
*  Shut the lights out and then how about Gonzaga and Bigfoot Silva fought bare knuckle? That's how they're doing sir
*  They found a bare knuckle and Gonzaga piece Big Silva. Yeah, it's hard to watch good
*  Big Bigfoot so it was a guy that when they made him get off the test remember that that was the rudest thing ever because
*  Don't fight if you have to have that stuff the money he needed the money
*  No, I'm saying like if you like you remember him on TRT you you was such a nightmare
*  He's crushed fator huge. He crushed fator remember that when fator went for a ankle lock on him. He just
*  Is
*  And fator's like hugging on his big toe and he's going like this
*  Yeah, I'm like you fucked up fator fucked up you let a guy get on anything. You're literally fight a giant
*  Yeah, also the nicest guy in the world super nice guy
*  But how about I was training with him and he had a real reason to take tests when you take him off of it
*  He had an operation on his pituitary gland. He had a tumor. Yeah hit a tumor that was stopped
*  I mean he was literally producing too much growth hormone
*  That's that's why you become a giant like that
*  So then he has this tumor removed and now his body's not producing anything right so he has to take stuff
*  But they say he can't take stuff so he's just sick all the time
*  I was fighting against Mark Hunt when he was on TRT and they just went back and forth
*  That's right heavyweight fight of all time afterwards
*  Take a shot. Yeah, he does
*  Yeah, dude, how about I train with Bigfoot to get ready for Big Nog?
*  And I didn't know they were like best friends and I'm training with them. Oh, this guy's great
*  Next day. I'm like where the fuck is Bigfoot? I see a picture of him on Instagram with Big Nog
*  Oh boy, so he went to test you out
*  I just think he came in and was like he was the same. I know he was training there
*  And I don't think it was any like bad intention
*  I think he was like alright. Yeah, if you want to train go ahead
*  Dude, we didn't get on top of fador when he mounted fador. I was like, oh fuck that picture
*  Just a giant on top of this kind of fat Russian
*  Dude he was a he was a building he was like a building planted on his chest like you're not shaking that off DC
*  300 pounds Merrin DC bottom and I go dude you fucked him up. He goes, how can he miss? How can he miss?
*  He goes, that's the easiest fight in the world. How do you miss? I threw a one two they both land
*  His head was this long when you catch a guy to like where you catch him in his career and all in like what kind of
*  Testing are we talking about?
*  That's the reality of like I mean MMA pre-usada is all when you catch them and what kind of testing?
*  Yeah, what's well speaking of testing? How about your boy over and fight Saturday?
*  Don't don't don't he's fighting a fucking Rosenstrike. Is it strike or struke strike strike? Yeah
*  He's a banshee. Yeah, he's a beast. He KO'd
*  And
*  Andre I'll ask you with a left hook fadeaway left hook his last fight one punch
*  Serious power really nice guy, too. Is he nice real nice? I
*  Can't be no DC. What a cool name. Jarzy. No, Jarzy. No, it wasn't strike. God. Look at him
*  I would have to go to John
*  To see John Anik to see if I'm saying it right, but I'm pretty sure it's roses stroke
*  Rook Rosen strike six very interesting very
*  Interesting guy
*  He's one of those guys when you look at the other doing a leg reach thing now
*  He's one of those guys when you get a guy who's you know, I think he's nine
*  No, is that what it says nine to know? Yeah, I mean you don't know yes, too
*  We don't know but it's a good tail ratio 88%
*  Fuck man, and he's a legit 260 plus, you know
*  He's a legit giant you're fucking crazy if you don't think Rosenstruck and Francis are gonna face off whoo
*  What I want to see
*  Honestly, I want to see Francis fight in boxing. I really do. How dare you? I really do. I really do
*  I really got a guy like Wilder. Well, not right away
*  I don't think that would be smart. No, I think you'd have a few boxing fights
*  But I think Francis could put people on the moon. That's a fact you get some dude is not gonna take him down
*  I'm just gonna stand in front of him. It's trouble
*  280 plus pounds right now
*  Yeah, right. He's been left in muscle dude. He's such a specimen
*  He's such a freak and I mean he's got a story that is literally right out of a movie
*  He was a child working in the fucking sand mines
*  Digging sand that is core that is shoulders that is legs that is back
*  That kind of strength training as a young person doing that every day that farmer strength shit
*  That's for real man for real you go against a farmer, you know, it's
*  Sand shoveling strength my top farmer strength because farmers aren't always doing that
*  Blood diamonds
*  I can take it too man. I love take shots
*  Here's what this route Francis to is obviously at his loss, right?
*  Lost a steep a and then the Derek Lewis whatever that fight was whatever I want to erase
*  But so he loses to steep a he gets catapulted into the limelight he's pretty cocky thinks he's gonna start steep a
*  But then he learns from his losses and you look where he's at now. You're like, oh shit
*  This guy's gonna be champion. Yeah similar thing happen with Darren Tillman. I went to see I saw the junior dos Santos fight in a pool
*  Hall I was with some guys and we were playing pole and we stopped and I said this one won't last
*  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna say this is not gonna last junior is a great fighter
*  But he's just his style is the wrong style to stand in front of that fucking guy
*  You also have some Brazilian miles on him. Yes, there's a he's a shell of what he used to be. Let's be real
*  Yeah, so in yet the Francis is just on this tear right now
*  But there's sometimes you know, there's losses that happen for guys where you're like, oh man
*  Like they needed those huge bumps in their in their career where it's gonna make them it's gonna pay off in the end
*  I think it's happening with Francis. It's happening with Darren Till now as well. I don't know if
*  Francis can
*  Immediately beat top-level boxers, but I know that if they put him against some guy who's like a journeyman who's gonna stand
*  Oh, he'll start them house starch guys and he'll start a bunch of those guys bunch of those guys people get super excited
*  You're talking about a day
*  I agree if they want to do that
*  But you're talking about a different animal if you were to go in there like a wild or a fury
*  Which is almost ridiculous to say but that's where we're at cuz Conor D. It's Floyd
*  But you know or even Mazda talking about oh, I want to fight Canelo and they ask Canel can I goes what the fuck you?
*  Talking about but so but I know I think with Francis if you put him in there with a guy like Wilder or fury
*  They've seen big punches before man. He's not gonna touch him. There's just a different level, but you might be it
*  He's also older. So I don't know fury is a perfect example of a guy. That's extremely hard to hit
*  He's so light on his feet. He pops that jab
*  He's so well schooled one of the things that I saw when I watched the fight again
*  Was like how how well he was slipping punch master class in boxing good
*  He's by far the most
*  Skilled heavyweight we've seen I don't know how long and six nine insane
*  He's so tall and he just pops that jabs you see you work with till yes. Yes till was like
*  Fuck dude like and he was like I want a real workout
*  Give me what you guys would do until said he was whole mitts and like holy fuck man
*  Of course man, and and now imagine him with four ounce gloves lighten your chin up. He's just too fast
*  But it's whether or not he would ever be able to stop like steep a takedown or DC's takedown or any real heavyweight
*  Restless now. No
*  I don't know why everyone wants to cross pollinate
*  You stay there
*  I think the guy who can have the most success is Francis because I really think that Francis before he gets to the elite levels
*  He's gonna starch a lot of people. I don't know if he can punch as hard as Wilder
*  I don't know because Wilder's punch is crazy insane
*  But so is Francis's if Francis hits anyone with that left hook
*  I don't give a fuck if he's wearing one of those cartoon gloves that you get they weigh five pounds
*  You know those ones you get I know exactly
*  But here's the thing you know who ate his punches
*  Steep a he did but steep a moved away and uses wrestling be still be see big fucking rock
*  You go back once I thought you like oh
*  Can steep a do this if he ragged all them amazing?
*  But
*  What how much different would that fight be if it was just a boxing match?
*  That's trouble if there was no takedowns at all and he could settle in he knocked him out
*  Maybe maybe who knows maybe steep able to fought a different fight. What do you think steep a DC?
*  The rematch is that definitely gonna happen they confirmed that I think steep a am I fucking crazy steep?
*  He's got an injury that he's dealing with that. I think am I fucking crazy is that I'm from
*  I don't think it's confirmed. I think they both agreed to it, but it hasn't been confirmed
*  It hasn't been signed dude wait till John goes hold my fucking bear and comes up the heavyweight
*  I've seen what that man does the heavyweights in training
*  Well, you know the Johnny Walker thing was what was really interesting right is really interesting to see if Johnny Walker could make a big
*  Splash, but then people forgot how goddamn good Corey Anderson is they forgot the MMA guys
*  Don't care about your hype or you're fucking dancing into the cage
*  You knock a lot of guys out. They don't give a fuck
*  How good are you right now and do you have a solution to what Corey Anderson brings to the table?
*  He's a beast man. He's a beast. He's a beast. He's got an incredible work ethic
*  He doesn't get fucking tired and he gets better with every fight and people forget you forget he gets better
*  But go but you gotta watch the Lear Latifi fight. Yeah, shut that guy down stops Johnny Walker
*  He's beating top-level guys man. How about Latifi's heavyweight now? I know I'm not crazy
*  I
*  See baby, oh chick wants Tyson Fury super fight more than Daniel Cormier trilogy of course he does
*  It's like a huge paid fucking billion dollars
*  Those have made a little bit cuz DC made him wait for his rematch. So he said I'll make him wait to then
*  Oh, well, yeah, he's probably talking shit. Both you fight to your nuts hang down here. Just fucking make it happen. I
*  Don't know if that fight happens again
*  Don't know what happens again, I don't know we'll talk I'll tell you what I know. Yeah, please do
*  Yeah, it's just a matter of time for John goes. I am ready to go and just fucks everybody up
*  Well DC John heavyweight dear God make it happen. Oh my god. What do you think about John versus Francis though?
*  Every fight starts standing up man
*  Yeah, that does the princess air fire big that's terrifying. Can John get in there fast enough to get down
*  He's cutting weight to make 265 understand that
*  I'm cutting weight cutting weight and he's putting people on another dimension. My only thing is
*  Just gonna power punch it all right 100%
*  However, he ain't seen nothing like that guy
*  No
*  Nothing when that guy kicks his leg that guy comes storming in like a bat out of hell
*  throwing punches that each one of them has
*  Concussion written all over it each one of them anything lands on anybody and you're a 205 er
*  I mean the best 205 of all time no doubt
*  But if we saw John get left hooked like the way we saw Gregor Gillespie get head kicked and just flatline
*  Dubs and sand shut out the girl
*  I know and I was thinking that was a really tough fight for Kevin. We both were I was like
*  Why would Kevin do this Kevin look phenomenal?
*  Well, listen man the training with for us a hobby and making that move getting a real camp real sparring partners a real game plan
*  And a real real maestro to yes like a master like you have to have it today
*  You have to have it today if you're gonna compete against the best and for us is just one of the best ever
*  I told him that I'm like, that's the guy who trained the guy who you fight like the most
*  Go there be that guy. Yeah, be that guy do that. Yeah move your ass to coal ass, Montreal
*  Yeah, no black people do that
*  They speak French though. They rap in French. Have you ever heard French rapping? Oh, yeah, that's all adorable
*  GSP plays it in his car. Well, this is terrible. Could you please switch the station?
*  GSP is still training still training still in tip-top Magoo. He's looking for a big fight. Yeah, he said look I'm here boys
*  What do you want to do? He wants the cabib one that could be once that 65 bro him and could be that 165 would be gang
*  Busters insane and he can make 165. He makes he thinks he can make 55
*  Yeah, let's not do it let's not do a show Jesus Christ when TG you know
*  Like I don't know what TJ was doing before he was doing this because yeah busting. Yeah, because um
*  You know, they don't test for EPO every fight they don't know they don't
*  Cut yeah, why Cody Cody Garbrandt said that he was he'd been on it before and Cody and him were friends
*  I don't know if that's true
*  But I do know that when you look at the way he looked when he was training for that 125 pound fight
*  He looked like he was a dead man walking. I couldn't imagine that he had any energy to train. I can't imagine it
*  I almost understand why he would take something. I almost understand exactly
*  I said them except if Cody's telling the truth if Cody's done it before done it before the team
*  Well, you know team alpha has their issues with TJ and they've assumed he was on it before
*  Is that the case though or was he friends with Cody and Cody knew I don't know I don't know I don't know either way
*  Again props to you Sada because they're catching people doing shit like that. Look, he should have never gone to 125
*  No, I mean that guy that is training him that guy who's that master strength conditioning coach to put together this diet drop down
*  125 pounds that's all good on paper. Okay, that's all good on paper
*  And I know he's trained a bunch of like really top-level
*  Here 100% that's a ridiculous idea that's too much weight it's too much weight there's that also
*  Jose Aldo's team who's like no he can make 135. I'm like
*  He looks like he's lost a lot of weight dying at 45, but he looks like he lost a lot of weight
*  Have you seen the recent pictures of him? Nope don't need to cuz here's the thing
*  They're like, oh you were you know, you got kind of pieced up at 45 and you're older dude
*  Let's cut a shit ton of weight and see how that goes
*  Why not 55 I hear what you're saying, but I don't think he's actually cutting weight
*  I think what he's done is lose weight lose weight like it's not I need to do it going slowly because
*  He's way out from a fight, right? He's already fighting
*  December 15 Marlon Marais, is that what it is? Yeah
*  That's fairly soon
*  That's a good fight Brazilian Brazilian crime. Nothing better
*  Dude Marlon before say who don't got a hold of him
*  He literally a world beater like he was gonna beat the world who don't broke broke him bro
*  What that fucking will on him son put that will on him? So here's the question
*  Is Marlon Marais in a similar situation where he just can't maintain a pace?
*  After cutting that much weight because Marais cuts a fuckload of weight. There it is
*  Jermaine demand to me Peter. Yon Uriah Amanda Nunes and Duran to me is uh
*  That's a fight that people are not talking about enough Duran to me is good
*  She's good super technical when she refused to fight cyborgs. Yeah, I'll just give up the belt fuck this noise
*  No, you can kiss this ass
*  Kiss this Dutch ass
*  Interested dude
*  Volkonovsky versus Max Holloway is a good fucking fight. You ever see Volkonovsky when he's 240. Yeah, it's fantastic rugby player
*  Yeah, it's five six to 40. He's from Izzy same camp. Yes. He's an animal
*  They got some boys over there and Max Holloway, Max Holloway consensus greatest featherweight of all time
*  Yeah of all time of all time. He's the best beat the shit out of Aldo twice twice beat the shit out of Ortega
*  No, keep going one more John John
*  Kamara Ousmane and Colby Covington
*  No, John Jones is the what is that? What is he?
*  Is that the other Vegas one
*  Right, that's February that's February Houston Oh
*  Come on, who's Monica? We covered him. Give me that again. Let me see that again
*  That's a good
*  respond Colby covered in good luck calling that
*  What do you think happens there? I don't know both both their styles are very similar
*  The only difference on that you can really see neither guys ever been taken down a fight ever
*  But I would give the finishing power to Kamara Ousmane. I would as well. He has some power
*  He does here's some power about Colby with Robbie Lawler. Oh, yeah, just outstruck him. Yeah. Yeah insane
*  Well, not only that puts a pace on that you just can't handle you can't handle it
*  But if anybody can handle it, it's that guy just think about it. It was mine did Woodley
*  Yeah, take down defense a hundred percent Kamara Ousmane a hundred
*  How's the fuck is Colby 78 who took him down? No one took him down. Maybe his first fight. Didn't he get submitted?
*  He had a broken rib
*  Took a fight early in his career injured. I think to get into the UFC really in losses that submitted
*  I want to say it was his first fight go to Colby Covington's first fight in the octagon
*  Oh, that's what they can do Woodley Leon Edwards. Oh
*  Just hit me that's a tough fight tough fight for both guys good fight very good fight
*  What is it guillotine who in first fight in the UFC
*  He was I made him eight in one
*  Who are you talking about in the UFC eight and one of the UFC how many fights in was it?
*  Really who did it?
*  Yeah, Lee Alvis, that's right. That was the fight that he got injured Warley Alvis was a beast
*  Yeah, he's kind of falling off, but he was on he was a beast
*  But did I'm assuming Colby shot in well Colby went into that fight with a fucked-up rib
*  I know that for a fact, but did he shoot and get guillotined?
*  I don't remember
*  He was hurt I know for sure and then who did he fight after that because let me tell you the fight that made
*  Him put on this act
*  Put his record
*  Was yeah, well he was fucked up. I know for sure he was fucked up going to that fight
*  That was a fight didn't want to take cuz him and chael are close and she was like you need to come up with a
*  Stick dude, do you think so 100% okay? Let me see make that a little bigger for my shitty eyes um
*  Go no scroll up. Okay there it is Rita there. It is it was I think it was uh
*  When he was was it when he was fighting Damian Maya they started talking shit
*  Where's that Sao Paulo? Yep? That's exactly what yeah, that's exactly where so he's fighting Damian Maya filthy animals
*  Yeah, he called them filthy animals so apparently what was going on before then was he was not making enough noise
*  There was no one gave a fuck about him
*  You know they're in the middle of contract negotiations, and I think they were threatening to cut him
*  so he says all kinds of crazy shit about Damian Maya and
*  People pay attention they go okay, okay? How about this? We'll give you another Brazilian, so they give him half a lot of Sanjos
*  He beats the fuck out of half a lot of Sanjos, and then they're like holy shit wait a minute here wait a minute
*  So in doing that he wins the interim title, and then there was a bunch of shenanigans
*  They wanted him to fight in Madison Square Garden
*  He said look I can't fight back to back that quick these are hard-ass camp
*  So they strip them a lot of shit going on a lot of shit
*  So then they bring him back against Robbie Lawler big comeback fight Robbie Lawler is a murderer right?
*  Yeah, big fight on ESPN, and he just runs him over man runs him over like Robbie never got air
*  He never got air and we just stayed on him stayed on me look at his record right the last
*  Six all five last five all decisions, so it's like if you're like any good all this guy
*  He doesn't finish, but what he's doing a guy's like Damian Maya and dos and Joe's and Robbie Lawler's so fun to watch
*  He's breaking dudes. He's this is crazy October of 2017, so it's basically two years old this act
*  And I can't we fights old I can't wait for him to drop it
*  I can't wait for him to drop it once he becomes a champ and tell
*  You know why he didn't keep it going cuz he has he wants to go to WWE
*  Yeah, that's his thing cuz smart. Yeah, I'm not man. He's like I won't go WWE
*  He becomes a champ and then goes WWE and they put him on all the steroids
*  Why not and they get him up to about 240 keep the hat keep the gimmick on?
*  Make bank shake it yeah, tell him I'm gonna show you you pussies how to really fight fantastic
*  How about him versus Lesnar?
*  Dude you'll see that you'll see that Lesnar fought a little dude the other day
*  Well, that was fucking crazy. That's what he wants to do. Hey, why not man?
*  You can make money, you know at a certain point time you got to go
*  You know he accomplished a lot. He's accomplished a lot
*  I said if he decides if he beats us man always like how am I gonna parlay this and how am I gonna keep this guy?
*  Cuz everybody knows fighting you know it's a finite window like what are you gonna do next?
*  Nobody knows what his body's like right now as far as injuries and how many guys do you know that are in camp that have
*  One fucked up knee or a weird shoulder or the neck keeps fucking with especially for his skill set
*  Yeah, that motor and that grind like he's a grinder so you gotta have it all man
*  I would like to watch his strength and conditioning workout because it must be fucking insane
*  It must be insane because even Horray Mazenal off record. I was talking to him. I go. What do you think about Colby?
*  We've trained together goes never seen a motor like that ever in my life. He sees a mother. He can go man
*  He can go he can go he put it on Robbie Lauer like I never seen anybody put it on crazy the pace
*  The pace was just insane. He just never gave him any air just kept on him bang bang bang
*  I go I go. What do you use I go you going 50 60 percent he goes yeah
*  Yeah, just volume just never never throwing full blast just staying on you very Nate Nick deals
*  People forget but those guys started that long Nick started it Nick started if you go back to watch his fight with Frank Shamrock
*  He just never gave Frank Shamrock any breaks
*  Just stays on it's not like exploding right just staying volume until he gets you hurt
*  Then he starts ripping to the body then dig into the body and he starts letting you know
*  I'm not even a little tired bitch, and you're exhausted. He starts putting it on you. Whoa. It's on and
*  To the Nate Diaz thing. I think you know Connor goes. I want to fight three times in
*  2020 I think he goes if I've got a crystal ball on the screws your McDuck of the UFC I think he goes
*  Cowboy Maz of it all and ends it with Nate Diaz
*  Money money money money money money money why not right because I think Tony and Khabib are gonna tie up 155 for a while
*  I think those those boys can be it's back and forth to sit
*  I think it's gonna be a great trilogy for the division dude. I'm so excited about that fight
*  That's my number one fight of the year number one fight don't get fucked about anything else
*  I want to talk about a lot of else. I give me everything else
*  I need that fights important, but it's in April. It's in Brooklyn. It might not even happen
*  Just wrap it just I'm saying that because there's no way I could predict that this fight would get cancelled
*  So I'm saying that so the people can make fun of me. It's the fifth time actually happen
*  You know what be great if the UFC just doesn't tell us and then the week before they go
*  Ferguson Khabib this Saturday like oh fuck. Yeah, I'm using reverse psychology
*  Sometimes we jinx fights, dude. I'm serious about Francis and Gallo though. I think he could be a real heavyweight contender in boxing
*  I agree. That's the one thing I'm not fucking around about I want anybody to get it twisted
*  I really think that guy is so fucking hard and he's so good at fighting now and he's so good at fighting high level
*  You know he's been fighting in the UFC against high level guys for a long
*  I know it's different
*  But I don't think there's that much of an adjustment when you think about his primary skill set and the division he's talking about
*  You don't think he could start some of those like top 15 guys
*  He could fuck some of those dudes up. I don't know
*  Goddamn mine if you think it hang with wild or fury. I'm not saying right away
*  I'm not saying right away, but you got it. You got a single experience under your belt
*  You got to see some fireworks. How many pro boxing fights does he even have?
*  Think about how many Wilder has. Does he have any?
*  We don't even know. I don't think so. Connor had zero and he fought the best ever. How'd that go?
*  Not great, did it? Although he did land some punches like I guarantee. He landed a beautiful left uppercut. Told ya. Beautiful left uppercut.
*  Francis lands that on wild or fury. It's game over. It's interesting. Maybe not, you know, maybe they can take it
*  Maybe they can maybe he can you know hurt him? Maybe they can roll with it a little bit better Wilder takes it, dude
*  That's the thing about Wilder. He takes it. He's got a tremendous chin
*  So does Joshua eats it too man. Joshua will get hit. He's been wobbled before the Dillon White fight
*  He's been he's been wobbled man. Well, Klichko clocked by Klichko. Yeah, so that's why I think against Wilder man
*  Because there's no Wilder lands. It's game set match. It's over. What do you what did you think about Canelo fighting?
*  Sergey Kovalev how crazy was that?
*  Do you flatline Sergey Kovalev at 175 pounds? How good is Canelo? He's a man. He's pound for pound number one
*  He was his resume. Everyone goes ooh bud who I love but Crawford shot the bud bud and
*  Earl Spence everyone goes that's pound for round number one or
*  Dude, look at who canelos has beat man in different divisions
*  You're talking about fucking marquee guys and he's stopping on man the triple G fights
*  Obviously, there's some controversy there, but the triple G fights a real country for the first one was very controversial
*  Yeah, second one second one not so much. What's up? I delayed his fight for the end of the UFC fight
*  Yes, they did and he's mad at that. He said no more because apparently people were tired man, especially like East Coast
*  Did you watch it? I was yeah, I watched it. It was insane. Yeah, they delayed it forever four hours
*  They show him yeah in the back sitting there like what the fighting for the end of the UFC fight and disowned
*  Just like how about does own play the UFC in the arena look at this laugh my off who wrote that who wrote that tweet?
*  Oh
*  Impersonator Ryan was it say let me shout him out. It says it chew defense Imperator Ryan the chew defense Twitter
*  It says LMAO canal and Kovalov are napping because they got a weight on the UFC. It's ridiculous
*  Like show a little pride to zone Dana loved it. I loved it. He was so happy as a UFC guy
*  I was also like he was so average like what this is who's king you got can you imagine?
*  Can you imagine Dana bowing down to the going? Listen Floyd's fighting. We're not gonna we're gonna wait for the main
*  The UFC doesn't give a fuck what you got going on
*  How is Nate Diaz versus Maz would always a special fight too and the thing about making it for the bad motherfucker belt
*  Almost like everybody was like yes
*  Why not? Why not?
*  You know and now
*  Isn't you wanna young J check gonna fight John wheeling isn't she fighting her for the belt?
*  Oh did they know if you want to they didn't give her that fight you want to say she wants to fight for the female
*  BMF bout
*  She should fight Jessica and Raj in a rematch
*  Some fucking card
*  So it's not been announced yet, so that's the one they think might be
*  Adesanya and yoel Romero so Dana said he didn't want that fight though
*  Dana said he did yeah Dana said he didn't want that fight cuz yoel lost his last guy
*  I thought he said he did want it. No Dana said he personally Dana didn't think that was a good fight for yoel
*  But think about what else is there? What's a great fight for yoel? I think it's I mean for Adesanya
*  I think they fight for the division, but who else are you gonna do you look at the division?
*  Well one of the things that Mazda who's friends with yoel said I respect the fuck out of Adesanya cuz he asked for that beast
*  He said he asked for him and that was my point with Andrew Schultz and like no you don't understand to build the legend of izzy
*  Him asking for yoel
*  Everybody in the game respects that you want to fight that fucking monster even Darren till Darren till said anybody but yoel
*  Yes, joking around after the fight. I don't want to fight. He's joking. Yeah, I think they're gonna do Darren till Whitaker man
*  That's a great fucking fight. Well, they talked about doing that
*  On the undercard of Adesanya yoel Romero. Yes, wasn't that no no no no no it was the undercard of
*  That was the undercard of another fight
*  Fuck what did he say he reached out to so oh Connor and cowboy
*  That's who it was he wanted to be on the undercard of Connor too soon not happening
*  I don't know and I don't think Whitaker be ready to go by then after again. What is it? What's the date on January January?
*  December dude right, but it's six weeks
*  Dantel breaks out as red panties invites Robert Whitaker to UFC 246 co-main event
*  Yeah, so that's six weeks. The only thing is Robert Whitaker got starched. Yeah, just a couple of months
*  So you get an 120 day suspension right? Well, I don't know if you actually can make that
*  Medically no, that's what I'm saying. It's not gonna happen. It's too soon
*  Also, I think a fight like that where you know a guy like Adesanya just sort of starches you like that that requires a
*  Take your time. Yeah, I love Whitaker. Yeah, I do too, but maybe not. I mean, maybe he knows better than us
*  I don't know. No, no, you think so. I don't think so. I'm outside looking in I'd say no be nice
*  I'm don't do take your time. I don't think he does take your time, but I would like to see that fight, too
*  So maybe they can make that happen on
*  You know that March card would yeah, or maybe yeah, maybe sometime in the future
*  There was a there's a great April card as well, right April is
*  The UFC in Brooklyn with Tony and Khabib maybe could be on the undercard of that be great. That's great. Fuck. Yeah
*  That's great. Fine. It's a good time to be a fight fan, man. It's a good time
*  Man, good time good shit. Yeah. Yeah, I get home to my son, dude. Yeah
*  T fat k.com when we at next
*  Friday and Saturday and then Kansas City. I know yeah, I haven't been I've only did the Stanford and so it's a newer one
*  I think I think yeah, and then so next week first time on Borgata Atlantic City. That's a fun fun gig
*  Is it fun? I'm excited for a lot of animals
*  I'm also chill watching throwing money at the audience really throwing hundreds price through $10,000 the audience. I love this guy
*  I brought him on stage. I'm like throwing money smelled terrible, but he threw a lot of money at people
