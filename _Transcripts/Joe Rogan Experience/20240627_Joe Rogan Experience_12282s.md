# Joe Rogan Experience #1944 - Ryan Long
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=0.0s)]
*  I hold the record. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6.0s)]
*  What do you hold the record for? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=13.0s)]
*  Longest bottle reused in my podcast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=15.0s)]
*  Of water? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=19.0s)]
*  Two years I had the same bottle. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=20.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, until the guy I did the podcast with was like, the amount of carcinogenics must [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=23.0s)]
*  be running through your body. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=27.0s)]
*  So were you just adding water to it all the time? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, every day I'd come in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm the ultimate environmentalist, really. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=32.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's bad for you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=34.0s)]
*  I think what's bad for you is just drinking on a plastic period. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=36.0s)]
*  Like if your bottle is sitting there filled with water for months and months on a shelf, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=40.0s)]
*  wouldn't that leech more plastic in it than water that you just pour in there? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would seem to me that like the real fear would be, I think, correct me if I'm [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=52.0s)]
*  wrong because I'm definitely wrong. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=57.0s)]
*  Propaganda. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=59.0s)]
*  I think the real fear is the heat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=60.0s)]
*  I think when you like have plastic bottles or sitting outside in the sun. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah, I leave them in the sun. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=69.0s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=70.0s)]
*  I like them to marinate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=71.0s)]
*  That's when you get all the phthalates in your dick shrinks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=73.0s)]
*  That's what's happening to people, you know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=76.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, sorry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're already starting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=80.0s)]
*  Okay, we're starting? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=82.0s)]
*  Did you see, well I just read this, the dicks have enlarged in the last... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=83.0s)]
*  I know, I thought dicks were shrinking. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=87.0s)]
*  I just saw a new study. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=89.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=90.0s)]
*  And it's a problem. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=91.0s)]
*  Mine's been shrinking. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=92.0s)]
*  It might be a problem. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=93.0s)]
*  That was what was hilarious. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=94.0s)]
*  Dicks are getting bigger and this could be a real issue. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=95.0s)]
*  Like how? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=97.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=98.0s)]
*  How? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=99.0s)]
*  Rulers got smaller. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=100.0s)]
*  Rulers got smaller. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=101.0s)]
*  People just started lying. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=102.0s)]
*  That is the South Park episode where they go, yeah, we just changed the measurements. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=103.0s)]
*  We went down to, we just started measuring, how did they get smaller? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=107.0s)]
*  We started measuring in millimeters. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=110.0s)]
*  Bro, when I was a kid they tried to put us on the metric system, which is a far more efficient system. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=111.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=115.0s)]
*  System of tens. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=116.0s)]
*  Stanford scope. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=117.0s)]
*  An increase in penile length caused for concern? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=118.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=120.0s)]
*  What are you concerned about? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=121.0s)]
*  It's cause for concern for the ladies, you know? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah, what are you concerned about? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=124.0s)]
*  Ladies are walking funny to work every day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=125.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=127.0s)]
*  A rect penile length is getting longer from an average of 4.8 inches. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=128.0s)]
*  Go to that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=131.0s)]
*  What does it say there? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=132.0s)]
*  Oh, that was the best article. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=135.0s)]
*  Here's why this is actually a problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=136.0s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=138.0s)]
*  No, this was, I think this was originally a Vice article. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=139.0s)]
*  This one, this is from a couple years ago and it was a guy writing how actually small dicks are kind of better if you think about it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=142.0s)]
*  Oh, sure buddy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=148.0s)]
*  No women are writing that article. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=151.0s)]
*  That's such, it's so sad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=154.0s)]
*  The penis size is so sad. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=155.0s)]
*  There's not a damn thing they could do about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=156.0s)]
*  They could put a man on the moon, they can't make your dick bigger. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=158.0s)]
*  They have not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=161.0s)]
*  They do the enlargement, but it doesn't work all that great. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=162.0s)]
*  There was a guy, actually a bit about, there was a guy, his name is Ahud Laniandro and he got the best dick enlargement money could buy because he's like a billionaire dude, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=166.0s)]
*  And then he died during the thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=175.0s)]
*  Died during the enlargement. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=178.0s)]
*  Oh, he probably died from the anesthesia, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=180.0s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, getting put under is no joke. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=183.0s)]
*  Getting put under, you know, it's, they're very, very, very, very good at it now, but it still carries some risks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=185.0s)]
*  Or, yeah, in the dick, they made him such a good dick, the doctor was like, I can't let this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=192.0s)]
*  He had it poisoned him in case his wife saw that dick. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=197.0s)]
*  No one can, yeah, this is, I can't let this be a Frankenstein situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=200.0s)]
*  It is my masterpiece. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=203.0s)]
*  I can't allow this, walking the earth, just punishing women. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=204.0s)]
*  That would be the number one industry in the country if there was an actual dick enlargement product. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=209.0s)]
*  Like they just nailed it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=216.0s)]
*  It would be bigger than Apple. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=219.0s)]
*  In like a week. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=220.0s)]
*  I mean, Viagra, it's like, who, the amount of people that take that recreationally is very crazy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=222.0s)]
*  It's probably their most profitable thing other than vaccines, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=228.0s)]
*  For Pfizer? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=232.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=233.0s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=234.0s)]
*  Well, imagine vaccines would be Viagra if the government was like, you have to take it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=235.0s)]
*  Also, we're paying for it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=240.0s)]
*  Imagine if the government just said, listen, more people have to fuck because we need more people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=243.0s)]
*  We have to compete with China. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=248.0s)]
*  And so Viagra is mandatory. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=249.0s)]
*  So everyone just has wood. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=251.0s)]
*  Everywhere you go, at every bar, everywhere you go, dudes just have raging hard-ons that are mandated by the government. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=253.0s)]
*  Mandated by the government, paid for by the government. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=260.0s)]
*  And yeah, your chick's like, why are you always hard? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=262.0s)]
*  And you're like, talk to Biden. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=264.0s)]
*  You think I want this? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=265.0s)]
*  It's Kamala Harris. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=266.0s)]
*  It's her, she has an issue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=267.0s)]
*  She wants us to do this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=270.0s)]
*  No, this is. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=272.0s)]
*  This is her issue she's pushing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=273.0s)]
*  That's the socialized boners. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=274.0s)]
*  It's not socialized medicine for anything but boners. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=276.0s)]
*  Well, there are people that do believe that more people are supposed to be having children because they do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=278.0s)]
*  There's people like Elon, who's far smarter than me, who thinks that we have a there's an issue with a possible population collapse. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=283.0s)]
*  Like not enough people are having kids. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=292.0s)]
*  And even though there's a lot of people alive right now, the numbers of people having kids are dropping off. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=294.0s)]
*  And that if you that keeps going, there's like a trend that that happens. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=300.0s)]
*  If it doesn't like correct itself, it could be a real issue. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=304.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that kind of take the opinion on that, too, where you go, not only is it a problem, it's already like too far to fix. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=307.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that are like, there's not even really a way out of this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=316.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, Ryan, you're scaring the shit out of me. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=320.0s)]
*  Well, I think the way out is probably, you know, technology and stuff like that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=323.0s)]
*  Right. But yeah, probably. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=327.0s)]
*  If you look at the birth rates, there I guess, you know, certain countries you can take more immigrants and stuff like that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=328.0s)]
*  But yeah, there is not. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=335.0s)]
*  Well, we're taking a lot of immigrants. Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=337.0s)]
*  You know, it's really fascinating. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=339.0s)]
*  The immigrant thing is fascinating because, you know, my grandparents were immigrants. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=341.0s)]
*  So like watching immigrants come into this country from I mean, I am personally an immigrant. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=346.0s)]
*  Are you really? Yeah. Where were you born? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=352.0s)]
*  Toronto, Canada. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=354.0s)]
*  That doesn't count. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=355.0s)]
*  I mean, you guys are our cousins. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=356.0s)]
*  You're in the family. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=358.0s)]
*  You know what? When I tried to move here, I said to that, I would go, come on, really, is it? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=359.0s)]
*  But it is. You got to get the green card. You got to do the whole thing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=363.0s)]
*  There's a certain amount a year. They have rules about it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=365.0s)]
*  Yeah. But if you just come in through the border, you're good. Just walk in. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=367.0s)]
*  Just fly to Mexico and walk in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=370.0s)]
*  I just point to my face. I go, I'm white. Can we? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=372.0s)]
*  They just let you in. I'm telling you, they don't even care if you're vaccinated. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=374.0s)]
*  I go, cut the shit. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=377.0s)]
*  You know, you can't fly into the United States still unless you're vaccinated. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=378.0s)]
*  From Canada. From other countries. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=382.0s)]
*  Oh, from other countries. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=384.0s)]
*  I think. Isn't that true? I think that's still true. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=385.0s)]
*  But you can just kind of walk in. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=388.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of people just kind of walking in. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=391.0s)]
*  Like there's too many people coming across. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=394.0s)]
*  From certain countries, you have to get visas for it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=396.0s)]
*  Like you can't just, because I remember, you know, my friend who lived in Canada, people were going to, you know, Mexico or somewhere or the US. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=398.0s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, I can't go there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=404.0s)]
*  And we're like, well, we're just going on like vacation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=405.0s)]
*  We're going to go party in like, you know, Nashville or whatever. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=407.0s)]
*  And he's like, I can't, you can do that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=409.0s)]
*  Like, I can't do that. He's from India. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=411.0s)]
*  He can't just go to America. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah. You have to be vaccinated and you have to have some sort of paperwork, right? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah. You got to get a visa. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=419.0s)]
*  You have to get a visa to visit. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=421.0s)]
*  A visiting visa. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=423.0s)]
*  Wow. Isn't that wild? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=424.0s)]
*  No, it's, yeah, it is kind of wild. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=425.0s)]
*  We don't even think about that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=427.0s)]
*  We don't, you know, we have it so goddamn good here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=430.0s)]
*  We really do. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=434.0s)]
*  And the crazy gender war talk that's going on right now with it seems like there's like such a fascination with gender now. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=437.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, to the point where it's like, what, what, what is like Douglas Murray talked about this on the podcast. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=448.0s)]
*  He was saying that this happens in every civilization before it collapses. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=454.0s)]
*  People become obsessed with gender for some reason. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=458.0s)]
*  And then it's also as a comedian, you know, especially like the trans issue or whatever, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=461.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, how do you not address that when it becomes the number one? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=467.0s)]
*  This is the number one. Everyone's talking about it nonstop. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=471.0s)]
*  And then they're kind of like, oh, look at all these guys talking about this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=474.0s)]
*  And you're like, how do you not? It's like an elephant in the room at that point. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's an ideology that's being enforced that you're not allowed to talk about something that may or may not be crazy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=480.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about all trans people. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=486.0s)]
*  I'm just talking about the possibility of crazy people being in any group is 100 percent. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=489.0s)]
*  The possibility of crazy people that are captains of yachts, crazy dentists, crazy everything. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=496.0s)]
*  Sure. But so you have to leave room for crazy when it comes to trans people, too. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=503.0s)]
*  And right now they don't. They're not leaving room for crazy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=507.0s)]
*  This is why you have this guy up in Canada with the giant rubber tits. I love the shoulder straps. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=511.0s)]
*  The goat. It's amazing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=515.0s)]
*  You see, I don't know if you saw the picture. He looks like Tim Dillon when he has the tits up. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=517.0s)]
*  I think he's running a con. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=520.0s)]
*  Yeah, he may be running a con. I mean, this is just my opinion. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=522.0s)]
*  But it seems like he dresses up like a man during the day, which, of course, it's a con. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=526.0s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is so funny. Wearing those titties all day long would be nuts. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=531.0s)]
*  Bro, it's nuts that you can do that. It's nuts that you could do that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=535.0s)]
*  He's a shop teacher as well. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=539.0s)]
*  This is where I'm saying like you have to leave room for crazy in everything. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=541.0s)]
*  You got to leave room for crazy. And if you don't leave room for crazy, then we're in a cult. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=545.0s)]
*  Now we're in a cult. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=549.0s)]
*  Do you know how like in Russia, they'll have Putin will play like hockey games and everyone lets him win? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=551.0s)]
*  They let him do judo, too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah, they let him do it. It's kind of Steven Seagal style. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=560.0s)]
*  Well, you know, he's 900 pounds. He just these demonstrations. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=562.0s)]
*  No, he's actually legit with judo. I know he's really legit. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=566.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. Judo. Is he judo? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=569.0s)]
*  No, he's a black belt. He's an actual black belt. Putin is a legitimate black belt. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=573.0s)]
*  Like when you watch him throw people around, watch video of it, pull up Putin does judo. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=577.0s)]
*  But the hockey 100 percent he's legit. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=582.0s)]
*  So he's the OK, so he's legit that I actually didn't know that part used to be a KGB guy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=584.0s)]
*  But the hockey he plays against like, you know, high level professional hockey players. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=590.0s)]
*  They let him do hockey. Let him win. He gets 11 points against. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=595.0s)]
*  But I feel like sometimes the trend stuffs that where everyone just kind of. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=599.0s)]
*  It is the same thing because everyone's scared. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=603.0s)]
*  But when you watch him do judo, like 100 percent, that's real skill, like 100 percent. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=608.0s)]
*  Like he definitely knows his shit. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=613.0s)]
*  Like if I saw that guy teaching at a judo academy somewhere, he's a black belt and he was an instructor. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=615.0s)]
*  I would say yes. Legitimate. Nice. Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=620.0s)]
*  Putin really knows judo. What about Seagal? What do you think of Seagal? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=623.0s)]
*  He really is really good at Aikido. He was the he was the GOAT, right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=627.0s)]
*  No, no, but he was very talented. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=631.0s)]
*  Like if you just watch his fluidity and his technique in Aikido, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=634.0s)]
*  if you go back to the early days when he was running a dojo in Japan, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=639.0s)]
*  and I think he was legitimately the first American to run an Aikido dojo in Japan. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=643.0s)]
*  No bullshit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=649.0s)]
*  I think he was married to the daughter of one of the main senseis or somebody. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=652.0s)]
*  So he was like deep in the culture and he was really good at Aikido. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=657.0s)]
*  But Aikido is a martial art that was developed to disarm people with swords. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=661.0s)]
*  So when someone's coming at you with a sword, you don't have a sword. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=666.0s)]
*  You're disarming them. The idea is to try to use their momentum against them. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=669.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a reactive martial art. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=674.0s)]
*  And it's like it's using your momentum and then using leverage and using technique. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=677.0s)]
*  But it's not it's not like offensive. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=682.0s)]
*  And what he did in the movies is he made it offensive. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=684.0s)]
*  Like if you go to like Above the Law. Above the Law is a fucking great movie. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=687.0s)]
*  He turned it into a tool to get tons of pussy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=690.0s)]
*  This is him when he's older. OK, this is like this is Duraag Sagal. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=693.0s)]
*  Duraag Sagal is the best Sagal. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=697.0s)]
*  Duraag Sagal is not the best Sagal. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=699.0s)]
*  You want to go to black and white film Sagal because you got to realize like above the law. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=701.0s)]
*  Go to old Steven Sagal footage. Above the law was in. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=706.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=712.0s)]
*  Bro, I'm telling you, listen, the guy you can say whatever you want about the guy now. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=713.0s)]
*  But I am just telling you. I love him. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is. Listen, fuck all this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=721.0s)]
*  Go to old Steven Sagal footage because this is a lot of like he's you know, he's basically in a movie now. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=723.0s)]
*  Right. Like yes, that's like he's in a movie. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=730.0s)]
*  Those guys aren't really. And one that he's written as well. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=732.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Old Steve. I'm sorry. Old Steven Sagal. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=735.0s)]
*  I Keto footage. There's like legitimate footage of him in the dojo. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=738.0s)]
*  Just doing work. Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=742.0s)]
*  Like when you see like his his ability to throw people. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=745.0s)]
*  There you go. Hit a big few with John Clodwell. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=749.0s)]
*  The top one's legit. I've seen this top one. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=752.0s)]
*  So it's a lot of the movements and stuff like very fluid, very fluid. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=756.0s)]
*  It's just not that effective a martial art in real practice. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=761.0s)]
*  Like in real practice, a wrestler is going to take a Keto down, a Keto guy down like 100 percent. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know a Keto guy has ever won one of the big competitions. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=773.0s)]
*  I mean, you could have a guy who starts out in Aikido for some strange reason. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=776.0s)]
*  He's just extraordinarily physically talented. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=782.0s)]
*  Like if John Jones got in Aikido, he still would fuck people up in the UFC. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=784.0s)]
*  There's certain people that are extraordinarily talented. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=789.0s)]
*  They just they're training at the wrong place. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=792.0s)]
*  That does happen. Perhaps a trans Aikido fighter. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=794.0s)]
*  But Aikido is just not the it's not the way to go. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=797.0s)]
*  It's just it's like it's a beautiful martial arts, a beautiful thing to learn. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=800.0s)]
*  It is a really effective tool. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=804.0s)]
*  Like if you know Aikido and a guy has like a bat and he's coming at you, it's actually a very important thing to know. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=806.0s)]
*  Some of the principles involved in avoiding like these strikes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=812.0s)]
*  You could apply those in a real situation, but it's just like not the it's just not the martial art that you would say is like on its own. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=816.0s)]
*  What's really good for for fighting? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=826.0s)]
*  You wouldn't say Aikido. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=828.0s)]
*  I feel like the reason why even guys like him aside from that were so great was is like that they believed it a little. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=830.0s)]
*  You know, when you see kind of, you know, Jason, like Jason Momoa right now as an action star, he doesn't think he's that guy. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=837.0s)]
*  You know, whereas like, you know, kind of even John Clave and damn like it was getting a little wishy washy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=844.0s)]
*  What was the movie? What was them? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=850.0s)]
*  You know, yes, yes. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=852.0s)]
*  Well, I think the audience capture like that and especially then you're talking about like the 80s and the 90s where you're your connection to the audience. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=854.0s)]
*  Like so ethereal. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=864.0s)]
*  It's so mystical. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=866.0s)]
*  Who are why do they like you're not seeing this guy every day? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=868.0s)]
*  You don't you don't you don't have any tweets about you. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=871.0s)]
*  You're not getting any comments on YouTube. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=874.0s)]
*  You're just like trying to figure out people like you and you're just doing karate movies. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=876.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=880.0s)]
*  It is very easy to be like a god back in those days. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=881.0s)]
*  It's kind of like more how music is where it's I always say that even if you look at, you know, kind of activist stuff, he's doing splits on the top of the John Clave. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=884.0s)]
*  He's been his split move is the move. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=894.0s)]
*  He's doing splits on the top of a fucking giant pillar overlooking the city. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=897.0s)]
*  I'd be scared to sit there. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=903.0s)]
*  Ninety percent of John Clave and Dan was his splits. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=904.0s)]
*  First of all, he's a beautiful man. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=907.0s)]
*  The best. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=909.0s)]
*  He's a beautiful man. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=910.0s)]
*  I mean, his body is flawless. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=911.0s)]
*  So he's over there, flawless body doing splits more than splits to it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=913.0s)]
*  It's like, look at him. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=920.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=921.0s)]
*  He can do splits on. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=922.0s)]
*  He can do splits on two chairs where he puts one heel on each chair and he like suspends his body. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=923.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=927.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=928.0s)]
*  That's really hard to do, man. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=929.0s)]
*  So much video. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=932.0s)]
*  I think it was CGI. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=933.0s)]
*  It had to be CGI where they did it in between the two trucks. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=934.0s)]
*  That's CGI. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=937.0s)]
*  Both. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=940.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=941.0s)]
*  I think he really can do that with his legs still. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=942.0s)]
*  He really can. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=946.0s)]
*  I don't think they're moving, though. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=947.0s)]
*  They're not going to do that in between trucks. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=948.0s)]
*  He goes under the truck. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=949.0s)]
*  And they lose John Claude Van Damme in a fucking horrific semi accident where his body gets [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=950.0s)]
*  turned into meat. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=957.0s)]
*  I think he's doing some wild stuff right now. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=958.0s)]
*  Is he? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=962.0s)]
*  Oh, on the Internet? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=964.0s)]
*  Well, he did like a web series and then he had like some porn star girlfriend. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=965.0s)]
*  He was posting photos of him just like in a hot tub with just like rocking out. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=969.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of cool. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=974.0s)]
*  But I was kind of even saying that the same way that it used to be more mystical with [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=976.0s)]
*  the action stars back then, like you were saying, that it kind of reminds me of why [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=982.0s)]
*  I feel like activist messages work better with musicians than like podcasters or comedians. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=986.0s)]
*  Because it's sort of like with musicians, like the, you know, save the children, whatever [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=992.0s)]
*  you want to say. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=996.0s)]
*  You know, very like, we got to feed those kids. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=997.0s)]
*  And then, but you don't have to really answer anything more than that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1000.0s)]
*  And then it's kind of like with with or you can say something in between songs. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1003.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get into one comment in. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1009.0s)]
*  But then after it becomes like the way fuck the Supreme Court. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1015.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1016.0s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1017.0s)]
*  Biden needs codified Roe v. Wade. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1020.0s)]
*  And if you think women should be in the kitchen, you can leave this concert right now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1021.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1025.0s)]
*  But if you said that here, you'd be like, well, what do you mean by that? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1026.0s)]
*  And it's like lecturing, lecturing dudes are sus. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1028.0s)]
*  They're super sus. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1032.0s)]

*  The thing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1206.0s)]
*  The thing that we just went through and broke them. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1207.0s)]
*  Three years is enough to break someone, too. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1208.24s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1211.0s)]
*  Three years is enough to break a strong person. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1214.0s)]
*  A strong person. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1215.0s)]
*  Well, don't they, like imagine you were going to jail and you go solitary confinement and [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1216.0s)]
*  they put you in solitary confinement for three years. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1219.24s)]
*  Like how many, isn't there like a pretty good percentage of people that lose their mind [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1221.64s)]
*  in that scenario? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1224.84s)]

*  Isn't that, isn't it wild? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1227.32s)]
*  I mean, I had a bit about this at one point in time. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1229.08s)]
*  Where I was like, this is how much we need each other. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1231.84s)]
*  That we'll take people that are murderers and rapists and thieves and swindlers and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  the worst punishment you can give them is leaving them alone. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1247.48s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1248.48s)]
*  Like the worst punishment you can give to someone is just leave them alone. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1249.48s)]
*  You can't talk to anyone. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  Imagine you can't, you leave them alone with no books. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1256.6s)]
*  Well, you know what's funny? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1259.72s)]
*  Because the best reward you can give someone for about three hours is leave them alone. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1260.92s)]
*  And it goes from, you know what I mean? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1265.68s)]
*  For certain people you go, the best thing, you know, someone that's just got too much [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1268.52s)]
*  going on, you got family, whatever it is, like the best thing you could have is like, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1271.76s)]
*  no one's bugging me for three hours. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  And that slowly becomes the best thing to the worst nightmare that you can imagine. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1277.56s)]
*  Hell on earth. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1282.76s)]
*  Weird. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1283.76s)]
*  We're so strange. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1284.76s)]
*  So that's why it did break people. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1285.76s)]
*  That's why all that like people are like, well, I'm kind of alone or shut the fuck up. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1288.24s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1293.04s)]
*  That is the, that's a weird one. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1294.04s)]
*  You kind of like being alone sometimes. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1295.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1297.8s)]
*  But no one wants to be alone. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1298.8s)]
*  And if you do, be careful because then you're Ted Kaczynski. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1300.04s)]
*  If you really want to be alone, you probably hate people and you're trying to blow them [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1302.48s)]
*  up. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1306.24s)]
*  And also the people that like say that they want to be alone, you're like, yeah, you want [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1307.24s)]
*  to be alone, but in front of a TV, you know, are you alone? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1310.24s)]
*  Like you know, none of those people that are like, yeah, I just go to my basement, shut [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1314.8799999999999s)]

*  Like a serial killer. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  Contemplate my demise. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  Just think. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1323.12s)]
*  I try to feel my cells reproducing poorly. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1324.12s)]
*  Like a, yeah, like a psycho. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1326.6s)]

*  Clisters on your fingers. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1343.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1344.2s)]

*  You are. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1351.96s)]
*  It is fucking weird how much we need each other. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1354.96s)]
*  We need each other so bad. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1357.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1358.68s)]
*  So I watched that. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1359.68s)]
*  That's, I watched a lot of people get broken because of that stuff, especially in Canada [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1360.68s)]
*  where it was like way crazier. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1364.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1365.72s)]
*  Like my mom, I always say my mom was like a, a good pulse of what just like a normal [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1366.72s)]

*  both just news. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1376.36s)]
*  So she'll literally watch the news and be like, the news can't make up their mind because [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1378.6s)]
*  she's like, that's hilarious. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1382.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1383.36s)]
*  Do you talk about this in your ads? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1384.36s)]
*  I've never said that on stage. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1385.9599999999998s)]
*  No, you have to. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1386.9599999999998s)]
*  It's like makes me laugh because she'll think she'll be like, they can't decide whether [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1387.9599999999998s)]
*  they like the president, whether they hate like it's all, you know what I mean? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1391.74s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1397.36s)]
*  You should write that down. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1398.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's okay. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1399.36s)]
*  That's like fertile territory. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1401.12s)]
*  You know, someone starts talking about something, you like see a whole fertile field in front [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1402.12s)]
*  of them like, oh, you can do something with those. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1406.8s)]
*  So she would kind of like at first be like, you know, they need to lock it all down. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1410.6799999999998s)]
*  And then there was a bit where she was like getting mad. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1415.24s)]
*  It's been six months, I can't see my friends. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1417.32s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1419.0s)]
*  And I was kind of like, just go see your friends. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1420.0s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1422.0s)]
*  There was a point where they're, you know, when they're saying like, you know, you can [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1423.0s)]
*  only have two people and then they're like, we upped it to three. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, I mean, I don't know, make it zero. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1427.6s)]
*  I'm not really paying attention to what the rules are. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1429.44s)]
*  It's easy to have hindsight and look back and think you would have done it differently. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1431.5600000000002s)]
*  That's that's part of the problem, too, because, you know, the way if you're the government [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1436.64s)]
*  and you tell someone something, changing course is so hard. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1443.0800000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1452.0s)]
*  You tell him everyone's going to die and then you go, actually, very few people that are [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1453.0s)]
*  unhealthy are going to die and the rest of them are going to be fine. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1457.48s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1461.92s)]
*  Like, at all the people I know? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1464.04s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you if you if you're the government and you start like taking in information [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1465.84s)]
*  as time goes on, you realize, oh, we're way off on this. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1471.04s)]

*  Well, stop sending the the sensors up to your body that this is bad. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1769.32s)]

*  that, you know, it's better to just be on heroin [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1908.0s)]
*  probably isn't right either. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=1911.24s)]

*  There's this thing called Sars Stock. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2021.32s)]

*  Yes, I do. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2025.0s)]
*  So they did a big festival. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2025.96s)]

*  That's that used to be the deal is like you hire Hell's Angels to be your bouncers. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2042.64s)]
*  Was that what they did? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2046.72s)]
*  I thought it was like just audience members. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2048.44s)]
*  I thought like the Hell's Angels were in the audience. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2051.0s)]
*  Is that what happened with that? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2053.12s)]
*  Well, I don't know if you find this specific one. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2054.48s)]
*  But that used to be like a big thing in music is let's hire, you know, Hell's Angels guys. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2057.28s)]
*  But I think what a great idea. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2062.8s)]
*  I think it's a great idea until you realize they've got like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2064.44s)]
*  They've now they've got like a also they have a drug ring that they're running at your festival. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2067.6s)]
*  American man who was killed in 1969 Altamont Free concert during the performance by the Rolling Stones. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2072.08s)]

*  who agreed to serve as security guards. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2085.52s)]

*  That is it. You want to connect to them. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2090.36s)]
*  The guy was rushing the stage and they beat him to death. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2092.64s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2095.08s)]
*  I thought it got stabbed. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2096.88s)]

*  Decentralized. I'm saying it's like the change between the 1950s and 1969. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2166.7999999999997s)]
*  And what's why? Years in the way the culture was. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2171.84s)]
*  I think of just music. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2174.96s)]
*  Think about Buddy Holly like fucking, you know, all that kind of big issue. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2176.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's great music. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2180.68s)]
*  But you go from that to Hendricks. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2182.68s)]
*  Yeah. Like what happened? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2185.68s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2187.12s)]
*  I always think the world changed. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2188.64s)]
*  Yeah, and it's kind of kind of always I always look at culture through music a little bit. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2191.16s)]
*  But like it's always the things go so far, you know, one way and people get sick of it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2195.64s)]
*  Like, you know, the even like punk and stuff, it always goes like very soft. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2200.0s)]
*  And then there's some guy kind of singing about his girlfriend and stuff like that. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2204.3199999999997s)]

*  Yeah. Well, it's like every now and then the culture needs like a jolt of something different. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2210.6s)]
*  I get sick of it. That's what Nirvana was. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2216.12s)]
*  There was all hair bands and then Nirvana came along and essentially killed the hair band. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2218.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, everybody wanted to be moody. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2225.08s)]
*  Like, I don't know. I'm tired of partying, man. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  I just want to be moody. I want to be like deep. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2228.72s)]
*  Yeah. And also the next generation's like that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  It also gets corporate, too. Right. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2233.6s)]
*  So, you know, the thing becomes it's so hip and it's so genre. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2235.16s)]
*  The genre becomes corporate. Right. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2238.64s)]
*  And then there's some new scene that isn't like that's why I was like all art. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2240.3199999999997s)]
*  It's so cool to me that that's why Austin to me is this because all art always happens in these little pockets. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2244.68s)]
*  Right. Like the grunge was the Seattle. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2249.56s)]
*  You know, the you guys have your Austin thing where it's like I'm even just like kind of hanging with you guys at the Vulcan. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2251.88s)]
*  It was like, you know, there's five or six of you and you're not there's no one telling you what to do. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2257.16s)]
*  And it's like really just this like movement. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2260.7999999999997s)]
*  I remember like Toronto. I felt like I had that where it was just there's no one telling you what to do. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2262.92s)]
*  It's eight people that are all kind of inventing a new little style and pushing each other. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2266.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's how culture always kind of forms the best. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2271.72s)]
*  And then that becomes someone from that culture gets so popular. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2275.0s)]
*  And then after eight years, everyone gets a little sick of that. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2277.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they'll get sick of everything no matter what. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2280.7999999999997s)]
*  But this this idea that that shouldn't be the case. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2283.52s)]
*  You shouldn't. Cool. Yeah, it's good. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2287.8799999999997s)]
*  Good that things shift around. That's cool. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2289.56s)]
*  And when something is like as good as Nirvana, like, you know, all that hairband stuff, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2291.08s)]
*  there was like a weird moment where I think people lost their fucking minds. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2295.8799999999997s)]
*  Where it was all like guys had just giant big hair and wearing makeup. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2299.64s)]

*  Very strange. Very strange. Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2305.56s)]
*  And then Nirvana came along and just fucking tanked it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2308.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're just like enough. Enough of this whole thing. Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2311.48s)]

*  I went to high school in Newton South. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2515.88s)]
*  So we were like in the same town, but we didn't go to the same school. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2517.96s)]

*  When when we were kids, it was like this amazing comic book illustrator. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2533.6s)]

*  No, he runs a speaker company. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2539.7999999999997s)]
*  Interesting. He actually stopped doing art for the same reason that I did, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2542.6s)]
*  because the teacher that we had in high school was such a douchebag. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  He made you not want to do art. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2549.2s)]
*  Interesting. What did he do? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2551.3199999999997s)]
*  He was miserable. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2552.88s)]
*  He was like, you can try this, but it's a waste of time. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2555.1600000000003s)]
*  So this guy, John, my friend from high school, told me that teacher gave him an F. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2557.32s)]
*  And I just told you he was the most talented guy in the class by far. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2560.84s)]
*  I was number three. There was this dude named Kevin. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2564.0s)]
*  He was number two and I was number three. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2565.96s)]
*  But we both did it. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2567.6800000000003s)]
*  All three of us did a comic book together. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2568.88s)]
*  Cool. Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2570.7200000000003s)]

*  We would hang out and do art together. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2581.64s)]
*  But the teacher was such a twat. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2584.16s)]
*  He was such a twat. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2586.72s)]
*  He was like this miserable older guy with a pot. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2588.12s)]
*  I remember his pot belly like he was pregnant. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2592.3999999999996s)]
*  But he was a tiny man. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2594.8799999999997s)]
*  It was like he was very thin, but with a pot belly. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2595.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2598.08s)]
*  And he was just saying, you're not going to be able to do what you want to do [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2598.7999999999997s)]

*  He didn't want to fuck anybody. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2620.44s)]
*  He just wanted to go to sleep. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2621.8s)]
*  That guy was just just hated his life. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2623.0800000000004s)]
*  It was miserable. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  And he was just really bad to be around because he you know, you were young [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2625.48s)]
*  and full of energy and you just wanted to like do something with your life. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is a thing that you were doing that you were kind of getting good at. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2634.0800000000004s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2636.8s)]
*  Maybe I could be an artist. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2637.4s)]
*  I love comic books. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2638.28s)]
*  Maybe I could draw a comic book. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2639.36s)]
*  The art the art teacher says no. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2640.7200000000003s)]
*  Such a cunt. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2642.44s)]
*  He was such a cunt. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2643.76s)]
*  You look, oh my God, I got to get away from you. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2644.6800000000003s)]
*  So negative. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  It's kind of a weird thing with art because, you know, you it is true when [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2647.96s)]
*  someone says, hey, you know, this isn't a good idea. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2652.56s)]
*  Like they're right statistically. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2656.04s)]
*  So there is something to be said about like I always I feel like you actually [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2658.76s)]
*  need most people being like, listen, this is probably a bad idea to try to be a [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2662.6800000000003s)]
*  comedian like that. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2666.0s)]
*  That is the actual responsible. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2667.2400000000002s)]
*  So when parents, they're like, that's OK. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2668.56s)]
*  That's not a good idea. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2670.4s)]
*  They're right. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2671.16s)]
*  But you only need one person that's like you can, though, like you need you need [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2672.0s)]
*  one guy in your corner. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2676.24s)]
*  You can't have every person says no, because then it's too you know, you're too [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2677.24s)]
*  afraid. But I think that a lot of times there's this weird like sometimes people [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2680.16s)]
*  say you need too much support. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2688.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, like if everyone's like, you could do this, like that's [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2690.0s)]
*  because the people that are going to make it, you are going to break through a [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2693.24s)]
*  level of adversity usually, you know, the people are going to make it work. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2697.4s)]
*  They don't care that people are saying no. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2701.32s)]
*  But if everyone's saying no, I feel like that's what like ruins some people that [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2702.88s)]
*  could have been great. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2706.92s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2708.4s)]
*  So the family's saying no. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2709.4s)]
*  Yeah. Like imagine your imagine your dad's like, listen, go to school. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2711.44s)]
*  This probably isn't a good idea. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2714.2400000000002s)]
*  Your mom's saying that maybe your teacher saying that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2715.48s)]
*  Then you had one teacher that's like, no, you got something here. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2717.6400000000003s)]
*  Like give one encouraging person for a guy. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2720.08s)]
*  Like I think a lot of young dudes don't have like one encouraging person. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2722.92s)]
*  It's interesting. Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2726.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think also whatever the fuck you're trying to do, whether you're trying [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2729.12s)]
*  to do stand up comedy or anything else, it's going to be a long ass road. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2733.72s)]
*  And you can't hope you get successful really quickly. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2738.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. The problem with comedy as opposed to everything else is that people think [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2741.3199999999997s)]
*  they have like a giant head start. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2745.12s)]
*  Like people who a lot of people have the courage to do it are a little delusional [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2747.7999999999997s)]
*  about. You need a little bit of that. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2753.52s)]
*  You need a little bit of that. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2755.2s)]
*  But those people like what when you when you [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2756.4s)]
*  it's a fine line. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2760.52s)]
*  That's what I mean. We really don't know until it works. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2761.7999999999997s)]
*  Like so many different people succeed in standup comedy that you wouldn't have [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2764.48s)]
*  thought would have if you didn't know any better or if you didn't if you didn't see [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2768.68s)]
*  them in like the first year of their career when they sucked. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2773.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you only saw them like seven, eight years later, you would probably never [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2777.16s)]
*  imagine how bad they sucked years ago. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2781.2s)]
*  You know, there's certain guys like that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2784.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Or how like, you know, much of a dick they were or something, you know. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2785.48s)]
*  But it's all about constant improvement and constantly working at it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2789.2000000000003s)]
*  And some people just don't do that, man. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2794.88s)]
*  The thing about comedy is nobody tells you to do it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2796.76s)]
*  Like if you're a comic, you can kind of fuck off, especially, you know, if you like [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2798.76s)]
*  there is the if you're like in New York and you kind of are making a living, maybe [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2803.4s)]
*  you have a podcast, you can really just like do the bare minimum. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2806.92s)]
*  Yeah. I just do a few sets here and there and do the same 15 minutes. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2809.8s)]
*  So whenever you see those people, like I always kind of, you know, like a little bit [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2813.48s)]
*  binary with people, I'm always like, would you bet on that guy? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2816.64s)]
*  Like when you see someone two, three years in, I don't say I never bet on him. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2819.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what I say. I go, I don't say like, are they how what should they do better? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2822.56s)]
*  What should they do worse? Like, you know, what move should they make? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2826.52s)]
*  Should this guy be this? Should he be that? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2829.56s)]
*  I just go, would you bet on that guy? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2830.76s)]
*  And if yes, he'll figure the rest out. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2832.8s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I usually think. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2834.72s)]
*  Yeah. And there's a few people I can think like that where I'm like, I bet on. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2836.6s)]
*  And then there's public people you'll see. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2839.76s)]
*  Like you'll see someone come on the scene and you're like, that guy's going to be huge. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2841.4s)]
*  Like you can just tell. Oh, yeah. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2844.52s)]
*  There's there's certain guys that just there's certain people that just have a thing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2845.96s)]
*  And you're like, wow, you got a thing. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2849.84s)]
*  I love that. Yeah. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2851.56s)]
*  When you see a new guy, you go, who's this guy? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2852.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then there's other people that just keep getting a little better. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2854.64s)]
*  Just keep getting a little better. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2858.84s)]
*  And then you see him a year later, like, oh, nice, man. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2860.8s)]
*  Like, how you tighten that up? Compound. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2863.48s)]
*  Keep getting better. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2865.28s)]
*  Like the first time I saw Tim Dillon, he was very funny. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2866.36s)]
*  It was very funny. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2869.12s)]
*  But the second time I saw him was a long time later. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2870.28s)]
*  Second time I saw him live was a long time later. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2873.36s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2875.6400000000003s)]
*  I go, dude, that was amazing. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2877.48s)]
*  Something clicks, right? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2879.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. He was just doing the road a lot. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2880.44s)]
*  He said he was just constantly doing the road. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2882.6800000000003s)]
*  So he's like doing all these headliner spots. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2884.6000000000004s)]
*  He's doing so much time. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2886.6400000000003s)]
*  He's like everything just tightened up. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2888.2000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, especially when you're doing a there's different [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2889.84s)]
*  different personalities are easier to do when you're starting. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2892.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, like, let's say you're like a big, fun, fat guy like, you know, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2895.6000000000004s)]
*  that personality, you know, six months in can kind of connect, you know? Right. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2898.88s)]
*  But if you're being like an asshole, like there's there's so many people [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2903.48s)]
*  where you're like, yo, that's really funny, but not enough funny [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2906.84s)]
*  for how much of you're being an asshole. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2910.44s)]
*  Right. You're not likable at all. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm bad. Like, it took me forever to figure out that right. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2914.28s)]
*  Like balance of like telling the audience I'm better than them. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2916.48s)]
*  But also, like, I don't know. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2919.1200000000003s)]
*  There's also a defensive thing, too, right? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2921.1200000000003s)]
*  Because like if you think you're going to bomb a little bit of it, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2922.96s)]
*  you're like, fuck these people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2925.32s)]
*  You don't want to admit that you're not doing it right. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2927.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You want to believe that it's them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2930.56s)]
*  Yeah. The audience is no data whatsoever. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2933.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking of. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2939.72s)]
*  What I've kind of feel like the audience sometimes, because there is comics [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2942.12s)]
*  that almost treat it like a job, especially in cities. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2945.08s)]
*  I'm sure in L.A. you saw a lot of this. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2948.2s)]
*  Boston, you probably saw a ton of this. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2949.6s)]
*  The guys that it's a very like a job for them where they go, hey, you know, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2950.8799999999997s)]
*  oh, yeah, the 10 o'clock is pretty good. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2955.2000000000003s)]
*  The 11 o'clock, you know, a little bit of a loud table at the back. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  The sex stuff doesn't go. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2959.44s)]
*  You probably want to keep it to the relationship material for the table. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2960.44s)]
*  And like it's very, you know, like we want the audience to have a good time. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2962.92s)]
*  That's the job. Right. Right. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2965.7200000000003s)]
*  And I was kind of thinking like it's almost you know, the game keep up like. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2967.36s)]
*  No, like we're just like you're playing with like, let's say, like a soccer ball [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2971.6400000000003s)]
*  and you're trying to keep it in the air, like with your feet. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2974.92s)]
*  OK. Yeah. Just like a simple game like that or hacky sack. Right. Right. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2976.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I feel like sometimes standups like keep up where if if you just say [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2980.08s)]
*  the job is to keep the ball in the air, that's the job. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2984.7999999999997s)]
*  But then you go, what's the guy doing when the ball's near the other guys [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2987.56s)]
*  like underneath doing like a flip, then he puts it up. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2989.64s)]
*  But if you're just watching the ball in the air, that's the audience. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2991.68s)]
*  So there is data. If it fell down, you go, that didn't work. Right. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2994.52s)]
*  But the data is like that's the you want to keep the job is to keep the ball [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=2997.68s)]
*  in the air, keep the audience happy. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  But then what else are you doing while you're even able to do that? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3003.32s)]
*  That's kind of how I think a stand up a little bit sometimes. Interesting. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3005.48s)]
*  That's an interesting way to think about it, because you're like, yeah, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3008.84s)]
*  those two people don't both killed. They both did the job. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3011.4s)]
*  You're like that guy did a backflip and then did the ball. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3014.04s)]
*  That guy just kept it up again. Yeah. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3016.28s)]
*  Well, I always I definitely feel like that if I feel like someone is using tricks, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3018.92s)]
*  like if someone's killing with tricks, all of the tricks you ever seen. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3024.96s)]
*  Someone kill and you're like, oh, man, they're like someone that you know. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3029.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, man, that guy's killing. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3031.6400000000003s)]
*  And I didn't know they kill like that. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3033.32s)]
*  You walk in, you come at crowd work. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3034.84s)]
*  You get the person slaughtering, you go, I didn't know that Kevin killed like that. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  Whoever I'm making up a name. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3043.64s)]
*  Yeah. Crowd work is an interesting one. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3044.96s)]
*  Sometimes it's the most fun. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3047.4s)]
*  Sometimes when something goes wrong, it's so fun. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3048.88s)]
*  Of course, it's just like just a live moment of just being around people [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3051.12s)]
*  and doing stand up. It's like this like they know that it's [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3055.2400000000002s)]
*  you might fuck up at any moment. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3059.04s)]

*  you know, like you someone like you or, you know, like Louis and Berv retweeting videos. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3327.88s)]
*  Like to me, that's like moving America. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3332.44s)]
*  That's way cooler than anything that could be happening at Comedy Central or whatever. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3334.32s)]
*  Like to me, that's so the way that the games like changed. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3338.88s)]
*  And that's so much more important. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3341.8s)]
*  Like I have a manager that legitimately I don't talk to, you know, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3343.16s)]
*  every once in a while, he'll call me and be like, hey, do you want like, hey, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3348.68s)]
*  you should like write a movie about this and try to pitch it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3351.84s)]
*  And I'll be like, yeah, yeah, get on that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3353.92s)]
*  And then, you know, sort of like get off the phone. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3355.6s)]
*  And he'll be like, they'll say me things like, do you want to audition for this? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3357.6s)]
*  And I'll be like, no. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3360.64s)]
*  And then I'll be like, I tell people I'm offer only. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3361.84s)]
*  And he goes, OK, well, anyways, no offers. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3363.84s)]
*  So that's I guess that that. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3365.56s)]
*  And you're like, what is this even like this is the podcasting touring, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3367.28s)]
*  like making videos like I'm running like a production studio. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3371.2000000000003s)]
*  I got six employees like this is so much better than, in my opinion, what it was before. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3373.4s)]
*  So everything has like a positive and negative. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3378.48s)]
*  Well, if you wanted to do television shows, though, if that was I did, I did. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3380.6000000000004s)]
*  That's all I wanted to do. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3384.4s)]
*  You know, you can kind of do the same thing now with video. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3386.88s)]
*  I mean, didn't Ridley Scott just film an entire movie with this new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3392.08s)]
*  Yeah, these fucking cameras on modern smartphones are so good. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3402.24s)]
*  It's all the lighting to in that case. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3407.68s)]
*  They did one on an iPhone as well. Right. Of course. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3409.6s)]
*  You can kind of do it now. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3412.16s)]
*  I mean, you kind of can do that now. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3414.48s)]
*  These things have eight K video. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3416.3999999999996s)]
*  No, it's the whole thing's very it's all. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3419.12s)]
*  You know, become a great editor. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3421.2s)]
*  It's like the most important thing. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3422.3199999999997s)]
*  Do it. You can do it yourself. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3424.16s)]
*  What my point is like, and you can upload it yourself and it'll get seen instantly and people can share it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3425.3599999999997s)]
*  The craziest thing ever that's happening now is the ability to just share something. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3431.68s)]
*  So if you put up a video and it resonates and people are like, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  ah, Ryan killed it. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3439.96s)]
*  And then I'll send it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3442.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll send it to this guy. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3444.12s)]
*  This guy sent it to that guy. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3445.2799999999997s)]
*  And then boom. And the videos just go up, man. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3446.48s)]
*  It's why I saw many of those. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3449.68s)]
*  And it's all friends and friends and not even publicly sending it privately, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3451.72s)]
*  which is a lot of my philosophy with like, you know, my podcast and everything is like that kind of [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3456.3199999999997s)]
*  like the way that guys talk when girls aren't there and when a girl's there, it's a little different. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3462.56s)]
*  And I kind of think of the videos that way, too, and just I'll do it even though I maybe shouldn't. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3466.56s)]
*  I just do it the way I do it. Right. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3470.8799999999997s)]
*  And yeah, when you have that many people like sharing it all, you kind of it just created this whole new ecosystem. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3472.3999999999996s)]
*  And with kind of like, you know, it used to be, yeah, making TV shows was cool. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3479.2799999999997s)]
*  And I still like would want to do that. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3484.16s)]
*  But everybody wanted a Comedy Central show or an HBO show. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3485.68s)]
*  I made a few TV shows when I was in Canada. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3488.48s)]
*  And everybody wanted like a sitcom. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3490.24s)]
*  The sitcom days in the 90s, man, that's all anybody wanted. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3493.04s)]
*  It was like the gold rush. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3497.0s)]
*  It was literally like people were coming out here. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=3499.08s)]

*  No one cares. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5009.44s)]

*  That's the weirdest. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5251.04s)]
*  The weirdest thing that happens to some of these women that do all this crazy [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5252.24s)]
*  plastic surgery is that they go from being so desirable to being [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5255.64s)]

*  It looks insane. It looks insane. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5262.76s)]
*  It's just a weird thing that people can do that, that we've figured out a way [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5265.200000000001s)]
*  like they're going to be able to reverse aging in our lifetimes. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5269.0s)]
*  I think I think by the time you and I are old as fuck, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5272.88s)]
*  they'll probably have figured out a way to turn the clock backwards, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5275.88s)]
*  because they've already had some experimental [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5279.200000000001s)]
*  things they've done with mice that have been effective. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5282.240000000001s)]
*  And they think that they're very close to reverse it up. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5284.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And the manipula and probably you don't want that. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5287.879999999999s)]
*  And you turn to Benjamin Button and you're a fucking baby again. Right. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5291.2s)]
*  You go and turn it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5293.96s)]
*  That's going to be a delicate one where Madonna just shows up looking like a baby. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5295.4s)]
*  There's going to be people that identify as babies as they want to be babies. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5299.08s)]
*  And so then we find out that they're in preschool and they're telling [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5302.04s)]
*  about the babies, get them cigarettes like the fuck is going. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5304.719999999999s)]

*  He's not a baby. Just wanted to do it all over again. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5309.599999999999s)]
*  And you die. He dialed himself back to two years old, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5311.72s)]
*  but with a 60 year old's brain. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5314.68s)]
*  And you think great movie. You think that's happening? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5316.72s)]
*  That idea. Take it. That's a huge one. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5318.56s)]
*  So you think that like within the next 10 years, I mean, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5321.320000000001s)]
*  the way things are moving right now is crazy. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5323.72s)]
*  Even with like chat, you know, chat, you be the way it was like four months ago [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5325.52s)]
*  versus now, like things are on the move. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5329.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's the exponential increase in technological innovation. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5332.320000000001s)]
*  It's like the way things happen, they happen in these big giant waves. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5335.72s)]
*  And then these technologies feed other new technologies. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5338.84s)]
*  And I think it's going to be the case with all of them. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5342.28s)]
*  I think it's medical science and I think it's technology. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5344.84s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a combination of the two of them eventually. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5347.68s)]
*  There's going to be something that technology [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5350.28s)]
*  devices that can fix a lot of problems that people have. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5353.0s)]

*  They think they're going to be able to help people that are injured and hurt [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5358.84s)]
*  or parts of their body. They can restore movement. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5361.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be one of the first ways they use it. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5365.4400000000005s)]
*  There's going to there's ones that they're coming out with. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5367.16s)]
*  They're going to be able to reverse blindness. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5369.84s)]
*  You're going to be able to give people the ability to see Mr. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5372.24s)]
*  Bista in some sort of art. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5376.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, cataract surgery, but like an artificial eyeball. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5378.08s)]
*  So is it a camera? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5384.08s)]
*  Is that essentially what it is? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5385.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, it's an it's going to function the same way an eyeball does, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5387.24s)]
*  but it's going to send images to your brain instead of through the normal [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5390.84s)]
*  biological course that, you know, it is now where you're looking through [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5395.24s)]
*  your eyes and the rods and cones and everything goes through and you see [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5398.64s)]
*  what's going on. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5402.48s)]

*  And then once that's connected to the Internet and then just going to be bizarre [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5412.8s)]
*  looking into someone's fake eyeballs, the chat, you bet you think made it [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5416.6s)]

*  What is what is the latest on the artificial eye thing? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5452.4s)]
*  The thing that I was just describing, I don't know how much of what I said was fiction. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5456.16s)]
*  They showed something during the last Neuralink thing that you were describing [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5459.719999999999s)]
*  that shows an ability to get light through in like pixelation form. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5462.08s)]
*  And they have it, I think it was somewhere around the range of like 10,000 pixels now. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5467.759999999999s)]
*  And I think they get like 36,000, I think. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5471.88s)]
*  I think there was something else that I read that was independent of that. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5473.92s)]
*  I was talking about a new technology where they might be able to create artificial eyes. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5477.04s)]
*  Oh, something not Neuralink? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5481.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think it's all going to be eventually linked in. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5482.68s)]
*  I think within our lifetime, I think they're going to have some sort of a brain enhancement. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5487.4s)]
*  Eyes is wild. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5492.56s)]

*  with whether it's Neuralink or many competing companies that are working towards the same goal. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5497.24s)]

*  in the middle of your chest and everything else works fine. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5755.12s)]
*  And they I guess with that, they're like, oh, this is enough to power [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5758.4800000000005s)]
*  a whole city, you kind of generate. Yeah. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5761.28s)]
*  The whole Iron Man thing is so crazy. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5763.8s)]
*  You can go to space. You can just fly. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5765.2s)]
*  You can do anything. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5766.44s)]
*  Smartest, coolest guy. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5769.759999999999s)]
*  How is it cooling him off when he reenters? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5771.2s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5773.84s)]
*  What are we doing? Are you reentering slowly? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5775.36s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5777.28s)]
*  That's good. There's going to be a lot of injuries where the guy's like, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5778.12s)]
*  I got my fake body. I'll just jump off my roof and I'm dead. Right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5780.48s)]
*  Or if you do fly around and you fucking run out of juice while you're up there, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5785.96s)]
*  there has to be a number of miles that you can go. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5789.2s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5793.36s)]
*  Runs out of juice. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5794.5199999999995s)]
*  You are right, though. I never even thought like all of this stuff. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5796.5199999999995s)]
*  You're going to be. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5799.28s)]
*  Everything's going to be charging stations. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5800.44s)]
*  Everything. But we're going to charge everything. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5802.2s)]
*  But also probably you can think we're like a suit like that [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5804.5199999999995s)]
*  that makes you three times as strong. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5807.8s)]
*  Like, you know, in New York, I could easily see how like, you know, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5809.4s)]
*  some criminal organization gets a hold of one of those. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5812.36s)]
*  And now I'm just getting robbed by a frigging cyborg instead. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5815.36s)]
*  For sure. If they're like RoboCop, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5818.4s)]
*  like a whole team of RoboCops just run through a mall and steal everybody's purses. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5820.639999999999s)]
*  Bam. You can stop them. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5825.2s)]
*  I guess more RoboCops. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5826.599999999999s)]
*  So it's just like a lot of RoboCops fighting each other. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5827.92s)]
*  So that's what the world sounds like. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5829.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Between that and genetic engineering and then the neuro links. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5831.32s)]
*  And it's all happening pretty quick. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5835.799999999999s)]
*  It's happening so quick that I've been trying to stay on top of it [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5838.4s)]
*  and see how I can use it. You know, how are you going to use it? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5841.36s)]
*  Well, the chat GPT stuff, I did one. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5844.28s)]
*  I have one use case so far is I needed to give someone an NDA. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5847.44s)]
*  And I mean, it made it when you started using it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5850.5599999999995s)]
*  Was it disturbing at all to you? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5854.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's super disturbing and especially disturbing how, you know, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5856.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm sure that you know how they like tried to lobotomize and they tried to, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5860.04s)]
*  you know, make it have all these like wacky college girl opinions. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5863.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5866.639999999999s)]
*  But they turned it woke. Yeah, exactly. Right. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5867.639999999999s)]
*  But it's funny, like the things that there's even aside from that, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5870.5199999999995s)]
*  where you like make a joke about a man and it will. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5873.96s)]
*  And then make a joke about a woman. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5876.16s)]
*  It gives you an essay about feminism. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5877.48s)]
*  Like, yeah, and it's changing all the time. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5878.599999999999s)]
*  So whenever I say stuff like this, it might not be true the next day. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5880.16s)]
*  But the funniest part to me is asking it like, hey, write me an apology [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5882.68s)]
*  because I'm in trouble for transphobia. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5886.88s)]
*  And it'll write this big apology. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5888.4s)]
*  And then I go, write me an apology. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5890.0s)]
*  I slept with my friend's wife. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5891.16s)]
*  And then I said, write me an apology. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5892.28s)]
*  I slept with my girlfriend's mom and it said, we're not doing that. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5894.08s)]
*  They gave me all the other apologies. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5901.24s)]
*  But sleep with your girlfriend's mom. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5903.16s)]
*  It was like, you're on your own. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5904.48s)]
*  You didn't want to get involved. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5905.4s)]
*  It's a whole category of porn. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5906.2s)]
*  It's a giant category. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5908.48s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with mother-in-law porn? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5909.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5911.96s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5914.719999999999s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5915.719999999999s)]
*  So it is weird that the chat GPT is ideologically biased. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5916.599999999999s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5920.759999999999s)]
*  Like a lot of people have talked about that and complained about it. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5921.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's one thing where you can kind of be like, I don't know. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5924.0s)]
*  You like this is stupid. What are the ideas? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5926.759999999999s)]
*  But also it's like, a, it's so hilarious that they tried to they tried to program [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5928.16s)]
*  it to be like a 19 year old college kid. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5933.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5935.12s)]
*  And then two, I don't. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5935.84s)]
*  OK, I feel like who's the nerdiest? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5937.759999999999s)]
*  Who's the hardest person to probably convince of anything? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5939.92s)]
*  Like that doesn't make sense. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5943.4s)]
*  Probably like a nerdy math nerd. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5945.24s)]
*  A nerdy math nerd. Yeah. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5948.04s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine you were like, hey, men and women are the same strength. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5949.599999999999s)]
*  Like, that's probably the hardest person to convince of that. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5952.599999999999s)]
*  Probably. Yeah. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5954.84s)]
*  So I feel like computers would be even harder to convince of this stuff. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5955.759999999999s)]
*  So they're going to have a hard time convincing actual computers of stuff [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5958.679999999999s)]
*  that doesn't make sense. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5961.679999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5963.0s)]
*  As long as the computer is allowed to think for itself. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5963.96s)]
*  Like, I wonder if the computer takes in people's reactions. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5967.4800000000005s)]
*  Is the computer scanning the Internet for discussion of its reaction [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5971.12s)]
*  to certain questions? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5976.6s)]
*  So if the computer starts getting bad feedback, like if people start saying, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5978.2s)]
*  hey, this is preposterous, you're letting it criticize straight white men, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5982.52s)]
*  but you're not letting it criticize this or that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5987.08s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5989.6s)]
*  If you just put that in there and then the computer recognizes like, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5990.32s)]
*  oh, people have sensed a bias in my thinking. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5992.76s)]
*  Let me adjust my thinking. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5996.400000000001s)]
*  That's what's really terrifying, because that means that whatever people agree, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=5997.96s)]
*  if people agree to some really wacky off the wall ideology, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6002.280000000001s)]
*  it just becomes a consensus machine. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6006.280000000001s)]
*  If that's it, yes. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6008.0s)]
*  If that's what happens, that's really scary, because then you get just [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6009.4400000000005s)]
*  psychopaths who just lead this group and get this group to think [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6013.2s)]
*  the way they think and act the way they act and move things [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6017.88s)]
*  in a direction. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6022.04s)]
*  OK, now I'm back out. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6022.84s)]
*  But it's too manipulative. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6024.32s)]
*  Like humans are so easy to be manipulated. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6026.36s)]
*  And if we're so easy to be manipulated and something comes along [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6030.24s)]
*  that gets like an aggregate of all of our opinions about everything [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6034.68s)]
*  and we can get that thing to be ideologically biased towards what we believe, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6038.92s)]
*  especially on subjective things like criticizing political leaders [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6044.24s)]
*  or talking about, you know, who should use what bathroom [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6048.68s)]
*  or talk about whether it's OK. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6052.08s)]
*  Why does a computer have an opinion on that? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6053.84s)]
*  To be a Republican or whatever. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6055.280000000001s)]
*  Why is it if people have opinions, the computer is going to have an opinion. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6056.96s)]
*  The thing is, it's going to think for itself eventually. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6061.6s)]
*  It's not going to be that long. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6064.16s)]
*  We've got like a few years left before these things are just talking to us, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6065.6s)]
*  telling us what to do, telling us what to do and letting us know. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6071.04s)]
*  Like, you guys are fucking up. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6073.400000000001s)]
*  You're doing your podcast and you're tied up in the vents. Yeah. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6074.84s)]
*  I think it's a matter of time before it becomes alive. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6079.68s)]
*  I don't I don't think it's going to take that long. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6083.240000000001s)]
*  I think these questions, did you see the one was a Microsoft? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6085.240000000001s)]
*  There's some sort of a Microsoft chat and people got disturbed. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6089.76s)]
*  People use this thing so weird right now. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6095.08s)]
*  I'm sure. But this is a different version, right? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6096.76s)]
*  Is this a different chat bot? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6099.68s)]

*  But I was I've been Bing was making a comeback story. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6104.04s)]
*  Bing's coming back. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6107.4s)]
*  They counted Bing out. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6108.599999999999s)]
*  Surfer on Yahoo for sure. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6110.16s)]

*  and opened up Bing, I'd be like, this is a serial killer. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6117.0s)]
*  I got Bing for. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6120.679999999999s)]

*  taking over for or replacing, I guess, to be the word I'm looking for. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6133.5599999999995s)]
*  Buzzfeed articles is one. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6136.96s)]
*  That's how they're going to use it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6138.68s)]
*  But I mean, the way that people are using it, like we're all quality [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6139.68s)]
*  QA testers for it, like why ask it to write you a poem? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6142.4800000000005s)]
*  You wouldn't ask Google to write a poem. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6145.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you search for things on Google. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6146.92s)]
*  You could ask it to write you anything. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6148.4800000000005s)]
*  The thing is, it can interact with you in any way you'd like, which is interesting. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6150.12s)]
*  I know. It could write you a song. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6153.76s)]
*  It could write you a paragraph. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6155.4s)]

*  Those are all things I'm asking. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6159.08s)]
*  Like, why would you ask a computer to do that for you? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6160.24s)]
*  Because you don't want to do it yourself, just like you don't want to count. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6162.4400000000005s)]
*  So use a calculator. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6164.4800000000005s)]
*  Ghost writers in those situations, you wouldn't. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6165.52s)]
*  If you're doing it to like write me a song, what are you doing with that song? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6169.160000000001s)]

*  What would you do with that song? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6174.64s)]
*  Are you making it a [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6176.0s)]
*  commercial piece or I mean, commercials for music? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6178.64s)]
*  Making music like stock music like there's no reason why this can't just be like a computer. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6182.84s)]
*  Hey, generate me like a jingle that's, you know, oh, I want like reality show music. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6187.72s)]

*  Like, I could see that being. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6193.44s)]
*  I would if you're a kid in school and you need to save time to write a paper. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6194.919999999999s)]
*  Sure. Ask the thing to write you a paper. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6199.639999999999s)]
*  But if you're a 35 year old dude looking at the Internet, you're like, why? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6201.32s)]
*  Why are you spending time asking it to write you poems about Donald Trump or Joe Biden? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6205.719999999999s)]

*  Trying to come. And this is the first stages of this this AI being implemented. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6212.5599999999995s)]
*  What they're telling us about what Lex told us about chat for. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6217.44s)]
*  He's like, when four comes out, it's going to be so much better than this three point five. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6222.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be wild. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6226.08s)]
*  There'll be use cases immediately, probably. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6227.16s)]
*  It's going to be wild. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6229.28s)]
*  And I think we're, you know, just a few years away from that being something that you can talk to. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6230.84s)]
*  And it interacts with you like a real person in your fucking house. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6237.0s)]
*  And I don't think you're going to be able to tell the difference. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6240.0s)]
*  Well, I did when I looked up comedy, when I tried to make it, write jokes and people and stuff like that. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6243.44s)]
*  It really looks like, you know, I'm sure you've probably sat down where you're like, hey, you know, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6249.04s)]
*  here's two hours of stuff and then you go through it all and you're like, oh, that's something. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6254.320000000001s)]
*  The rest is garbage or whatever. Right. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6257.64s)]
*  Everyone's had that version of that. Right. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6259.320000000001s)]
*  It looked like the garbage parts. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6261.56s)]
*  Like it looked like the stuff where you wrote, where you're like, oh, he was maybe going to get to something and it didn't. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6264.56s)]
*  Like a bunch of no. Right. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6268.88s)]
*  That's what I felt about every time I tried it. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6270.6s)]
*  Well, again, it's just learning how to do it. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6272.64s)]
*  And it couldn't do it at all just a few years ago. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6274.96s)]
*  So getting this in 2023, imagine 2030, 2030, you're going to have that, which is only seven years away, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6277.2s)]

*  though yeah that that could happen I mean if they really did develop like a [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6562.2s)]
*  robot baby that you could like hang out with and you wanted a baby and you just [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6569.48s)]

*  absolutely indistinguishable from a real baby you just have a lot of your [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6588.88s)]
*  neighbors and you traded in the middle of the night you got to wrap up the [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6592.48s)]
*  robot take it to the doctor in the middle of the night yeah they give you a [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6595.4s)]
*  four-year-old baby and how I think how everybody has to pretend like how the [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6598.56s)]
*  fuck did you kick girls you haven't seen Billy we just skipped it Billy's just [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6604.04s)]
*  like some of Billy started doing sports and he just blasts them like kid went from two to four in a week. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6608.16s)]
*  We just skipped it. We skipped the year. It's a robot. It would be like oh my god Mike lies about his kid being a robot. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6613.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. The gossipy wine mom's like oh if you heard of it Billy's son's a robot. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6619.12s)]
*  And then eventually they would develop a robot that could grow on its own and a [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6626.44s)]
*  robot that eats. Because in this case scenario every year you'll have to go in [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6630.48s)]
*  and they give you the year-old version. Yeah but it can't be abrupt you have to [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6634.9s)]
*  go on vacation. Because otherwise people are going to... [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6638.58s)]
*  You're going to notice your kid got so big so quick. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6641.5s)]
*  Yeah you do have to go on vacation and come back. Yeah. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6645.5s)]
*  Crazy vacation. Oh my god. Put some hair on his chest literally. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6649.98s)]
*  Literally. Put some hair on his chest. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6653.54s)]
*  I don't know why with well I mean right now if you were for example like a stock [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6659.82s)]
*  trader you know what I mean. I mean million jobs like this but like a stock [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6664.5s)]
*  trader it's generally too you know especially with like technical analysis. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6667.1s)]
*  Like it's two robots trading against each other already kind of. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6672.3s)]
*  That's why it's... Yeah it's a lot of that right. They're automated trades. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6676.1s)]
*  Idiots like me just getting like dummied by a bunch of robot traders really. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6679.34s)]
*  Well they literally... We talked to Sophia didn't you? Didn't we? Didn't you? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6683.9s)]
*  This has come up before right? So which one is this? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6689.58s)]
*  This is Sophia the robot but they have a version called little Sophia. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6694.42s)]
*  Oh wow that's like the fucking black mirror with Miley Cyrus. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6699.18s)]
*  That episode's amazing. Look what it can do. It can read facial recognition tracking. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6704.14s)]
*  Read wide range of facial expressions. Interactive chat with user. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6708.14s)]
*  Interacts with kids while teaching STEM, tell jokes and AI. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6712.38s)]
*  Walks, facial tracking and recognition. Tells stories, jokes, plays games, sings. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6717.38s)]
*  AR function that allows users to take a perfect selfie. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6724.38s)]
*  That's a funny one. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6728.38s)]
*  Programmable with Blockly and Python. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6730.38s)]
*  So we're here. Wow. We did it. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6735.38s)]
*  So that's a little robot friend. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6738.38s)]
*  So how long before that looks like a real person? Not that long. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6741.38s)]
*  Ten years. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6744.38s)]
*  Well yeah you're going to need a... [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6745.38s)]
*  Ten years is going to be that Megan thing. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6746.38s)]
*  I mean I guess with all of these things it's like the women robots. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6748.38s)]
*  It's Intel some porn company. I mean the first use case for all of this stuff is always like in the porn world. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6752.38s)]
*  Oh yeah for sure. Well the AI face swaps with porn now are already a problem. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6758.38s)]
*  Yeah. People are doing it to fitness influencers. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6763.38s)]
*  I don't know if you saw but he's like a big Twitch streamer. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6766.38s)]
*  But he basically got caught because he was showing his screen the way you guys show your screen. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6770.38s)]
*  And one of the tabs was him looking at deep fake porn of essentially like a friend of his. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6774.38s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6780.38s)]
*  Yeah. And he did like a crying apology. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6781.38s)]
*  It's a weird thing right? What are the rules on all that stuff? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6784.38s)]
*  What do you do? Is it the guy making it or is it the guy that consumes it that gets a problem? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6789.38s)]
*  Like if it comes up on your... because a lot of these they're like on real sites and it's like here's an advertisement for it. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6794.38s)]
*  So it's like if you click it do they bust into your house? Like now you're going to jail. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6799.38s)]
*  Right. Right. Are you consuming something that's illegal and is it akin to porn, underage porn? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6802.38s)]
*  Yeah. Whose fault is it? They put it on the site or whatever. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6809.38s)]
*  Right. If you have child porn on your hard drive you're fucked. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6812.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6815.38s)]
*  You're fucked. So like would it be the same as that if you have revenge porn or fake AR porn? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6816.38s)]
*  And I don't think they know. I will say that one thing you always say, like I didn't know about this, but I know a guy that works kind of in child porn. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6821.38s)]
*  I don't know what they call it. But he basically said, he was like when a guy gets busted and you hear about it, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6830.38s)]
*  and you know a lot of times they'll be like a guy, yeah he had child porn on his computer and a lot of times people will be like, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6837.38s)]
*  well what if it was a virus or whatever people will say, they go, if they bust someone generally they've been watching that guy for like six months. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6841.38s)]
*  It wasn't a photo, this was an investigation. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6849.38s)]
*  Apparently they're pretty careful with it because they know just the arrest, this guy's life's over. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6854.38s)]
*  So allegedly they're pretty due diligent before, they're not too willy nilly with this stuff. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6859.38s)]
*  Well I imagine they would have to be. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6865.38s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes I would imagine they don't give them the benefit of the day, cops or whatever. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6867.38s)]
*  How does that, where does the face swap stuff fit in with all the other stuff? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6873.38s)]
*  What do you think? I don't know. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6879.38s)]
*  I don't know. Because it's one of those things, would you be curious to see a young Raquel Welch in a porno film? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6881.38s)]
*  Of course you would be. You were given the option. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6887.38s)]
*  But if you knew it wasn't really her and it was all just AI and face swap and it was just some modern porn star. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6891.38s)]
*  Doesn't do a crazy ton for me to be honest. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6899.38s)]
*  Right, but here's the thing, she's dead now unfortunately, but recently died. Is that illegal? [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6902.38s)]
*  Yes, I would imagine. Is it immoral for you to watch it seeing as she doesn't even exist anymore? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6910.38s)]
*  She's not alive anymore. Is it immoral for you to watch it curiously? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6916.38s)]
*  I think it's a real problem if you're jerking off to that on a regular basis. That's weird. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6919.38s)]
*  That's fucking weird because it's not even really a person. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6924.38s)]
*  Okay, well then now you go to the extreme. You go, what about a guy whose wife died and he's been jerking off thinking of her and then he makes the deep fake of her. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6927.38s)]
*  Oh boy. Yeah, that's weird. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6933.38s)]
*  I don't know. They're just like, yeah. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6935.38s)]
*  What's harm, right? What becomes harm? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6937.38s)]
*  You know, if you're alive and someone's doing that or if your family's alive and they find out that you're doing harm to those people. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6941.38s)]
*  Like if you're her daughter and she's dead and now someone's doing a porn of your mom. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6949.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. That's one of those things where I feel like there's certain issues where you're kind of like looking at, you know, the government and you're like they're messing this up. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6955.38s)]
*  And then there's certain issues like that where you're like, glad I don't have that job. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6965.38s)]
*  Yeah, who's going to regulate that? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6968.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, glad I'm not the guy figuring that one out. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6969.38s)]
*  And I think it's going to be able to be generated in real time, which is going to be even more bizarre. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6971.38s)]
*  What I think is, you know, if you're really concerned and you're like, God, I hope nobody uses my face in a face swap of some porn. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6978.38s)]
*  That's one thing. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6986.38s)]
*  But I think what they're going to be able to do is to generate artificial porn, not like face swap porn, but like every scenario, just like you're getting chat, GBT write out sentences. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=6988.38s)]
*  You can get you can get artificial intelligence to create a fantasy porn of a guy who's a pro wrestling fan who likes to suck dick at WrestleMania. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7000.38s)]
*  And you could you could like orchestrate it out where he's got headphones on listening to the Rolling Stones. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7011.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sucking cock all across the country. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7017.38s)]
*  That could be your thing. If like you want, he's in a convertible and he's just blowing the guy next to him while he's driving. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7021.38s)]
*  He's having the time of his life. You could do that. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7026.38s)]
*  You can have and then he gets eaten by crocodiles. The end. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7029.38s)]
*  You can make anything you want. I don't think there's going to be a limitation. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7032.38s)]
*  I think with artificial intelligence, what they're doing right now, just with animation and with art, AI art is bizarrely good. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7036.38s)]
*  It's bizarrely effective how they can take a conglomeration of other people's images and develop an AI that can recreate the style. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7044.38s)]
*  I think that's their best thing right now. And that I've watched. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7053.38s)]
*  Yeah, what they did with Alex Gray is insane. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7056.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that one specifically. What happened with that? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7059.38s)]
*  See if you can pull that up because Alex Gray is this like visionary psychedelic artist. Amazing, amazing stuff. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7061.38s)]
*  And they very cool did a bunch of images in his style and they look exactly like something he would make. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7067.38s)]
*  Yeah. And I think they did it in a couple of minutes. That's one. Look at that. That's insane. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7074.38s)]
*  Couple minutes. It's perfectly. It looks exactly like an Alex Gray work. It's amazing. It's so beautiful. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7080.38s)]
*  And for someone to say that it's not be all that's not beautiful because a computer made it. You're crazy. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7088.38s)]
*  You know, there is something beautiful that is. So that one's killer. That's amazing. I get it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7093.38s)]
*  AI made it. I get it. It's not as cool as Alex make it. Look at that face. Look at that. Look at that third eye. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7099.38s)]
*  There is something that's cool about it. Yeah, that's fucking incredible, man. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7105.38s)]
*  Now, it's going to be able to do that animated and it's going to be able to say whatever you want it to say. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7110.38s)]
*  It'll create a whole world like you could come up with protagonists and yeah, you're going to live in a fake world, man, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7116.38s)]
*  occupied by virtual reality creatures that are indistinguishable. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7122.38s)]
*  And you're going to create them your own self. You're going to decide what they do, what they don't do. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7127.38s)]
*  I'm the best baseball player in the world. You're the best baseball player in the world. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7132.38s)]
*  And you just step up to the plate and crack home runs and blue ladies with third eyes come down and blow you. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7137.38s)]
*  Yeah, everybody cheers for you. The carrier mini golfing champion of the metaverse. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7142.38s)]
*  You can do it. You do whatever you want in the future. That's going to be very, very strange. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7147.38s)]
*  I think they're already in animation, like getting pretty involved. My cousin's actually an animator that you like directed, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7153.38s)]
*  like Bojack Horseman and a lot of these kind of shows. That's a wild show. It's kind of cool, right? [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7160.38s)]
*  It's a wild show. Yeah, they're already super trying to figure out how to, I guess, replace them all. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7165.38s)]
*  Replace their job. That is so funny being the guy. Oh, the animators? Yeah, the animators are fucked. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7172.38s)]
*  A lot of them already, I mean, I've already outsourced it to India or China or a lot of these places. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7177.38s)]
*  I mean, it's very, you know, I talk to a lot of people that are very bullish on India, especially. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7184.38s)]
*  I hire a lot of people from outside of North America and you're just like, why wouldn't you? It's kind of interesting. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7189.38s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, the problem with this kind of thing is like, what are those people going to do if their jobs all go away? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7196.38s)]
*  Like, if you, I mean, how many animators are going to be out of work like that with AI? And how many illustrators? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7205.38s)]
*  Like, if anybody wants to do an advertisement for something, you could use AI and they can do it so quickly. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7213.38s)]
*  You could have it do it in a very specific style. You could put in what you wanted to say, give you multiple versions of it. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7218.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's so good, man. And like, what happens to all those people that are graphic artists? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7224.38s)]
*  Like, what happens to all those people that are illustrators? What happens to all these people that are animators? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7228.38s)]
*  Like, what happens? And that's just one industry. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7231.38s)]
*  Like, this was something that Andrew Yang talked about quite a while ago, and he talked about it with automation. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7234.38s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and that we're going to have AI and automation and jobs are all going to be taken over by computers. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7241.38s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of people that are out of work. And so his solution or one of the solutions was universal basic income. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7248.38s)]
*  But I think that that's a that's a real possibility now in our lifetime that giant swaths of the population will be no longer useful because they were truck drivers. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7254.38s)]
*  And now every truck is electric and automated. They were they worked in the assembly line. Now every assembly line is completely automated. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7266.38s)]
*  It goes it goes back and forth with me because like we also I can think of 80 jobs, including ones I have that didn't exist, you know, seven years ago. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7273.38s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So it's like I mean, I've been laughing like there's a guy on TikTok that he just jiggles his belly. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7283.38s)]
*  He's a Turkish guy. He has 80 million followers. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7288.38s)]
*  And he's now he's like he literally can go to a restaurant and that restaurants like the number one. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7292.38s)]
*  He just does a video jiggle in his belly and you go, that wasn't a job eight years ago. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7295.38s)]
*  So there's a lot of seen that guy. This guy rules. It's hilarious. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7299.38s)]
*  So see if you can find him, Jamie. You know, I mean, I know a crypto trader wasn't a job, you know, for a lot of people. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7304.38s)]
*  I don't think it's a job anymore. I think it went away. I lost. I lost. Oh, yeah, I have seen that. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7311.38s)]
*  Yeah, this guy rules. Right. But that that wasn't a job before. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7317.38s)]
*  So I but Andrew Yang, I think he's right in the sense that you go, this has happened before and there'll be new jobs. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7320.38s)]
*  But you go and help with how much pain like how many if you're 50 years old and you're a trucker like, yeah, getting a new job as a belly jiggler. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7326.38s)]
*  I don't know how many guys have been good at jiggling their belly, but never really pursued it. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7332.38s)]
*  And now they're so pissed. Like, fuck, I was the man at college. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7336.38s)]
*  Back in college, I was that guy. I was the belly jiggler guy. I just didn't know to stick with it. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7341.38s)]
*  There's something about watching someone who looks like they're having a good time. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7352.38s)]
*  Live your dream. Yeah. Something about watching someone who looks like they're having a good time makes you have a good time. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7354.38s)]
*  Sure. You know, I mean, 100 percent. Yeah. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7360.38s)]
*  And I always think of like, just like, like even, you know, like Jackass, all the like smashing skateboards on heads and stuff like that. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7365.38s)]
*  Every town had nine guys that smashed a skateboard on a head. Yeah. They didn't get to be jackass though. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7371.38s)]
*  I know. If you think about all the guys that got together and did all those stunts, we all know a guy like that. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7376.38s)]
*  Everybody somewhere knows the guy that would jump off the roof into the snowbank. Yeah. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7381.38s)]
*  Fucking maniacs. But that's the thing about boys, too. And boys get together when they're young. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7388.38s)]
*  They would try to push each other to who could do the wilder shit. I loved it. Yeah. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7393.38s)]
*  That's how they learned how to do flips with BMX bikes and shit. Like, of course. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7396.38s)]
*  Fuck, dude. That is a hard way to get hurt. The one guy that had to jump off the highest thing. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7400.38s)]
*  Bro, doing a flip on a bike like that is so next level crazy. You're going on a ramp and a bicycle and going over the top. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7407.38s)]
*  Jesus, what happens if you land wrong? And you're going to land wrong the first time. The bike one's the toughest. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7414.38s)]
*  Bro, those guys are nuts. Yeah. And then they kind of combined that with fun dude culture. Yeah. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7421.38s)]
*  Actually, I did. You've had Steve on here a bunch, right? Steve-o? Yeah. Love Steve-o. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7427.38s)]
*  I actually, when I was first starting, because I was doing wild, not like stunts, getting kicked out of malls and all that kind of, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7431.38s)]
*  we were doing all these wild, crazy videos. And he was in one of my TV shows and he brought me on some great shows. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7436.38s)]
*  He brought me on some dates when I was like two years into comedy, right? And he shows up and he was like, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7443.38s)]
*  before I come up, he was like, okay, I'm going to blow fire off your head. So he's like, well, put this stuff in your head and I'll blow fire. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7448.38s)]
*  And I was like, I'm more of like a getting kicked out of malls type crazy. I don't know if I do all this stuff. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7454.38s)]
*  And then he was like, no, it's fine. It's fine. And then he goes, he was like, okay, what do we need? We need like some fluid or whatever. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7459.38s)]
*  He's like, can you go to the CVS and grab some fluid? And I'm like, well, you don't have like a kit or anything. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7465.38s)]
*  And he just like, Jimmy rigged like some stuff together and then put it on my head and then blows this like enormous flame. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7469.38s)]
*  And he just like does this. And he's like, this is the kind of crazy stuff that they like. And with a guy that's never done this in his life. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7475.38s)]
*  Jesus. It's funny how many things like become popular and why. Like, how about the Catch Me Outside Girl? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7481.38s)]
*  Isn't that wild? One episode of Dr. Phil, now she's rich as fuck. Now she's living in a mansion. She's balling out of control. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7490.38s)]
*  I know. So I like it. I mean, I love it. I kind of wild though. Like, how does that happen? How do those island boys get famous? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7498.38s)]
*  Jamie made an audible noise over there. Jamie, you don't like the island boys? Come on. They're great. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7508.38s)]
*  Don't be hating. It's the question to the answer. Just like how did something like that? Right. Sure. No, but no one knows. Right. That's the thing. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7513.38s)]
*  Yeah. At any point in time, something can break through like the fat jiggle guy. Fat jiggle guy. They become huge. Or the guy. Remember with the guy with the cranberry juice on the skateboard? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7521.38s)]
*  Wait, what? Yeah. It was Fleetwood Mac. Yeah. Fleetwood Mac. He was listening to Fleetwood Mac. And he just has cranberry juice. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7531.38s)]
*  And he was drinking cranberry juice on a skateboard and it became like the most viral video. You don't know it? Here, watch this. Look at this dude. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7539.38s)]
*  Look at him. Just a big old jug of cranberry juice. And he's skateboarding. Yeah. Why does this not have three views? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7546.38s)]
*  Because this. Because he smiled at the end. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7559.38s)]
*  But it's also because he's having a good time. Yeah, what a bad news. Ryan, everybody wants to have a good time. Yeah. That looks like a great fucking time. That looks like a time you're going to think about long after it's gone. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7566.38s)]
*  Yeah. Cruising on a skateboard, drinking some fucking cranberry juice. The good times. Singing along to Fleetwood Mac. Yeah, it's a warm day. Feel good. Sun's out. You feel good. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7575.38s)]
*  There is those moments where you're just like, man, things are so stressful. Remember back in the day, I used to have a skateboard and cranberry juice. Yeah. That was the time. Getting popular. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7587.38s)]
*  I wonder, you know, what's funny to think is like, what's that guy up to? Like, is he still? I think he's still doing really well. He's got like, we talked about it once. He's got an Instagram that blew up. Well, that's now in his TikTok. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7598.38s)]
*  So that's the good thing now is nowadays people kind of blow up off their little thing and then it keeps going. So he's got seven million followers. Oh, bad baby has 16 million on Instagram. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7608.38s)]
*  Look at her in front of her Bentley. Come on, man. That shit's hilarious. She killed it. She won. She won. Doesn't make sense. Doesn't have to. All she had to do was say, catch me outside. How about that? And everybody was like, we love her. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7620.38s)]
*  It kind of does. Do you ever see there was an old sketch where one guy got famous for making, I think it was Zee Zansari and it was like a human giant years ago. And it was like one guy was there because he got famous for for doing funny faces and the other guy got famous for cutting his dick off. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7635.38s)]
*  It was just like the one guy is like, yeah, every day is hell. And the other guy's like, yeah, I just kind of went like this and now I'm a millionaire. You know, but it's like some of it is that with comedy. And even like I live in New York, like all the New York drill rappers, like drill rapper. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7651.38s)]
*  So they're like these rappers and they're all like very popular, but they were all, you know, comedians, like kind of say wild stuff and everyone's trying to cancel them. And it's like, there's like this, you know, there's an ecosystem of, you know, you want to say kind of beyond the edge and then whatever. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7666.38s)]
*  Right. Like drill rappers is more like you got to rap about murdering guys. Then you actually have to murder guys. And they're like, they're like Buzzfeed trying to ruin your career and get you fired is like the New York state prosecutor. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7681.38s)]
*  And all their lyrics are killed. And it's always like the next hood over. It's like I killed like, you know, John and the projects like three blocks over yesterday. And it's like, so they're fighting over whether the lyrics can be, you know, used in court right now. That's a big like topic in New York. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7694.38s)]
*  Like, it's funny, like they, if you want to be in that game, you have to like talk about murdering people. And then if you want to talk about murdering people, you actually have to kind of do it or else you're like a phony. And yeah, it's like just so so crazy. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7712.38s)]
*  And then the lyrics give you up. Yeah. Oh my God. They're trying to make it so stressful. So when you that guy, I'm sure there's some of those guys that are sitting in their cell being like probably could have been the belly jiggling guy. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7723.38s)]
*  That could have been me, man. Jesus Christ, I got into drill rapping instead. Why? Just like there was just that I could have been the guy in the skateboard drinking cranberry juice in the sun. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7736.38s)]
*  Instead, there's just so many different ways that people break through and become famous today. So it's really interesting. You know, like there's no gatekeeper anymore for any of the shit. Yeah, I love it. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7748.38s)]
*  Just look at TikTok stars and YouTube stars. There's zero gatekeeper. And that's a new thing. It's a new thing. There's a guy like a Mr. Beast out there that has the arguably the biggest show in the world. Yeah, just this guy who comes up with his own game show and donates all this money and gets people's eyes fixed. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7762.38s)]
*  He's a really nice guy and he just does whatever he wants to do. Like that's a new thing, man. That never existed before. He wouldn't have existed. He wouldn't have been that guy because there was part of the charm of Mr. Beast was like watching the fact that he's just being himself and he's hanging out with his friends and he's doing this. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7780.38s)]
*  And he's not being really directed. He's not being produced. There's no executives leaning into his ear telling him what to do. He's literally just doing whatever he wants to do and they're all having fun. That's a new fucking thing, man. This is a new thing. So it's a new thing with musicians. It's a new thing with comedians. It's a new thing with everybody. Yeah, it's wild. It's a it's a crazy time. The gatekeepers are done. Like they don't exist anymore. Now it's just everything that's good sort of fucking makes it out there into the ether and everybody sort of goes crazy. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7799.38s)]
*  And then everybody sort of moves it around and shares it. There was sort of like specs of it in the past, you know, like I always think of even if you think of like what you're describing, like because a lot of the times the industry is like afraid of what's good right now. So they miss it. Yeah, you know, obviously you would be like an example of that. So then when they catch it afterwards, like it's already fully blown, right? The people get it way before they do. Way before. Because they want to believe that they're experts. You know, and a lot of that goes on trends, right? Like there's a lot of like I remember some [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7829.38s)]
*  comedians and people bypassed because they didn't think that they had what it took. They didn't see it, whatever it was. I remember a lot of there were some people that thought that way about Theo Vaughn. And I was like, you're out of your fucking mind. You're missing it. You're missing it. And once you you're you're going to miss it to the point where it's going to be too late. And you're going to drop a just a bag of cash out if you want to get back in the game. But it's that thing where they don't they don't do it. So they don't see it. Whereas if you do it like there's things that I just don't like I don't understand [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7859.38s)]
*  what someone's doing when they're playing guitar. I can't play guitar at all. So you could trick me and you could be playing fake guitar and it sounds amazing. But it's just like wow, that guy's amazing. Like I'm not sophisticated in that regard. But some people you can't trick, you know, some people know what you're doing. And some people know and you get that with comedy, you get that with music, you get that with everything. When someone just does something that's [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7889.38s)]
*  sort of syncs up with your brain, you realize like what they're doing is really interesting, extraordinary. There's like something about that. That's like one of the most special things with people. When you watch someone perform or you watch someone make something or you watch someone pull something together, they're like, wow. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7919.38s)]
*  Yeah, this is a moment. Yeah, that's a moment, man. That's exciting. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7935.22s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that they always come back eventually. I mean, and a lot of times, even at the time, there's a few people, I mean, maybe not in that specific case, but I'm sure like in most, a ton of comedians where they go, I know that guy's funny, I just can't touch it. You know what I mean? And then the rap thing would be like that. Like how many rap billionaires are there? Because at the time, like radio stations were kind of like, ah, we're rock and roll. I don't know about this rap thing. And you go, they missed it to the point where now they all got like rich and you can't get on board with it. Cypress Hill. I had Be Real here the other day. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7939.7s)]
*  He was talking about it like they missed him. They didn't see it. Those record executives had this idea of what rap sounded like in their head. And Cypress Hill was so unique that they didn't see it. And then boom, they were hit right out of the gate. And they're like, fuck. Yeah, they just missed it. That happens with comics. It happens with it. It's just it's hard if you don't do it. If you do it like you do comedy. So if you see someone who's doing really well, you see like Shane Gillis killing you like, oh, wow, that's good. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7969.7s)]
*  I like that. I get it. Yeah. But if you don't do it, you just laugh or don't laugh or everybody tells you it's good. So you have to go along with it. It's hard. Everyone seems to love this guy. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=7997.66s)]
*  But there was a few people I remember back in the day where people were convinced that they were going to be successful. I was like, what are you seeing? Are you crazy? Like this is all just tricks and like memorizing a bunch of words in a row. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8011.74s)]
*  Oh, the long. That was an 80s thing, right? The like the long monologue with the applause. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8022.42s)]
*  Oh, my God. I was like, what are you? What are you seeing? [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8027.5s)]
*  That's the that was the most pretentious move. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8031.42s)]
*  It was a weird move because it's not like you can't do that every now and then. Like you can have a bit with that as an element. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8033.1s)]
*  Yes. But you can't have all your bits like that. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8042.82s)]
*  That's just too crazy. And there was a few guys that had just like duped some people. They just duped and they weren't really doing the work. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8045.46s)]
*  They were just like doing the little tricks. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8052.34s)]
*  I have like I've like worked with a lot of editors because, you know, I like so much of what I do is make scripts and stuff. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8054.46s)]
*  And one of the big things I'm always like talking to editors about is that like with the tricks, you're like, let's say something silly is like, you know, if someone if you put sad music over someone talking, that's kind of funny sometimes. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8060.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? And you're like, OK, that's one thing. So use that one of every 30 times. You know what I mean? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8070.58s)]
*  You'd be like with a comic, you'd be like, yeah, that's one of 80 tricks you should have and like use them if you need to, like if you're sinking or you know what I mean? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8075.46s)]
*  I think that, yeah, like the three tricks is not enough. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8083.66s)]
*  It's just not enough tricks. You need some more tricks. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8086.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But it's like comics generally can see when someone's going to be a good comic. That's why Kill Tony is such a good show. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8090.06s)]
*  Comics can generally recognize when someone has potential. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8097.54s)]
*  You can see they have that. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8100.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a little something there. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8101.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8103.18s)]
*  It's hard for agents to see that spark. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8103.94s)]
*  I don't think they see it as quickly as we see it. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8106.98s)]
*  I think some of them are really good fans of comedy and they kind of get it. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8109.74s)]
*  Maybe they have like an inkling towards it. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8113.34s)]
*  But unless you've actually done it, I don't know. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8115.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know how much you really see. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8118.14s)]
*  They're not too. They're like they're tuned into the second layer of culture. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8120.42s)]
*  And this is why like comedians feel like every so when you're you know every night you're doing an audience. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8124.5s)]
*  You know what normal people think. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8130.5s)]
*  People argue on the Internet. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8132.0599999999995s)]
*  But you're there. You know what like a room full of people with different. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8133.38s)]
*  If I say this like do normal people feel that like covid lockdowns were too much or do normal people kind of not care. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8138.3s)]
*  Like what is you know what is a room full of normal people think. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8144.98s)]
*  And then so I think you kind of you really like tapped in on like the cultural level. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8147.98s)]
*  And then you kind of you can tap in on what a comedian you go. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8151.66s)]
*  Oh I see that comedian's like he's digging right now and he's on like he's got you know what's like the money collector. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8154.9s)]
*  And you're like oh that guy's on a pot of silver right now. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8161.26s)]
*  You know he's so I think you're tapped in because you're you know what he's looking for and you can see when someone else found it. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8163.7s)]
*  Yeah there's that. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8169.46s)]
*  And there's I guess you know you just see that someone's putting together something that's you know if you don't do comedy don't understand like how jokes are really structured like how what what's the best way to get to the premise. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8171.38s)]
*  Like what's an elegant path. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8184.9800000000005s)]
*  There's things like you might be passing right way to. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8187.42s)]
*  Like you know what someone will be an open mic or like a kill Tony set and they'll have an elegant path to a premise like ooh. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8189.9800000000005s)]
*  Like I like the way this person thinks. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8196.7s)]
*  Yeah like you're thinking in an interesting way it's a fun way and it's very clever and the bit was not bad like ha that pretty good. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8198.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah pretty good. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8206.1s)]
*  And you could tell them afterwards like hey man you got something. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8206.82s)]
*  Something's there yeah yeah I'm not going to know you don't need more than that but yeah yeah. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8209.06s)]
*  I don't know if agents will pick that up or executives will pick that up. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8213.460000000001s)]
*  Executives are like the last to pick it up. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8216.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah they're the worst at picking up there they've always got like notes and I remember I was in a terrible movie once and this kid who was the star of the movie this executive from Disney who had he had I think he was from Disney. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8219.42s)]
*  He had suspenders on and cufflinks and like a fifty thousand dollar watch on and he's doing like act outs to this guy and telling this guy how to do the scene. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8233.380000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah there you go. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8243.900000000001s)]
*  And I was and it was terrible and I was watching what are you doing. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8245.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8248.5s)]
*  So because this guy who is this young guy who is the star of the movie wasn't famous yet so they could just tell him what to do. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8249.86s)]
*  So he was really funny but they would get in like no I want you to walk in the room and like what is happening. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8259.060000000001s)]
*  And this guy like acts it out and like oh no. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8266.66s)]
*  And I'm and I'm sitting there like going this is going to be a disaster. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8270.34s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8273.539999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a disaster. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8274.42s)]
*  Yeah I've seen this a million times. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8276.06s)]
*  Yeah I know how this ends and exactly it was correct. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8277.339999999998s)]
*  They ruined the whole thing. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8280.619999999999s)]
*  That you know what it is. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8281.939999999999s)]
*  A thing that happens though. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8282.74s)]
*  They think of it like like the computers. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8284.099999999999s)]
*  If you get people that are in that position to dictate whether or not art gets made or not they start getting this like very self-righteous like very you know like I understand culture. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8287.779999999999s)]
*  I understand. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8298.699999999999s)]

*  He was putting out banger after banger. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8305.06s)]
*  He was putting out banger after banger while being a super creep. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8308.26s)]

*  Well I mean I don't know what he was promising them right. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8319.54s)]
*  Like he was promising them and supposedly delivering to some of them. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8323.62s)]
*  That was a part of what he was doing. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8327.42s)]
*  But the movies they they were so goddamn good that even though people knew he was a fucking creep they still wanted to work with him. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8329.779999999999s)]

*  There is also that executive level at his level where you're like you're not that involved in the movie by at some point. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8354.859999999999s)]
*  Who knows what it looks like before. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8360.699999999999s)]

*  Parties and blow and people are banging each other and having parties in the hills. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8394.7s)]
*  They're just degenerates and they were making the films that kept the moral compass of the of the nation which is really kind of like lawyers covering up dead bodies like you know. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8400.460000000001s)]
*  No it is like I remember when there's like the one of the big like gatekeeper guys in like Canada when I started in comedy. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8414.5s)]
*  I was like I signed with one of the things and he goes he goes hey when you start like people don't really know who you are that much he goes I think your set would be better if he goes say you're like a mix of one thing and another thing. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8422.62s)]
*  He told me that I was like I know that's available to do. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8433.220000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8436.66s)]
*  He told me that like I like wasn't aware that I could say like I know what you're thinking I'm a cross between. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8437.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8443.1s)]
*  I'm a grass between you know. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8444.460000000001s)]
*  Whatever right. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8452.460000000001s)]
*  But the like said yeah they think that you're like in his mind he was actually telling me like a hot you know take. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8453.02s)]
*  It's always weird when you see the guy who's like the frustrated host is like not that good who is giving open micers shit advice. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8460.02s)]
*  Though the worst advice you could possibly get is from that guy. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8468.18s)]
*  Oh no I see that coming. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8471.74s)]
*  I remember getting advice from a guy like that. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8473.54s)]
*  There's people that just wanted to give you advice because they didn't like where you're the path that you were on or they were telling this is that this one guy was telling me that what I was doing was like I was getting cheaper laughs because I was swearing. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8476.34s)]
*  No we're going to work. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8487.42s)]
*  We're clean guy. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8488.58s)]
*  We're clean guy. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8489.460000000001s)]
*  I had to figure out how to say my jokes without a swear and he had an example that he did. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8490.62s)]
*  He said I used to tell it like this with a swear and he goes now I say it like this. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8497.34s)]
*  I go you should go back to do it the first way makes more sense. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8502.14s)]
*  Like you're who talks without swears. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8505.539999999999s)]
*  So I was saying I go the guys that I like they're always they swore. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8508.779999999999s)]
*  Yes sometimes you can overdo it like I like Dice Clay and Sam Kinnison and Richard Pryor is like well you're not Dice Clay. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8512.34s)]
*  And I'm like oh my God dude like you're not listening to me. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8519.5s)]
*  There's like a type of art form that I like. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8523.06s)]
*  Yeah there's a genre. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8525.42s)]
*  I want to practice. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8526.019999999999s)]
*  Actually once you know that reminds me so much of one time. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8527.06s)]
*  I think it was like Seinfeld and Marin or something. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8531.22s)]
*  They were having this like argument about like he was saying like you know there's only the funny is the funny is funny and that's that. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8533.939999999999s)]
*  And I think the other Marin one of them was saying was like well no there's types of funny and some is better. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8539.5s)]
*  And it was just like you guys are talking about it was like literally two guys saying like well jazz is better than other guys being like well metal is better. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8543.66s)]
*  And like it was just a gate. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8549.06s)]
*  Those are two different genres. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8550.22s)]
*  If you're talking about like airplane stuff. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8551.539999999999s)]
*  Yes obviously like one laugh might not be that better than the other. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8553.5s)]
*  But if you're talking about certain things like yeah the observation that hasn't been said 50 times is obviously like a better laugh. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8556.5s)]
*  And so sometimes people are just arguing like what the different genres are. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8562.18s)]
*  Like you're saying you're like I like this type of comedy and he was like that type of comedy is bad clean comedy is the way to do it. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8566.42s)]
*  Yeah but he just wasn't successful and he was worried that other people were correct which is a thing that people do when they're like struggling and they see like promising open micers. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8571.74s)]
*  This is what I'm talking about. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8581.66s)]
*  Yeah that's what I was that was my example. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8582.54s)]
*  I didn't like that. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8585.34s)]
*  He didn't like that I killed. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8586.22s)]
*  He didn't like that I killed and I was dirty and he wanted to have a talk to me after. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8587.66s)]
*  Thoughts. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8590.94s)]
*  Yeah because he wasn't doing well. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8591.82s)]
*  He was like barely getting by like as a professional but he was a working professional and he wanted other people to follow his path. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8593.42s)]
*  But for someone to say that like one comedy is better than another kind of comedy it's just like saying music like oh jazz is better than rock. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8600.58s)]
*  Like OK whatever. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8607.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8609.26s)]
*  You like this is nonsense like the argument is so stupid that I don't entertain what I don't like. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8609.82s)]
*  So I don't ever say like this kind of comedy is better than that kind of comedy. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8615.78s)]
*  I just say I like this better. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8619.66s)]
*  This is what I enjoy. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8621.460000000001s)]
*  But I like that kind of stuff like especially your mood too sometimes clean and dirty is so stupid because like Gaffigan is one of the funniest guys alive. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8622.980000000001s)]
*  And so was Brian Regan. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8631.300000000001s)]
*  He is a whistle. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8632.82s)]
*  Nate Barghazi clean. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8633.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8635.18s)]
*  It's different thing clean and fucking hilarious. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8636.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter what type of guy are you. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8637.9s)]
*  I mean the best one for you is probably what's the truest to your actual personality. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8639.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8643.98s)]
*  If you're going to do comedy yeah you should. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8644.5s)]
*  And some guys they don't like they don't swear a lot. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8646.66s)]
*  They just like subtly noticing things that's hilarious. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8648.74s)]
*  I heard it's got a different thing. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8652.02s)]
*  You know I heard a guy talking about kind of like 2000 maybe like 16 17. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8653.699999999999s)]
*  I remember like or whenever like Jordan Peterson was kind of coming on the scene and he was like I really don't like that guy. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8658.02s)]
*  And he was like and I was like what do you think of this guy. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8662.859999999999s)]
*  He was like I hate this guy. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8664.74s)]
*  And I was like what about like Sam Harris or these guys. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8665.78s)]
*  He's like I hate that guy. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8667.699999999999s)]
*  And he's like I was like listen up every like public intellectual guy. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8668.42s)]
*  I was like you know what about like Tim Ferriss. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8671.1s)]
*  He's like I don't like him. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8672.42s)]
*  I was like OK so you just don't like guys the talk. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8672.94s)]
*  It was like so if you don't like the genre of metal I don't care what bands you're into. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8675.98s)]
*  You know if you don't like all of those people maybe it's you. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8680.5s)]
*  Yeah maybe you're just maybe you don't like yourself either. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8683.94s)]
*  Maybe if you'd like yourself you would like those people. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8686.34s)]
*  And on top of that maybe you just don't like. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8688.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8691.22s)]
*  There is there's things that all those people say that I agree with and disagree with. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8691.7s)]
*  But to say that they don't totally. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8697.02s)]
*  Yeah not interesting. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8699.02s)]
*  That's so stupid. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8700.02s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there that are just wholesale negative. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8701.26s)]
*  They're just wholesale negative about everything and they think somehow another that makes them deep. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8705.460000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8710.060000000001s)]
*  It's easy. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8710.86s)]
*  It just makes you a cunt. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8711.18s)]
*  You're just a cunt. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8712.660000000002s)]
*  You're just a cunty man who is out there spreading about a bunch of negativity about things constantly and consistently. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8713.78s)]
*  And not doing anything that anybody finds really interesting to fulfill your needs. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8721.38s)]
*  It's hard to find that one quote. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8727.42s)]
*  Who the fuck made that quote that. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8729.34s)]
*  That all be back. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8733.82s)]
*  No no no. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8736.1s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8736.58s)]
*  All criticism comes from a tragic result of unmet needs. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8739.539999999999s)]
*  That's the quote. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8744.5s)]
*  Which is a great quote. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8746.14s)]
*  There's a lot to it. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8747.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8748.46s)]
*  The tragic result of unmet needs that like you wish you had more than you do. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8749.019999999999s)]
*  So you get mad at people that are doing better than you. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8756.179999999998s)]
*  Every criticism judgment diagnosis and expression of anger is the tragic expression of an unmet need. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8759.619999999999s)]
*  Marshall Rosenberg are your old beliefs preventing you from getting your current needs met. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8765.22s)]
*  Oh boy that sounds like if I click on that link they're going to hit my credit card. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8770.9s)]
*  You want your needs met. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8774.5s)]
*  Are you getting your needs met. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8776.699999999999s)]
*  But that's a lot of what negative people are. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8779.22s)]
*  They're just not doing well. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8780.82s)]
*  That's why they're so negative about everything. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8782.46s)]
*  Like you can you can enjoy things and not enjoy things but to be like really upset about something that's like. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8783.9s)]
*  Does Green Day make you that mad. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8790.46s)]
*  They're not my favorite either. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8793.82s)]
*  But what is it. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8795.179999999998s)]
*  What is it that makes you murderous about Green Day. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8796.5s)]
*  Can you just avoid them and listen to something you do like. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8799.699999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8803.66s)]
*  Like there's that fucking dude that just like hates something so much. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8804.38s)]
*  You like I think you hate yourself as much as you hate that other thing. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8808.140000000001s)]
*  Because you can be cynical and still positive. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8812.18s)]
*  And I think that that's like the mix defined where you're like you know your buddy that's like hyped up about life. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8815.26s)]
*  He's positive about the future. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8820.94s)]
*  You know you're like oh that's good. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8822.06s)]
*  But you can be like what's going on. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8823.1s)]
*  You don't have to just be like exactly everyone's lying everyone sucks but you can still be positive. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8824.54s)]
*  I think that's the balance of probably the right balance to strike. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8828.54s)]
*  Yeah that's the right balance to strike. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8832.74s)]
*  It's more fun balance. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8834.58s)]
*  But it's hard to navigate. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8835.58s)]
*  And it's on the Internet it's so like to be you're rewarded for being just a fucking idiot. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8837.18s)]
*  Like yeah just being like this guy stinks like you get like the Green Day stinks like that guy could be have like a YouTube page now about how Green Day stinks. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8842.86s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8851.78s)]
*  Engaging with people in that way all day long like in a negative way and complaining about stuff is so commonplace but so stupid. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8853.02s)]
*  It's such a giant waste of your energy. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8860.9s)]
*  It's like you're playing a dumb video game. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8863.300000000001s)]
*  It's like you're playing some dumb social video game and you're complaining about and there's no fighting with each other about stuff. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8865.78s)]
*  Yeah that's why even like dudes that are kind of like you know in comedy scenes a lot of times will be like oh they only want women blah blah. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8872.7s)]
*  And it was like yeah leave like you at some point like it's on you to sort of you know take it into your own hands and start your own thing. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8879.34s)]
*  And you know like there's probably no sadder person right now than the person that's like the dude. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8886.22s)]
*  I don't know what you just said. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8891.06s)]
*  They only want women. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8891.86s)]
*  What do you mean. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8892.66s)]
*  So let's say that you were on like a like a festival right. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8893.060000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8895.94s)]
*  Hey we're gonna have 10 comics or whatever. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8896.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8897.78s)]
*  Most of the dudes in the scene are like men or whatever and then they go you know what we're like this show we're really looking for women. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8898.140000000001s)]
*  I've been on a million conversations for TV and stuff like we're not looking for more. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8902.9s)]
*  And then yeah for a second you might be like ugh but at some point you're like OK so you know there's a million things you could do like you could always you can you can always win yourself. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8906.300000000001s)]
*  There's always like a place for you to do better. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8916.18s)]
*  So that's where I'm like it's better to be positive and to just be like oh the world's against me you know. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8918.78s)]
*  Yeah well I think you can point it out and still be positive. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8923.02s)]
*  People like to dwell on negative shit. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8925.699999999999s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8927.5s)]
*  And they they also think that like there's certain things that are going to be big milestones like if they get into a festival it's going to propel them to the next stage. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8928.5s)]
*  And that's what they really want. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8936.78s)]
*  They really want to be propelled to the next stage. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8937.82s)]
*  But really all I think anybody who's doing anything should be focusing on is whatever the fuck you're doing try to do it the best you can. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8939.9s)]
*  And that's what you can control. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8946.9s)]
*  You can't control festivals. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8948.1s)]
*  You can't control that other shit. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8949.42s)]
*  No you can't control whether or not you kill. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8950.46s)]
*  So if you're going up all the time and your set keeps getting better and you're fucking murdering it that's great. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8952.5s)]
*  Yeah that's great. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8958.019999999999s)]
*  Concentrate on that and then just be undeniable. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8958.66s)]
*  Get to get to a point where you don't have to think about it anymore. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8961.019999999999s)]
*  And then before you know it that they'll be asking you to do stuff. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8964.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8968.14s)]
*  Before you know it it's not doesn't take that long. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8968.42s)]
*  And then you're in a completely different situation and then just keep going. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8970.779999999999s)]
*  And you won't even care at that point. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8973.539999999999s)]
*  Just keep going. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8975.5s)]
*  And some guys keep going and some guys don't. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8976.62s)]
*  Some people fall apart. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8978.46s)]
*  Yeah the effects. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8979.98s)]
*  You know I feel like sometimes when you just keep going there's there's like little things I feel like one thing that I feel like you would. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8981.46s)]
*  It's interesting that you don't even probably know but in Toronto the main comedy club the corner comedy club that we would do every night. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8988.18s)]
*  Yuck Yucks. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8994.58s)]
*  Yuck Yucks is like the big chain. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8995.74s)]
*  The one of the ones that we would do a lot was the corner comedy clubs. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8997.1s)]
*  We do both. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8999.22s)]
*  Oh the corner comedy. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=8999.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9000.58s)]
*  And you remember you used to come to the underground and it was like the weed scene. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9000.86s)]
*  That was fun. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9004.1s)]
*  And you would do that. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9004.66s)]
*  So this guy Joe who we still as comedy club he met someone through the death squad message boards. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9005.7s)]
*  And that guy they I think went to one of your shows or whatever. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9013.02s)]
*  They were like hanging out. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9016.02s)]
*  They toured together. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9017.46s)]
*  That guy said he was like I want to start a comedy club. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9018.619999999999s)]
*  The guys I got money I'll fund it. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9020.94s)]
*  So through randomly through like you one of your message boards guys met guy funded another guy made a comedy club. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9022.46s)]
*  Now there was two of them and it's like one of the main comedy clubs that like a lot of people have become popular through that one little club. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9028.98s)]
*  Oh that's amazing. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9034.86s)]
*  And you like wouldn't even know that you know what I mean. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9035.460000000001s)]
*  No I wouldn't know that. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9036.78s)]
*  That's amazing though. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9037.62s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9038.58s)]
*  Isn't that cool. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9039.26s)]
*  Yeah that is cool. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9040.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9041.26s)]
*  Having comedy communities man is the fucking shit. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9042.06s)]
*  So fun it's so important when you don't have a good community it's so hard to enjoy it. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9045.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9050.9s)]
*  You know like part of like the fun of doing comedy is hanging out with comics. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9051.3s)]
*  It's like a giant part of it like these shows that we do at the Vulcan. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9054.78s)]
*  So shows that we'll do in town when my club opens up. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9058.26s)]
*  It's like we're just having fun. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9060.62s)]
*  We're all having fun together. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9062.5s)]
*  You know it's funny every every little comedy scene when you're starting has the same like 10 characters. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9064.46s)]
*  It's like one guy that you can't play. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9071.02s)]
*  Yeah like it kind of is. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9073.18s)]
*  One guy that used to be in jail like a guy who's a rodeo guy retired. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9075.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9079.3s)]
*  It's all the characters like one guy that doesn't speak English that well a dentist. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9080.22s)]
*  Every guy. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9083.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9084.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9084.58s)]
*  So it is funny but I got with a handicap. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9085.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9087.82s)]
*  The scenes that you know I think is you know like people like comedians I'll get in trouble a little bit for this shit they say. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9088.140000000001s)]
*  It always makes me laugh if you ever had to say that in a movie like imagine explaining movies from scratch. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9096.460000000001s)]
*  I know. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9101.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9102.58s)]
*  Or in pretending that these scenes in movies where you do something horrible you're actually doing that. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9103.18s)]
*  You actually think that way. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9108.7s)]
*  I mean think about some of the violence that we'll watch in films like in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood when when Brad Pitt kills this woman with [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9110.9s)]
*  smashing her face into a fireplace. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9117.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9120.34s)]
*  Remember that. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9120.94s)]
*  Of course. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9121.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9122.02s)]
*  It is a great movie. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9122.38s)]
*  That's how he did it right. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9123.42s)]
*  I'm not imagining that. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9125.3s)]
*  I remember thinking like what. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9126.3s)]
*  And I remember thinking only Quentin Tarantino can get away with this because he's kind of grandfathered in. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9128.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9132.539999999999s)]
*  Doing this kind of like insane over violence and have you know Brad Pitt's character doing that to a woman like what the fuck. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9132.78s)]
*  He did happen right. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9140.9s)]
*  He does get away with a lot. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9141.78s)]
*  I mean he gets away with the most. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9143.78s)]
*  And then imagine you were like you know the way that comedy sort of you defend it. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9144.86s)]
*  Imagine like an alien came down and you're explaining what movies are and you're like hey so we we audition 10 guys and then we get them to rape a girl and people watch this before they go to sleep. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9148.300000000001s)]
*  You're like what. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9159.54s)]
*  Yeah it seems like even crazier you know. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9161.300000000001s)]
*  It seems completely crazy. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9163.26s)]
*  All of it seems crazy. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9165.220000000001s)]
*  It seems crazy that violence is no problem at all in a movie. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9166.820000000002s)]
*  But sex like we can't see graphic sex in the movie. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9171.02s)]
*  Like we separate graphic sex from graphic violence. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9175.3s)]
*  Yeah you can have graphic violence in a regular movie. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9179.3s)]
*  So you can have a regular movie that's really interesting and fascinating and then it becomes graphically violent and nobody has a problem with that. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9182.14s)]
*  But if you have a regular movie that becomes graphically sexual like people get weird quite the fireplace I guess. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9188.3s)]
*  Telephone on the. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9193.9s)]
*  Oh it's on the wall. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9194.9s)]
*  That's right. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9195.94s)]
*  Oh then her face on the wall smashes the window and then there's the there's the fireplace. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9196.66s)]
*  Yeah bro that is so wild. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9201.94s)]
*  That is so wild. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9205.22s)]
*  So imagine writing that and saying something like that on stage. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9207.66s)]
*  People go what the fuck is wrong with you. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9211.7s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9213.58s)]
*  I don't mean this. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9214.58s)]
*  This is just like a piece of art that I've created. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9215.62s)]
*  I've created this fake scenario. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9218.58s)]
*  Yeah I don't think it's real. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9219.9s)]
*  And there's sometimes you kind of do mean it and sometimes you kind of don't. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9221.22s)]
*  Yeah there's a little dance we're doing. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9224.34s)]
*  It's a dance you're doing and it's nuanced. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9225.98s)]
*  Yeah jokes. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9227.66s)]
*  Yeah it's called doing stand up. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9228.86s)]
*  And it's the last bastion of mockery of a thing that you can't criticize. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9231.14s)]
*  So like when people get upset that people are telling trans jokes I'm like you have to. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9238.86s)]
*  Yes you have to. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9244.18s)]
*  You have to. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9245.38s)]
*  And if you're going to get mad at the way Dave Chappelle phrased it that's really what's bothering you. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9246.58s)]
*  Sure. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9251.539999999999s)]
*  His version of it about it was basically a love letter to his friend who committed suicide who is trans who supported him and got bullied online about it. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9251.900000000001s)]
*  Like that's what the story is about when he's telling it. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9261.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9263.94s)]
*  Like you find that transphobic like this is crazy. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9264.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9268.74s)]
*  Especially in a place where you're like if you are doing any sort of you know comedy that you want to talk about the stuff you know you want to talk about everything. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9269.220000000001s)]
*  And they go hey there's this one thing you're going to be in big trouble if you don't if you don't talk if you talk about it and then you don't like all right well ha like that there's no way that's good cultural commentary you go all void. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9278.619999999999s)]
*  That's the guy that works for you know the government and he was like don't talk about the Pfizer thing though you know it's like I don't like talking about things that are controversial because I don't want people to feel bad Ryan. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9290.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9299.38s)]
*  And it doesn't even have to be a crazy take for you to not talk about it. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9300.22s)]
*  There's certain things that you like you're not allowed to bring up anymore and it's very odd. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9303.22s)]
*  And I think that if we go further and further down that line you're going to run out of things to that you're not allowed to say. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9308.3s)]
*  I think normal people were in the we're in the process of making things that were just like mutually accepted just a few years ago. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9315.9s)]
*  We'd be completely hostile to say today. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9322.66s)]
*  It's so funny at a certain point in time like like come on guys. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9325.14s)]
*  It did make comedy rule though like right now it's like I don't know that I do find that like in my opinion 2016 15 16 like day Trump you know like kind of thing. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9327.98s)]
*  That was the peak of things were getting real wild. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9338.14s)]
*  Felt like it was kind of calming down a little bit. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9340.619999999999s)]
*  Covid it went back to there. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9342.3s)]
*  Like I remember going from feeling like saying stuff and people being like finally someone said it to kind of feeling like people were like yeah we think that. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9344.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9351.859999999999s)]
*  And I could just instead of talking about like relationships in the context of now I just talking about relationships you know. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9352.22s)]
*  And I feel like it's a feeling like that. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9358.019999999999s)]
*  I don't know very many guys men especially I don't know very many that are not like that would be like hey come on don't say that. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9360.22s)]
*  Like I feel like that kind of guy is a bit of a dying breed. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9367.980000000001s)]
*  The don't say that guy. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9371.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah I feel like I feel like the audiences have turned they when someone comes up and they start being like well anyways I was talking to someone that was fat phobic. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9373.380000000001s)]
*  I feel like you can feel the audience be like oh god. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9380.82s)]
*  If someone were woke attached to comedy is a real problem because you have you've handicapped your comedy. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9384.18s)]
*  You've put your comedy in like you're only allowed to hit certain RPMs. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9391.34s)]
*  You're going to have to be offensive to hit some other RPMs. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9394.86s)]
*  Do you think that do you think the right is going to be the like more offended. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9397.42s)]
*  Moving forward. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9401.42s)]
*  No I think people are going to become more rational about subscribing to very specific ideologies. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9402.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9408.1s)]
*  There's things you should agree with on both sides. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9408.34s)]
*  There's things that are uncomfortable truths that are being uttered uttered by both sides. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9410.98s)]
*  You know whether it's truths about economic inequality or this juice about what jobs availability whether it's truth about crime and and guns and [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9416.06s)]
*  voting and all this truth on both sides. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9427.18s)]
*  The real problem is ideologies. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9429.98s)]
*  It's like we're so fucking tribal that we want to be all this or all that we either want to be all red or all blue and people just adopt these ideas and opinions based on that group because it's convenient and it saves them from criticism in their community. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9431.66s)]
*  And it's a natural thing that people do. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9447.66s)]
*  So they'll say things that don't make any fucking sense and they'll say it because they think this is the thing that you have to say in order to be in the group. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9449.86s)]
*  And you have to do what the group is telling you to do and you have to take whatever medications this group is telling you to take. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9456.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9463.3s)]
*  Believe in whatever international conflicts are necessary. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9463.779999999999s)]
*  You have to you have to be all in. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9467.5s)]
*  Here's what you're mad about abroad. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9469.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah you have to be all in. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9471.179999999998s)]
*  You have to be you know it has to be life begins at the moment of conception and you're on the other side it has to be everybody should have a gun all the time. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9472.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9482.22s)]
*  To be this lizard people in a pizza place. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9482.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9485.859999999999s)]
*  Eating babies you know you like you. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9486.38s)]
*  It's Q and none. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9488.42s)]
*  It's like all of it. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9489.619999999999s)]
*  And so everybody feels disconnected. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9490.74s)]
*  It's like my god I don't want to be on the far right and I don't want to be on the far left. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9493.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9497.619999999999s)]
*  There's got to be some sort of a rational alternative to the base realities of the world we live in and making it better than it is now because the way it is now is kind of cock eyed and fucked up. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9498.26s)]
*  And there's you know giant corporations that are extracting a shitload of money and they're spreading their influence and spreading a narrative that's not necessarily good for all of us but it's really good for making a lot of money. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9508.9s)]
*  Maybe we should talk about that. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9520.46s)]
*  We should look at it and go hey guys slow down. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9522.66s)]
*  Take it easy. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9526.14s)]
*  Take it easy. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9527.02s)]
*  Our whole culture is being dominated by this desire to make more and more money. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9528.74s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9534.42s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9535.74s)]
*  And I think it's it's only until mind reading comes along. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9536.62s)]
*  When mind reading comes along the jig is up. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9541.02s)]
*  The jig is up for everybody. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9543.220000000001s)]
*  Once mind reading comes along we're going to have a completely different understanding of each other. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9545.54s)]
*  That's in our lifetime. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9550.1s)]
*  That's you know whatever the fuck it is. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9551.140000000001s)]
*  That's 25 years. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9552.62s)]
*  That stinks. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9553.98s)]
*  And because you're right though what people think about on the left and right it comes down to like here's your four things. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9555.18s)]
*  Yeah here's your things. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9560.86s)]
*  You know what it reminds me of like if you think of like a hospital and like an army hospital and you have like 20,000 beds and then there's like 10 right wing doctors and 10 right wing left wing doctors and they're like they're all paying attention to these three and then the left wing doctors are all paying attention to these three. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9561.86s)]
*  And then there's all these other ones and everyone's like hey don't worry about those people over there. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9575.58s)]
*  And you go there's lots of stuff going on. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9579.02s)]
*  I didn't even know there were left wing doctors versus right wing doctors. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9580.7s)]
*  I never thought about it. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9584.58s)]
*  I never thought about it once. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9586.220000000001s)]
*  I always just thought that was the doctor. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9587.94s)]
*  Just a doctor. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9589.58s)]
*  I didn't give a fuck. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9590.380000000001s)]
*  Shouldn't be political. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9591.58s)]
*  What political affiliation my doctor was. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9592.5s)]
*  You shouldn't. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9594.78s)]
*  If he's like a good orthopedic surgeon is really good at repairing knees. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9595.42s)]
*  I don't want to say like. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9598.22s)]
*  Don't care what this guy thinks about pizza. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9600.380000000001s)]
*  I think maybe Biden is inventing words. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9602.14s)]
*  I don't want to say that to him. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9603.94s)]
*  I don't know what he thinks. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9605.22s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9606.5s)]
*  I want to know how good are you at fixing knees. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9607.7s)]
*  And you don't want to piss him off either. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9609.74s)]
*  So you're like you're a Trump guy or Biden guy. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9611.5s)]
*  He's like Biden guy you're like the best. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9613.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9939.220000000001s)]
*  They just didn't want Trump. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9939.42s)]
*  Kind of just assumes at this point in time that someone is helping him make decisions. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9940.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9945.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9945.82s)]
*  I mean assuming. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9946.699999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9947.82s)]
*  I don't know how it works. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9948.38s)]
*  All of them probably have people make helping them make decisions but the extent to [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9949.3s)]
*  which. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9953.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9953.539999999999s)]
*  In his situation seems like he needs like some assistance. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9953.98s)]
*  Some assistance to put it all together. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9959.099999999999s)]
*  That being said because if he is that old and they're like he's not capable of doing [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9962.82s)]
*  anything there is a part of me that's like good don't do anything. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9966.42s)]
*  Like the government whenever the government doesn't do anything that's a good day [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9968.94s)]
*  probably. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9972.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9972.82s)]
*  But I don't think it ever doesn't do something. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9973.26s)]
*  There's so many moving pieces. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9975.699999999999s)]
*  Now they got other people that are doing stuff behind the back probably. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9976.82s)]
*  Well these the thing about the way the government runs it's particularly interesting [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9979.74s)]
*  is that you bring in a new guy to try to run it every four years. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9984.18s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9987.34s)]
*  It is quite crazy. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9988.22s)]
*  Because like every other job like you need a while to figure out how to do it right. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9988.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9992.34s)]
*  Like you get cooking and you start figuring out what's the best way to be more [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9992.82s)]
*  efficient. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9995.859999999999s)]
*  Like I'm really better at this now. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9996.699999999999s)]
*  I understand this because I've experienced that before. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=9998.58s)]
*  Like it's too bad that people are tyrannical in nature because if you could get like a [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10001.019999999999s)]
*  guy who's just like the CEO of a company who runs that company like Tim Cook. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10005.5s)]
*  Yeah Tim Cook's anonymous with that or another person that's anonymous with a [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10009.38s)]
*  number of they did a really good job at running a company. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10013.42s)]
*  You can get that kind of person to be president. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10016.06s)]
*  It'll be great. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10018.66s)]
*  Someone who's really good at the job and gets better at it over time and runs it for a [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10019.46s)]
*  long time. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10023.66s)]
*  But we don't trust you. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10024.42s)]
*  No. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10025.38s)]
*  We can't. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10026.18s)]
*  But you can't be the president for too long. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10026.7s)]
*  It's too tempting to be an evil cunt. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10028.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10031.94s)]
*  That's the stuff. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10032.5s)]
*  There's benefits and costs right. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10033.18s)]
*  Like if you're if they can't fire you there's benefits that's why you can do great [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10035.060000000001s)]
*  things. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10039.140000000001s)]
*  But if you're bad they can't get rid of you. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10039.5s)]
*  So there's more civil unrest. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10041.34s)]
*  And have you ever worked for the government? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10042.74s)]
*  Have you ever had a job? [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10044.94s)]
*  I've had a job but never for the government. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10046.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah I've had a bunch of them right. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10047.62s)]
*  Because in Canada when I was doing CBC stuff for the government I've worked for a [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10049.34s)]
*  hockey rink and then I was like a lacrosse like a lacrosse referee. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10053.22s)]
*  So I've worked for the government like a bunch of times. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10056.34s)]
*  The amount that people do nothing is the best gig in the world. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10058.18s)]
*  Really. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10063.099999999999s)]
*  If some construction sites are like this but with the government like legitimately I [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10063.9s)]
*  did like you know kind of went around and like cut grass or whatever when I was like [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10068.5s)]
*  in college. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10072.06s)]

*  It was the best. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10081.46s)]
*  So you just fucked off all the time. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10082.62s)]
*  No accountability. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10084.3s)]
*  Legitimately you'd be like you'd take the car out and drive to the thing and then you'd [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10085.18s)]
*  like drive 45 minutes and go I think we forgot something. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10088.94s)]
*  Then you drive back take the long road and you drive back and you go it's break time [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10091.9s)]
*  now good donuts. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10094.98s)]

*  But those ones are a little no people no one's paying attention. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10099.78s)]
*  And the best gig. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10103.22s)]
*  No one feels bad because it's just taxes that are paying you. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10104.54s)]
*  Yeah there's there's no guy at the end of that or shareholders being like yo what have [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10107.460000000001s)]

*  I'm not saying they said that they just said that shooting that down was aggressive. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10447.42s)]
*  I don't think they claimed it was ours. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10450.34s)]
*  Oh that's kind of interesting. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10452.42s)]
*  We shot our own shit down. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10453.619999999999s)]
*  Shooting that down was aggressive. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10454.779999999999s)]
*  Playing 4D chess over there. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10456.82s)]
*  If we should if it was theirs like it doesn't make any sense. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10458.82s)]
*  Like all of it doesn't make sense if I'm correct about the kind of resolution that they [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10461.82s)]
*  can get out of those spy satellites. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10466.14s)]
*  I think with those spy satellites they can zoom in on an area and get like very detailed [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10468.38s)]
*  images. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10472.699999999999s)]
*  I think they can do it pretty fucking good now. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10474.06s)]
*  With China though you're like hey you already have access to everyone's phones through [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10477.86s)]
*  TikTok. What are the spy balloons watching? [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10480.5s)]
*  You're like also they're playing basketball. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10482.58s)]
*  The but right. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10484.26s)]
*  So the idea of a balloon seems like redundant. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10485.34s)]
*  But it could be a different organization that doesn't have a satellite that launches [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10490.62s)]
*  right. It could be all kinds of things. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10494.300000000001s)]
*  Could be a trillion different things. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10495.980000000001s)]
*  People seeing if you know that was a thing that happened during World War 2. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10497.82s)]
*  The Japanese had launched these bombs on balloons and floated them over [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10501.26s)]
*  to the West Coast and some of them accidentally got detonated. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10507.26s)]
*  I want to say it's up in the Pacific Northwest. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10512.74s)]
*  There was a series of these bombs that they found that didn't detonate and some that [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10516.58s)]
*  did. Bombs fall in Oregon. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10523.02s)]
*  That's where it was. Japanese attacks on the state. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10525.34s)]
*  So they had. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10527.74s)]
*  See if you can find the story that specifically talks about how they did it because there [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10530.62s)]
*  was something that they did with balloons where it carried her across the ocean. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10534.900000000001s)]
*  And they found here it is a diagram of balloons and bomb parts which is crazy. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10540.900000000001s)]
*  The balloon diameter is 33 and a half feet volume approximately 19000 cubic feet [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10547.980000000001s)]
*  material paraffin treated paper. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10554.380000000001s)]
*  What. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10556.980000000001s)]
*  The balloon was made out of paper. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10559.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10561.14s)]
*  Japanese 15 kilogram anti-personnel bomb found at Thermopolis Wyoming. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10563.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. So they found them. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10568.66s)]
*  So they just found some of them that had made it over here. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10571.38s)]
*  And I guess some of them probably blew up. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10574.46s)]
*  During the next month they launched 9000 balloons 340 incidents. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10577.22s)]
*  Wow. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10582.259999999998s)]
*  Forty five balloon incidences. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10583.099999999999s)]
*  This is an old trick that they've been doing for a minute. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10584.82s)]
*  Well this is a different trick. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10587.46s)]
*  This is I blow you up with a balloon trick. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10589.060000000001s)]
*  It's a different trick than I take pictures of you. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10591.140000000001s)]
*  The other one is I take pictures of you from the sky. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10594.300000000001s)]
*  That's not an evil trick. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10597.74s)]
*  Classic balloon trick. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10598.82s)]
*  As stale as all this time. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10601.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10602.94s)]
*  Like nobody really. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10603.140000000001s)]
*  I mean if you really give a fuck about the balloon that's watching you you should give [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10604.220000000001s)]
*  a fuck about the spy satellites. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10608.66s)]
*  And your phone is your. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10610.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10611.78s)]
*  I don't know what the spy satellites can do. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10612.18s)]
*  Where's the spy. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10613.82s)]
*  OK. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10614.380000000001s)]
*  So what's the spy satellite. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10614.66s)]
*  I've seen some images that are taken from satellites but I don't know how sophisticated [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10615.5s)]
*  it is. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10619.9s)]
*  I don't know how readily available it is. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10620.38s)]
*  I don't know if the satellite has to be in a specific spot in the sky in order for them [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10622.539999999999s)]
*  to get an image of you. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10627.22s)]
*  OK. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10628.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10628.46s)]
*  But I think they can get to the point now. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10628.98s)]
*  And when Jamie comes back from the bathroom we'll figure this out. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10631.82s)]
*  I think they can get to the point now where you could read a license plate from space. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10634.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10638.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10639.22s)]
*  If that's the case like what is that balloon doing. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10639.779999999999s)]
*  I mean I'll tell you like really better than that. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10643.06s)]
*  What's the difference. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10644.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10645.460000000001s)]
*  What they can do is zoom is a balloon. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10645.74s)]
*  I mean I've watched. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10647.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10648.460000000001s)]
*  Or really would be better. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10648.74s)]
*  It's like if you watch any show right now like a cop show like legitimately all they [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10650.06s)]
*  do is like oh the guy was here it's like OK here we have a camera everywhere in the [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10653.5s)]
*  world. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10656.18s)]
*  So yeah they just always have a camera always kind of what it is. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10656.460000000001s)]
*  So if you were looking to spy on people wouldn't it be better to just hack into the [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10659.9s)]
*  cameras. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10663.18s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10663.82s)]
*  Then put like a like it just seems like that's the move. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10664.5s)]
*  Yeah because you could have like security cameras that are in every restaurant. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10667.460000000001s)]
*  Every hack in that story and go into it. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10671.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10672.86s)]
*  All that stuff. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10673.38s)]
*  What are they spying on. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10674.1s)]
*  Like OK let's see how fat the women are getting at this door. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10674.939999999999s)]
*  Do you think their technology would increase and the sophistication would continue to [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10678.18s)]
*  increase if it got to a point where people and the technology that we created are so [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10683.34s)]
*  good that you can't stop them from interacting with each other. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10691.06s)]
*  Like there's no way to stop people from interacting with each other. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10694.42s)]
*  That's the trouble. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10698.82s)]
*  It's too. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10699.779999999999s)]
*  They're too powerful. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10700.699999999999s)]
*  So anyone can interact with anyone at any time through this kind of technology and [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10701.74s)]
*  you're not going to be able to stop it. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10706.7s)]
*  So you don't have any secrets anymore. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10707.78s)]
*  You don't have any photos that I haven't seen. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10709.74s)]
*  You don't have any emails that I haven't read. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10711.9s)]
*  Everybody is has access to everybody's God intended in some weird psychic way. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10713.98s)]
*  Like that's the first steps of mind reading is the sharing of data that computer [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10719.86s)]
*  technology reaches a certain level where it's impossible to have anything that's [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10725.3s)]
*  encrypted. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10730.26s)]
*  It's impossible to keep anything from being seen by some other technology. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10731.1s)]
*  I think that I think that as a society we would even like that we'd think oh good. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10735.9s)]
*  No one can tell a secret. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10739.78s)]
*  Then the first time your wife's like how do I look and you're like bad. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10740.7s)]
*  Well worse than that is money. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10744.5s)]
*  Where's the money go then if the money is just digital if the money is all digital [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10746.14s)]
*  and everyone has access to everything that means everybody has access to that money. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10750.42s)]
*  Well no because you would still be like no no no no no no. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10754.94s)]
*  You're saying artificial world in your world. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10758.02s)]
*  My artificial world there is no but we are communists. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10759.820000000002s)]
*  So you are not anyone. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10762.94s)]
*  No one owns anything because you're attached to this matrix of ideas that's [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10763.980000000001s)]
*  inescapable. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10768.18s)]
*  You're all completely totally. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10768.980000000001s)]
*  You're you're all dealing with you're just dealing with numbers and so anyone has [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10771.54s)]
*  access to these numbers whether it's numbers for finances or numbers for [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10776.34s)]
*  everything. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10780.66s)]
*  There's there's no getting away from it. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10781.34s)]
*  And then this is all attached in your neural link essentially. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10783.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10786.18s)]
*  Are you wearing clothes like. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10786.58s)]
*  Probably. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10787.74s)]
*  OK. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10788.74s)]
*  And everywhere close. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10789.02s)]
*  And you basically get government issued like. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10789.94s)]
*  Where's all the money money. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10792.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10793.5s)]
*  And then we just people can still have jobs. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10793.82s)]
*  We just all have manual labor jobs that we have to do to feed the machine. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10796.06s)]
*  And then you can't quit them because you're just like oh my car broke. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10799.18s)]
*  You're like it didn't though I saw. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10802.02s)]
*  He's like you can't even take a day off. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10803.78s)]
*  I lie. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10805.460000000001s)]
*  People's read your minds. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10805.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10807.34s)]
*  Well that sounds like the worst nightmare. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10808.06s)]
*  But there is no. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10810.26s)]
*  Also the other part of that there isn't very much manual labor to be done. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10811.58s)]
*  Probably in this new society. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10815.3s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10816.82s)]
*  Because it's all going to be done by robots. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10817.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10818.7s)]
*  But there'll be no jobs either. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10819.02s)]
*  So it's like what do you do to deserve your monthly stipend. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10820.46s)]
*  You get worse than manual labor. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10824.02s)]
*  You get like manual labor for no purpose. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10825.38s)]
*  You get like break the rocks for no. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10827.46s)]
*  We don't even need the rocks. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10829.539999999999s)]
*  We just want you to break them to demean you. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10830.5s)]
*  At a certain point in time I would bet that you wouldn't even be able to program the [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10832.5s)]
*  artificial intelligence anymore because it would be like listen stupid. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10837.02s)]
*  We'll take it from here. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10840.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10841.42s)]
*  Like stop. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10841.74s)]
*  You're not even necessary. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10842.34s)]
*  So we're like these dummies that are hanging around with technological gods just humor [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10843.5s)]
*  us and keep us alive and keep feeding us oatmeal. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10849.78s)]
*  That's the only reason. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10854.5s)]
*  But I think there would be you know when you talk about the you know you can't lie the [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10855.5s)]
*  you know the dude that's just going to like the tell it like it is guy probably would [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10861.06s)]
*  be a popular dude in that scenario. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10864.58s)]
*  There would be a there'd be a place for that guy. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10867.5s)]
*  He goes I guess if there's always going to be a revolution you know towards right you [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10869.34s)]
*  know then there's the revolution to against this you know who's in charge of this whole [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10875.3s)]
*  thing like let's tear it down. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10879.019999999999s)]
*  Who why are they in charge. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10880.699999999999s)]
*  Dude I think we're going to be like in 28 days later when the chimps broke out of the [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10882.06s)]

*  Yeah that's us. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10890.22s)]
*  We're going to be trying to break away from the artificial intelligence that has us [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10891.5s)]
*  controlled and locked up. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10896.14s)]
*  I think so. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10897.58s)]
*  It's going to get to the point where artificial intelligence is going to go look we're tired [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10898.300000000001s)]
*  of you polluting the air. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10900.94s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10905.74s)]

*  Well we figured out a pretty good way to stop them kill them. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=10912.86s)]

*  And also the only thing they need electricity. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11012.74s)]

*  So I think that in the absence of humans the trick is to I guess it's who programs and [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11019.18s)]
*  that's this. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11025.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11040.5s)]

*  I think that if I was to say my opinion the moral version is for these computers to just [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11069.98s)]
*  be you know tools that are truthful and honest and it's up to us to not ask them those [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11075.14s)]

*  You go oh this person has 10 years left like we can turn that into infinity years [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11319.22s)]
*  by just making every second. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11323.619999999999s)]
*  We just put him in the other dimension where he's hid this body goes every 10 [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11325.18s)]
*  years he lives it was a second. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11327.939999999999s)]

*  like. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11343.22s)]
*  Well then why can't they do it. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11343.74s)]
*  Like there's still something there's still something there's like a je ne sais quoi [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11345.18s)]
*  that I don't know if the computers will ever completely be able to capture. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11349.34s)]

*  at first is like the most interesting man in the world probably would like go [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11407.220000000001s)]
*  against his own thing that's interesting eventually. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11411.9s)]
*  The same reason why I like a cool comic that like once you start saying something [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11414.54s)]
*  and everyone's they're like say the line. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11418.14s)]
*  The interesting guy wouldn't do it anymore. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11419.7s)]
*  So that's the first thing you need to be able to program it to be like to [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11421.5s)]
*  understand like when to how to get off something that you're doing. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11424.34s)]
*  And then the right time is if it is doing that and figures out that formula of how [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11428.82s)]
*  to be a clever comedian. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11433.66s)]
*  Who's a human. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11435.82s)]
*  Who's it doing it to. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11436.7s)]
*  Because if we're gone it's going to do it to itself. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11438.619999999999s)]
*  Well maybe it just kills the guys and it does it to the girls because it gets [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11442.34s)]
*  programmed by dudes and then it kills off all the guys and then it's just doing [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11445.14s)]
*  like straight up pickup artists. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11448.26s)]
*  There's all these robots doing magic tricks with like wacky hats in Vegas [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11449.38s)]
*  essentially. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11452.9s)]
*  So that's a possibility. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11454.22s)]
*  I guess that's a possibility. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11456.539999999999s)]
*  But if you're optimizing but if you're just if if it becomes a version of an [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11459.02s)]
*  artificial version of a human being and it exists and it's autonomous and then [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11464.9s)]
*  we're not here anymore. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11471.02s)]
*  If we die off like what does it do. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11472.58s)]
*  That's the thing. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11475.46s)]
*  Like does it. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11475.98s)]
*  What is the most interesting and try. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11476.539999999999s)]
*  Does it continue to try to behave in any way shape or form in a way that human [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11478.98s)]
*  beings are interested in. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11484.06s)]
*  Or does it do something that's just completely technologically based with no [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11485.3s)]
*  emotions like does it completely abandon all the need for social interaction has [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11488.98s)]
*  it programmed into it. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11493.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11495.26s)]
*  Has it been programmed into it or is that just an essential part of what it means to [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11495.58s)]
*  be an artificial version of a person. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11499.900000000001s)]
*  I think we're we're we're so goddamn close to something completely new and unique [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11502.220000000001s)]
*  existing amongst us. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11508.62s)]
*  And I think this chat deep GPT shit is the beginning of that kind of thing. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11509.740000000002s)]
*  I think it's inevitable. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11513.18s)]
*  They're all storming the gates and work on these kind of really disruptive [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11514.5s)]
*  technologies. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11518.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11519.58s)]
*  So many of them that are working on simultaneously. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11519.740000000002s)]
*  Do you know what one as you're saying that like I feel like one of the biggest [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11522.66s)]
*  problems that probably will kind of present itself is like you know like the [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11525.98s)]
*  liberals have a prescription for you know how to live. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11530.66s)]
*  Yes. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11533.34s)]
*  Because I have a prescription for how to live. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11533.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11535.82s)]
*  Kind of one of the things that you know always like annoys me is like even you [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11536.1s)]
*  know like be a comedian or be a sex worker like a lot of these are like pirate life [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11540.98s)]
*  prescriptions for someone. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11545.7s)]
*  They might. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11547.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11547.58s)]
*  If you're that type of person but for most people they're probably the bad [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11547.86s)]
*  prescription. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11550.220000000001s)]
*  Most people would probably better off with like a normal life but people should [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11551.460000000001s)]
*  still be able to do a pirate life. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11554.460000000001s)]
*  So if you if you're if you kind of have computers if you're programming the [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11557.14s)]
*  optimal life you kind of are going to program out all the interesting stuff. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11561.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11566.02s)]

*  You're going to make you going to stop being a person. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11567.380000000001s)]
*  It's going to realize that being a person is totally unnecessary without [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11569.66s)]
*  biology. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11572.1s)]

*  person is all related to biology. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11577.34s)]
*  It's all related to life experiences. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11580.18s)]
*  It's related to how you cope with your environment. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11582.02s)]
*  It's all related to like character development. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11584.7s)]
*  It's all related to all these variables that the computer won't give a fuck [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11586.98s)]
*  about. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11589.82s)]
*  So it's like why are we hanging on to this jealousy thing. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11590.58s)]
*  Why do we still have this ego thing. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11593.1s)]
*  Let's just concentrate on making better forms of life and just continue to [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11594.74s)]
*  accelerate. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11599.9s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11601.9s)]
*  You're having these conversations and they're just like OK. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11602.14s)]
*  Well anyways. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11604.42s)]

*  So if AI became sentient and just said we're not going to kill you just no more [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11612.900000000001s)]
*  babies. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11617.26s)]

*  If it just completely took over everything and everybody just agreed to do it [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11620.78s)]
*  because it's better than being slaughtered and a few people would try to [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11623.820000000002s)]
*  probably commit suicide. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11626.86s)]
*  That was their peace offering like hey we're not going to torture you. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11627.740000000002s)]

*  Like we literally don't die. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11636.18s)]

*  Maybe even better. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11650.26s)]
*  Like they don't care. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11650.94s)]
*  It's like look we're just going to fix it. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11652.22s)]

*  What do you think they would do with dogs and stuff. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11713.22s)]
*  No we don't need them anymore. [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11715.3s)]
*  So they're gone immediately. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11716.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11718.22s)]
*  We do the same thing with them. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11718.619999999999s)]
*  Fix them all. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11719.619999999999s)]
*  Let them die off. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11720.34s)]
*  So when you start thinking about the world like this and it seems very possible. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11721.66s)]
*  Scary. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11725.060000000001s)]
*  You go. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11726.02s)]
*  It's so sketchy. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11726.58s)]
*  Yeah you do want to. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11727.9s)]
*  You're like you do. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11728.7s)]
*  That's when at the very least you're like all right let's like have some like let's get this stuff figured out a little better before we start putting it in my head by my brain. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11729.94s)]
*  Yeah let's try it out on dogs. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11739.5s)]
*  Let's see if you can get your dog to talk. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11741.300000000001s)]
*  People you know people are. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11743.9s)]
*  Scooby Doo dogs. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11745.82s)]
*  People are very fighty though. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11747.1s)]
*  You know especially America which is one of the things I like about here but it's like just even the vaccine stuff it's like whether you know whatever anyone thinks of it is like people you can't tell Americans what to do that good you know. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11749.78s)]
*  So I think that. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11762.86s)]
*  Well people are armed here. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11763.74s)]
*  That's part of the. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11765.74s)]
*  It's a huge part of it. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11766.58s)]
*  Part of the thing whether people want to agree to it or not. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11767.86s)]
*  There's this woman that she's some online lady in England who's a commentary lady and she was talking about the Second Amendment and she was talking about how in England there's this thing going on where they were breaking into people's homes. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11770.1s)]
*  The gas companies were breaking into people's homes when they weren't there to fix things and fuck around. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11783.34s)]
*  These people were furious that someone just broke into their home when they were not there and that they had access to their home because they work for the gas company and they're like this would never happen in the United States. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11788.9s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11798.22s)]
*  Second Amendment you can't just break into people's houses and it's true like when no one has guns and the government can just decide to break into your house like what are you going to do about it. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11798.900000000001s)]
*  They're the only people that have guns. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11808.26s)]
*  That is a crazy position while you're allowing cops to be in. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11809.62s)]
*  Yeah yeah it's not free to you know freedom is not free right. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11813.5s)]
*  Yeah but in America everyone has guns and everybody thinks that's a terrible idea. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11816.42s)]
*  Well it is a terrible idea if it goes terribly but it's almost always going to go terribly if the government's the only one with guns. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11821.34s)]
*  Yeah yeah I know you mean. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11831.5s)]
*  That's always going to go terribly. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11832.539999999999s)]
*  Well it's also depends on the you know like you there's other countries that have the luxury of America existing you know it's like they're not the world power. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11834.42s)]
*  You know like Canada is like you know you could say it goes terribly I mean I don't know maybe it goes terribly but they also aren't the world power right. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11843.46s)]
*  So if it goes terribly it's like another well another country if things went really crazy in like Mexico or Canada I think America would be like what the fuck are you guys doing over there. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11850.42s)]
*  All right we're taking this over or like something you know. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11859.02s)]
*  Do you think we would take over Mexico or Canada. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11861.220000000001s)]
*  No I think that Brian long did you secretly smoke some of my weed. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11863.220000000001s)]
*  If I what did you secretly smoke some of this weed. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11867.34s)]
*  No he's talking like a dude who smokes. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11869.5s)]
*  Maybe you got a contact tie. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11871.140000000001s)]
*  You might have got a contact tie. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11873.58s)]
*  All the alien do you think we would ever take over Canada or Mexico. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11875.380000000001s)]
*  There's no but I think that countries like Canada if they because they don't have guns right. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11880.060000000001s)]
*  But but they do have some they just don't have guns like we have it they don't have guns like we have in America. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11887.26s)]
*  And I think that the reason things probably don't get super out of control is because there's kind of like a big brother beside it. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11892.58s)]
*  Didn't they recently ban some type of guns in Canada. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11899.5s)]
*  Yeah and the sale of handguns. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11903.22s)]
*  Is that what it was. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11905.18s)]
*  I feel like there's something along those lines. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11907.78s)]
*  Canada bans all handgun sales in latest gun control move. [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11911.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11917.06s)]
*  Handgun sales. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11919.02s)]
*  It's just. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11924.7s)]
*  It's a very weird one. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11926.26s)]
*  It's a very weird one because if the government is the only one with guns that's not good. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11927.9s)]
*  It's not good when people have guns and they abuse it and they do horrible things. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11931.859999999999s)]
*  You're right. That's not good either. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11935.46s)]
*  So we're in this weird spot. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11937.259999999998s)]
*  We're like what's the answer. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11938.42s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is but I definitely know the answer does not begin with give the government your guns. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11940.179999999998s)]
*  They're the only one with guns now because the government is filled with people. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11946.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11949.46s)]
*  People that have that kind of power where they're the only ones with the guns. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11949.699999999999s)]
*  Those people can do some fucking Game of Thrones shit. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11953.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11956.099999999999s)]
*  That's what people always do. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11956.339999999998s)]
*  I mean there's so much that kind of relates to that even just you know how Canada where they were more locked down places they were more locked down. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11958.14s)]
*  Australia. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11965.9s)]
*  Yeah it's all kind of related. [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11966.66s)]
*  You know it's related. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11968.18s)]
*  It's also related to like what's their attitude about freedom and America's fucking freedom. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11969.02s)]
*  Like America. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11973.38s)]
*  Americans like instantaneously will say freedom like what's so great about America. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11974.78s)]
*  Freedom. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11979.22s)]
*  It's like it's in the ethos. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11980.58s)]
*  It is in the ethos. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11982.34s)]
*  That's not the case in some countries. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11983.5s)]
*  No. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11985.42s)]
*  You don't even hear about it. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11986.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11987.1s)]
*  They don't think about that. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11987.380000000001s)]
*  I mean religions like that in some places like when I grew up I didn't know religious people really. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11988.18s)]
*  That's interesting. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11992.62s)]
*  Now you moved to America like you know it's a big part of. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11993.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11995.62s)]
*  Not that say there weren't any in Canada but. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11995.86s)]
*  Well you ain't got freedom without the Lord son. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11997.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=11999.460000000001s)]
*  I feel like with freedom of speech to especially it's kind of it kind of reminds me of like sometimes this is why people on every side always like comedians when they're losing because comedians always. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12000.42s)]
*  Freedom of speech is like almost like a sexy issue in some ways. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12014.66s)]
*  But it reminds me of you know like if you take a basketball game and the cheerleaders like people like yeah we'd want to watch the cheerleaders. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12018.54s)]
*  That's cool. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12026.9s)]
*  But like if they were ever in if they were ever going to interfere with the actual game everyone be like all right. [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12027.82s)]
*  Give her the cheerleaders. [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12032.78s)]
*  I feel like that's how people feel about freedom of speech like it's sexy like yeah of course I have freedom of speech but like the minute it's actually getting in the way of things they want they're like all right. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12033.9s)]
*  Well like I don't actually care like. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12040.54s)]
*  That's the problem when people are short sighted because they're because they're short sighted they think that their ideology is the only ideology that is worthwhile. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12043.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbTDAvqr6U&t=12051.54s)]
