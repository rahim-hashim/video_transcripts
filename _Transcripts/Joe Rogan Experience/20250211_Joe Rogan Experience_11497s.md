*  What did you catch? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=38.44s)]
*  Well, I thought I had bronchitis. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=39.44s)]
*  Everybody in the house had it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=41.44s)]
*  We go to CrossFit and they all had it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=43.24s)]
*  I go to CrossFit Jackson. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=45.92s)]
*  My trainer is Megan Russell there and she's going, you know, you might want to take it [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=48.8s)]
*  easy a little bit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  Of course, I'm smoking cigarettes and I got bronchitis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=55.64s)]
*  I go to a clinic. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=59.96s)]
*  They give me some drugs. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=62.6s)]
*  Yeah, you got bronchitis. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=63.6s)]
*  Go home a couple days later. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=66.0s)]
*  I'm sleeping in my chair and my wife has one of those little oxygen modern things you put [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=68.4s)]
*  on your finger. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=72.36s)]
*  She wakes me up and goes, all right, let's go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=74.32s)]
*  What do you mean let's go? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=78.64s)]
*  Oxygen levels. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=80.6s)]
*  You go to the hospital. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=81.6s)]
*  What? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=84.6s)]
*  I'm just sitting here taking a nap. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=85.6s)]
*  No, you're going to the hospital. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=87.88s)]
*  So I said, OK. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=90.6s)]
*  So we get this late at night. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=91.88s)]
*  We go to St. Vincent's Clinic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=93.72s)]
*  Go in. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=96.88s)]
*  It's late. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=97.88s)]
*  And sitting there waiting for the doctor, Arion Afshari, great guy, it turns out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  He comes in and looking at me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  He's young enough to be one of my kids. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=111.8s)]
*  He goes, stethoscope, listen to my lungs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=114.96s)]
*  He goes, do you smoke? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=119.32s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=121.44s)]
*  He says, you need to quit. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=122.44s)]
*  I said, I just did. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  He goes, what? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  I said, I just did. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=129.04s)]
*  Now, what do we do? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=130.04s)]
*  He goes, well, next you're going to the hospital. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=132.4s)]
*  This is just a clinic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=135.92s)]
*  I said, what do you mean I'm going to the hospital? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=136.92s)]
*  He says, you haven't got bronchitis. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=139.72s)]
*  You got pneumonia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=141.32s)]
*  And I think you got double pneumonia. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=143.28s)]
*  So you're going right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=145.0s)]
*  What's double pneumonia? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=146.76s)]
*  Both lungs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=147.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=148.76s)]
*  The bad kind. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=149.76s)]
*  The bad kind. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=150.76s)]
*  He says, but the good news is you don't have bronchitis. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=152.72s)]
*  I said, OK. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=155.68s)]
*  I guess that's good news. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=156.68s)]
*  And that was about the time I was supposed to be in the studio with you, just a couple [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=158.56s)]
*  days before that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=163.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=164.68s)]
*  And I'm going, wow, this kind of screw up my plans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=165.68s)]
*  As you know, best made plans and all that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Listen, the plans are all bullshit. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=171.84s)]
*  We made those up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=173.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=174.28s)]
*  We'll do it at the end of the year. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=175.28s)]
*  It doesn't have to be that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=176.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=177.28s)]
*  Well, thanks for the invite. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=178.28s)]
*  I look forward to it this year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=179.28s)]
*  I'm just happy that you're OK. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=180.28s)]
*  I am OK. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  The date didn't matter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Things happen. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=184.56s)]
*  I'm just glad you recovered. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=185.56s)]
*  I'm glad you quit smoking too. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=186.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=188.24s)]
*  He says, you need to quit smoking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=189.24s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=190.24s)]
*  Went to the hospital. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=191.24s)]
*  Was in there for almost five days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=192.24s)]
*  And I haven't been in a hospital in a while, but they have it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=193.6s)]
*  St. Vincent's did a great job. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=197.64s)]
*  The nurses have their little machines they wheel around, and they come in your room every [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=199.2s)]
*  – it seemed like quite often to check your vitals, to do this, to do intravenous, to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=203.04s)]
*  do that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  So I'm sitting in there and couldn't sleep. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  So I'm one of those guys that if you walk by the door and you see an old guy sitting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  on a bed looking out the door, that's me. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  So I maybe got an hour, two hours of sleep at night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Did you have a hard time kicking the cigarettes? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Because you've been smoking like your whole life, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=225.64s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=227.64s)]
*  I've been smoking for over 50 years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And I know it's bad for me, and I've never been an anti-smoking crusader, but if anything [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=231.16s)]
*  good comes to my appearance with you today, it was that this Dr. Afshari, total stranger, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=237.88s)]
*  guy I never met before in my life, happened to tell me at the right exact time, you need [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=243.88s)]
*  to quit. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=250.48s)]
*  And I've been thinking I need to quit for a long time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=252.32s)]
*  My loved ones told me that, my wife, my kids. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  I never. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=258.2s)]
*  Okay, that's a good idea. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=259.2s)]
*  It's a weird thing because it kills you slowly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=260.2s)]
*  And along the way, it gives you just a little bit of happiness. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=262.2s)]
*  A little bit of happiness while it kills you slowly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=265.36s)]
*  And it's not just a problem of killing you slowly, it's how it's going to kill you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  The way it's going to kill you, it's going to suffocate you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  I have a friend, my friend Mike, who owns the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  And he was trying to convince a friend of mine to quit smoking because his wife is a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=281.8s)]
*  nurse. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  I gave him that at school, but he was explaining that the way people die of lung cancer, the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=287.64s)]
*  way people die at the end. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=293.11999999999995s)]
*  And he's like, it's horrible. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=294.4s)]
*  You don't see that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  You just hear he died of cancer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  You don't see what the final days are like. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=299.84s)]
*  And it's avoidable. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=302.0s)]
*  It's avoidable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, since I quit, I don't cough anymore. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=304.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=307.76s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=308.76s)]
*  I can breathe better. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=309.76s)]
*  And I'm still getting better from the pneumonia. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  It takes a while to get over that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=317.88s)]
*  I was amazed that you could still fly so quickly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=319.24s)]
*  We drove. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=322.28s)]
*  You drove from Alaska? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=323.28s)]
*  No, from Florida. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Florida in the West. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  We were in Florida. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  How long did that take though? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  That's a couple days. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  It was a couple days. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, we had stuff we didn't want to put on the airlines. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=335.52s)]
*  Wink. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=336.52s)]
*  Government. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=337.52s)]
*  I'm just teasing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=338.52s)]
*  We wanted a road trip. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=340.28s)]
*  We wanted a little adventure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=342.84s)]
*  You fly over this country at 45,000 feet and you're looking out the window. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=345.32s)]
*  It's a big country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=348.52s)]
*  It happens in two hours. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=349.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=352.32s)]
*  And you're looking out and you suddenly see a little dot and see some houses. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=353.32s)]
*  I wonder what those people do down there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=356.96s)]
*  That's a real problem with people who don't venture outside of the bubbles. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=358.8s)]
*  If they're in those left-wing liberal bubbles like New York and California, the people that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=362.32s)]
*  don't travel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=366.52s)]
*  What helped me a lot is doing stand-up on the road. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=367.52s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=369.68s)]
*  Because I was everywhere. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=370.68s)]
*  So I would go to all these different towns all over the country. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=371.96s)]
*  You get to see a whole different group of people, a whole different kind of people. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=375.2s)]
*  It's like people are the same and different everywhere you go. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=379.08s)]
*  And this idea that the people in the middle are stupid, especially now, that's a really [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  dumb way to look at it because of the internet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=386.52s)]
*  Now everybody kind of has access to information. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  And you're going to have dumb people and you're going to have smart people no matter where [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  you go, including in the cities. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=394.2s)]
*  But the problem in the cities is the dumb people can trick you because they believe [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=396.0s)]
*  the things that the smart people believe. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=398.84s)]
*  And they say them loudly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=400.35999999999996s)]
*  And so they think they're smart. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  So this is a way to be smart without actually being smart. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  Just say the things that smart people say and say it like you're defending it and you're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=405.96s)]
*  defending freedom or science or some shit, democracy, whatever it is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=409.23999999999995s)]
*  Just yell it out. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=413.08s)]
*  And then the smart people won't say anything because you're saying the things that they [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=414.28s)]
*  want to say. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  And the other people are like, hey, I know what you're doing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=419.64s)]
*  And more than anything, it turns people off. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=422.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=426.32s)]
*  By traveling, you have a chance at having an adventure. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=428.4s)]
*  Something cool could happen. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=432.96s)]
*  Yeah, you run into interesting characters. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=433.96s)]
*  All right, it's February. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  And by now, 80% of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=438.52s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=442.76s)]
*  Life can get crazy and all of a sudden you don't have the time. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=443.76s)]
*  But one easy habit to stick with is AG1. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=446.88s)]
*  It's an easy, realistic habit that you can make to benefit your whole body health. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=450.28s)]
*  AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients, easy to get and replaces multiple vitamins and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=455.84s)]
*  supplements with just one scoop. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=460.11999999999995s)]
*  You just mix it in some cold water, take a nice moment in the morning to do your body [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=461.88s)]
*  right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=465.84s)]
*  And honestly, it tastes pretty good. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=466.84s)]
*  It's not easy to pack this many high quality ingredients with this much nutrient density. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  But AG1 makes it happen without added sugars or artificial sweeteners ever. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  AG1 is a great way to invest in your health now and in the long run, which is why I've [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=478.76s)]
*  partnered with them for so long. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=483.32s)]
*  Try AG1 and get a free bottle of vitamin D3, K2 and five free AG1 travel packs with your [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=484.88s)]

*  Check it out. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  Regular humans just live in different lives. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=504.74s)]
*  They're all over the place and they're all unique. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=507.52s)]
*  That's the cool thing about this country. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  If you really did have the time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=510.84s)]
*  That's what I loved about Anthony Bourdain's show, especially the first one that he had. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=511.84s)]
*  You go to these like little hot dog stands in New Jersey and just you just hang out with [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=516.0s)]
*  people and street food and you know, you just get a just a bigger picture of humans in life. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=521.04s)]
*  When we got to I forget Texas, there was a place called Buc-E's. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=528.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=534.64s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=535.64s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=536.64s)]
*  First time you go there, you're like, what the hell is this place? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=537.64s)]
*  200 gas pumps. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=542.0s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=543.0s)]
*  We paid a buck forty seven a gallon. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=544.0s)]
*  That's three times what or three times less than what I pay in Alaska. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=547.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=551.32s)]
*  Alaska's got to be rough, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=552.32s)]
*  But meanwhile, that's where they get the oil. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=553.32s)]
*  Isn't the oil like real close to there? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  Runs right through my property. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=556.48s)]
*  I helped build that some bitch. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=557.48s)]
*  So anyways, you know, I've never understood the economics of how that works. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=560.48s)]
*  California's the worst. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=566.08s)]
*  I believe the way we tried to figure this out the other day. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=567.08s)]
*  I don't think we got to the bottom of it, though. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=569.0799999999999s)]
*  I think California has to use gasoline that's refined in California. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=570.88s)]
*  So it's one of the reasons why. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=576.04s)]
*  And then I'm sure crazy fucking carbon taxes, whatever. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=577.88s)]
*  They did the ramp up some extra shit to make it more expensive because you're looking at [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  a price per gallon. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=586.52s)]
*  That's like a couple of bucks more a gallon always than it is here. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=587.76s)]
*  As soon as we came here, I was like, what happened to gas? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=591.04s)]
*  Why is it so less here? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  You get a little plastic bottle of water, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=596.08s)]
*  Twelve ounces. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=599.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=600.08s)]
*  You look at that bottle, you'll pay two bucks for it in a 7-Eleven, you know, for that little [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=602.08s)]
*  bottle of water. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  Four of those bottles of water make a gallon. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  You're paying eight bucks a gallon for water. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  Water is the most abundant thing on the planet. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=613.88s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=616.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=617.64s)]
*  Except in some parts of California, apparently they didn't want to have the reservoirs filled up. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=618.64s)]
*  Well, they had to put a lid on it, John. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=624.08s)]
*  There's a lid and the lid was broken. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=626.08s)]
*  Remember, we talked about that 60-foot diameter water line coming down from Southeast Alaska [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=628.48s)]
*  to California? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  That would have been helpful. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  If they can do that with oil, why can't they do that with water? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=640.12s)]
*  Because they're afraid there'd be a water leak in the Pacific Ocean. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  You can't have water. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can't drown the ocean. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=647.6s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=648.6s)]
*  Oh, so anyway, so you're looking at eight bucks a gallon for water. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=649.6s)]
*  But oil, you got to go find it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  Then you got to do all kinds of seismic work. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=656.92s)]
*  Then you got to drill and then you got to discover it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=658.84s)]
*  Then you got to build a well and then you got to build feeder lines. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=660.92s)]
*  Then you got to get it to a pump station. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=664.04s)]
*  Then you got to get it somewhere in a pipeline. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=665.72s)]
*  Then you got to ship it 4,000 miles. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=668.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you got to use it to ship it, which is even crazy. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=670.04s)]
*  And you're paying a buck 47 a gallon. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=673.8s)]
*  How's this working, boys? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=677.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=679.2s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=680.2s)]
*  And how much do you have? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=681.2s)]
*  How are we burning so much and still there? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=682.76s)]
*  How much is there? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=685.1600000000001s)]
*  How much do you guys have left? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  They got a bunch in Alaska. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=687.4000000000001s)]
*  They got a bunch everywhere. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=689.72s)]
*  I bet they got a bunch in Greenland, too. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=690.72s)]
*  There is a book that I read, a book that I read, I think in the 90s called Black Gold [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=693.12s)]
*  Stranglehold, maybe early 2000s. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=697.6400000000001s)]
*  And I never found out if it was real or not. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=700.24s)]
*  I never looked into it any further. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=702.5200000000001s)]
*  I need to talk to like an expert. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=704.08s)]
*  But this guy was essentially saying that oil is a natural property of Earth and that it's [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  not like dinosaur fossils like we like to think about it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=709.96s)]
*  Fossil fuels, dinosaurs and plants break down. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=715.2s)]
*  They make oil. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=717.64s)]
*  He said oil is a natural component of Earth and that the proof is in the fact that if [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=718.64s)]
*  they have these wells that go dry, they can wait just a little while and then they could [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=724.52s)]
*  go back to the well again and it'll replenish itself. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=729.76s)]
*  How is that possible if this is just decaying matter over millions and millions of years? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=734.68s)]
*  It doesn't make sense unless it's coming, seeping in from other areas that they don't [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=738.6s)]
*  have access to and it somehow or another gets to that well. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=743.84s)]
*  Like it's all like a stream underground, which begs the question, like, how much is there? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=746.24s)]
*  They found out that there's three times more water in the ground, underground, than there [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=751.76s)]
*  is in all the oceans of Earth. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=756.64s)]
*  Some crazy stuff, dude. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=761.36s)]
*  Crazy stuff. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=762.36s)]
*  That I didn't even make sense because they said the water's trapped. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=764.24s)]
*  I think they're saying the water's trapped in rocks. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=766.64s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=768.84s)]
*  See if you can find that article. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=772.4s)]
*  It said three times as much water under the ground as the ocean. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  How? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=778.2s)]
*  Three times? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=780.6s)]
*  It's stored within a mineral called ringwoodite. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=781.6s)]
*  Ringwoodite. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=784.32s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=785.32s)]
*  Does it have a picture? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=787.32s)]
*  Like some fucking avatar mineral, some glowing blue mineral filled with water. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=790.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=796.36s)]
*  Oh shit, that's crazy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=797.36s)]
*  I called it magnesium silicate. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=799.4s)]
*  Wow, it's beautiful. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=802.6s)]
*  Show me an image of that shit. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=805.0s)]
*  Key points about it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=808.24s)]
*  The hidden oceans found under hundreds of miles below the Earth's surface in the transition [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=809.24s)]
*  zone between the upper and lower mantle. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=812.76s)]
*  The water is trapped within the crystal structure of the mineral ringwoodite. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=816.04s)]
*  Significance, this discovery could significantly alter our understanding of the Earth's water [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=820.08s)]
*  cycle and potentially provide insights into the origin of water on our planet. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=823.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank God there's scientists out there. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  Except of course the cocksuckers that fucking steal your bones won't give them back. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  Fuck those guys. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=837.12s)]
*  But other scientists like these cool guys that figured this out, these cool guys, gals [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=838.12s)]
*  and non-binary folk. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=842.16s)]
*  That is wild stuff, man. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=845.04s)]
*  Three times as much ocean as in the ocean. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=846.96s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=849.76s)]
*  So that's the transition zone. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=851.64s)]
*  It's all hydrated. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=852.88s)]
*  How long before like rappers start wearing that around a necklace? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=855.84s)]
*  That seems like a dope necklace. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=859.4s)]
*  That's that shit that they make water out of. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=861.92s)]
*  It's got to sell it to someone. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=864.48s)]
*  Yeah, you just need some Kendrick Lamar type influencer. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=867.36s)]
*  Someone was at the top of his game to start wearing it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=871.16s)]
*  You know, like Kanye and his prime, he could have got that out there. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  By the way, I want to thank you for your podcast and the one with President Trump. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=878.64s)]
*  Oh, you're welcome. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=886.56s)]
*  I thought that was great. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=887.56s)]
*  And I made the mistake of complimenting you on that page. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=889.24s)]
*  I said, I really enjoyed the podcast between you and President Trump. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=893.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ, 8,000 people coming at me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=899.12s)]

*  On my page. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=910.8s)]
*  Yeah, you got to stop reading the comments. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=911.8s)]
*  I know a great man once told me that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=913.48s)]
*  The problem is I don't take advice and I don't give advice. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=915.4s)]
*  But I'm trying. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=918.32s)]
*  I don't give a whole lot of advice. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=920.0s)]
*  I guess I do sometimes, but only with really important stuff. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=921.48s)]
*  Like that's an important one. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=924.96s)]
*  You can't fix those and they will affect the way you think. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=926.28s)]
*  They affect the way people behave. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=929.44s)]
*  They affect your freedom of expression to freely express yourself. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=931.72s)]
*  I think it had a great impact on the election. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=935.8s)]
*  I think it had an impact. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=938.72s)]
*  It showed Mr. Trump as a regular guy. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  As a human. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it humanized him. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=945.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, he also was right about a lot of shit. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  The fact that he called the problem with the LA fires months before they happened was literally [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=949.6s)]
*  saying what they needed to do, what they're doing wrong, and then boom, two times the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=954.88s)]
*  size of Manhattan is gone. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=959.88s)]
*  It's so crazy when you see it live or, excuse me, from above, like on video, when they do [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=962.8399999999999s)]
*  the drone sweeps over it, fucking like a bomb went off, like a fucking nuclear bomb hit [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=967.68s)]
*  that part of the state. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=973.88s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=975.92s)]
*  Well, maybe they can rebuild it after rebuild Hawaii and North Carolina and take care of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=976.92s)]
*  some of those guys. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=982.0s)]
*  They're still working on shit that's blown over in Florida, right? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=983.0s)]
*  We saw a lot of it in Georgia when we went through. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=986.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=989.3199999999999s)]
*  There's you're always going to have a certain amount of hurricane damage. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=990.84s)]
*  But if we don't take care of that first and instead we spend $200 million on transgender [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=994.2800000000001s)]
*  animal studies, like what the fuck? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1000.3000000000001s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1003.0200000000001s)]
*  Like why aren't we allocating money to the most important things we have, which is people [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1004.0200000000001s)]
*  and their safety and their homes and to be able to rebuild the fact that they get a $770 [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1009.88s)]
*  check and that's it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1016.12s)]
*  That's all those people in Maui got. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  That's just to let you know, like this is a fucking rigged game. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1019.6s)]
*  So even if you're not happy with what Elon Musk is doing and he has access that he shouldn't [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  have and all this different stuff, you got to rip the bandaid off kids. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1028.56s)]
*  This country is trillions of dollars, $36 trillion in debt and a lot of the stuff that's [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1033.96s)]
*  listed on USAID, all this stuff that's coming out, all these different things that they [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1039.84s)]
*  paid for, they're so frivolous and so fucking insane. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1043.84s)]
*  It wouldn't be too crazy, it wouldn't be as crazy if we were at A, $36 trillion in debt [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1048.8s)]
*  and B, not taking care of people in Maui, North Carolina. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1054.44s)]

*  Because the solution is you bring everybody over here, they commit crimes, you have chaos, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1295.9399999999998s)]

*  The right way to do it is take what we have in America, the freedom and the ability to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1314.38s)]
*  prosper and expand that throughout the world. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1321.98s)]

*  By the way, gold's gone up a thousand and ounces. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1442.4199999999998s)]
*  I saw you last. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1444.3799999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1445.3799999999999s)]
*  A thousand dollars an ounce? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1446.66s)]
*  It's three thousand bucks an ounce. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1448.2600000000002s)]
*  Didn't they find a gang of it in China recently? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1449.66s)]
*  Oh, they probably got all kinds of it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1451.7s)]
*  I think China just didn't they? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1453.7s)]
*  China just found some crazy new discovery of an enormous amount of gold. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1455.3000000000002s)]
*  They're talking about back then a crypto coin with gold. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1461.74s)]
*  It's better than money. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1464.22s)]
*  It's real. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1466.98s)]
*  But my son is a. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1467.98s)]
*  When are you going to get a Boneyard crypto coin? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1468.98s)]
*  Twenty twenty four November, China discovered a large gold deposit in the Wangu Goldfield [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1473.54s)]
*  in the Hunan province. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1479.5s)]
*  The discovery is estimated to be worth eighty three billion dollars, making it one of the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1480.94s)]
*  largest gold finds in history. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1486.34s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1488.46s)]
*  The deposit is estimated to contain over one thousand metric tons of gold. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1490.62s)]
*  Gold is located in 40 veins that extend up to three thousand meters underground. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1495.62s)]
*  The discovery is made using advanced 3D geological modeling. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1499.7s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1504.1000000000001s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1506.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you're a gold miner. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1507.3000000000002s)]
*  Tell me, like, how do you know where to dig? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1508.7s)]
*  How do you guys find that stuff? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1510.98s)]
*  It's real simple. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1512.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1513.26s)]
*  Gold's where you find it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1514.26s)]
*  Well, that's the bottom line, Joe. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1515.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1517.7s)]
*  And but once you make a discovery, let's use low gold, which is still in the rock. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1518.7s)]
*  Plaster gold. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1523.38s)]
*  What we do is then eroded out of the rock and is in the concentrates on bedrock. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1524.38s)]
*  And you got to wash it and sift it and sluice it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1528.18s)]
*  But low gold, you got to crush to get the gold out of the rock. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1531.7s)]
*  And so from the moment of discovery until you produce it out of that gold mine, it takes [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1536.9s)]
*  average twenty nine years. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1543.7s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1545.5s)]
*  Twenty nine years to go from finding it to having an operating gold mine for copper mine [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1546.5s)]
*  or lead mine or silver mine or zinc mine. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1552.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1555.3400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1557.78s)]
*  What's really interesting, too, in this country is the story of the gold miners like the San [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  Francisco forty niners, the people that came across the country when they found out that [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1565.1399999999999s)]
*  they had struck gold. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1570.46s)]
*  And that must have been a really wild time, a fucking dangerous time, too, because you [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1571.46s)]
*  have the lawless West and then you have a bunch of people who are just desperadoes who [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1576.8999999999999s)]
*  are pulling gold out of the ground. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1581.82s)]
*  That guy might have pulled enough gold out of the ground to literally pay for the rest [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1584.26s)]
*  of your life. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1588.8s)]
*  And he's right there and no one's around. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1589.8s)]
*  I know a couple of guys you couldn't tell they could rub two sticks together. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1592.66s)]
*  Good friend of mine bought a bank because the bank had a big vault. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1596.82s)]
*  He had three tons of gold that he was he was like a collector, a hoarder. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1604.54s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1609.62s)]
*  He'd been mining for 40 years. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1610.62s)]
*  What is three tons of gold worth? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1612.9s)]
*  A lot. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1614.06s)]
*  What is that worth, Jamie? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1615.06s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1617.3400000000001s)]
*  Let's guess. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1618.3400000000001s)]
*  Take a guess. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1619.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm so dumb. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1620.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what that mean. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1621.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, three tons of gold. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1622.3400000000001s)]
*  You got to remember, there's a difference between if I was to ask you what weighs more, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1623.3400000000001s)]
*  a pound of feathers or a pound of gold? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1627.3400000000001s)]
*  What would you tell me? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1629.18s)]
*  A pound is a pound. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1630.18s)]
*  You'd be wrong because there's 16 ounces in a pound of feathers and there's 12 ounces, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1632.38s)]
*  different ounces in a pound of gold. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1638.9s)]
*  How come? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1640.66s)]
*  Just the way it is. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1641.8600000000001s)]
*  So when you buy a pound of gold, you're not getting 16 ounces. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1643.42s)]
*  You're getting 12, 12 troy ounces. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1646.66s)]
*  What nationality invented that? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1650.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to go full Kanye here. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1652.3400000000001s)]
*  The value of three tons of gold depends on the current market value of gold, which is [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1657.14s)]
*  constantly changing. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1661.18s)]
*  As of now, 2023, one ton of pure 24 karat gold was worth about 55 million. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1668.3000000000002s)]
*  This dude had three tons of gold. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1670.06s)]
*  He had $160 million. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1672.06s)]
*  $165 million in gold just laying around. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1676.06s)]
*  That's what him and his wife did. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1679.4599999999998s)]
*  That was what they did. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1681.02s)]
*  That is so nuts. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1682.5s)]
*  So this was just pure gold that he had made into ingots? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1683.78s)]
*  It's plaster gold. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1687.06s)]
*  It's the kind that we have. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1688.06s)]
*  He was on my ground and he would melt it and refine it if he wanted to get 24 karat. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1689.1799999999998s)]
*  It generally runs about 85% pure in its form on my creeks. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1695.26s)]
*  So if you find a one ounce nugget, 85% of that's probably 24 karat. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1700.18s)]
*  What's the biggest nugget you've ever found? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1704.66s)]
*  33 ounces. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1707.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1708.06s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1709.06s)]
*  Looks like a whale actually. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1712.1s)]
*  How big is it? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1713.54s)]
*  Like in your hand? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1715.02s)]
*  I got a picture of it on my page. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1716.02s)]
*  My daughter's holding it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1717.42s)]
*  Like an old school flip phone? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1718.5s)]
*  About that big? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1720.42s)]
*  It's almost this big. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1722.42s)]
*  Almost as big as a cell phone? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1723.7s)]
*  Like an iPhone? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1724.7s)]

*  Almost? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1726.7s)]
*  Like half of it? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1727.7s)]
*  Nineth, seven eighths. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1728.7s)]

*  Damn. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1732.7s)]
*  If you hold it one way it looks like a whale. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1733.7s)]
*  You flip it over it looks like a dolphin. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1734.7s)]
*  And now how much is a piece of gold like that worth right now? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1736.3400000000001s)]
*  Well because it looks like something. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1739.02s)]
*  It's called character. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1740.82s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1741.82s)]
*  So if you have a nugget that looks like a whale or a dolphin, it generally goes for [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1742.82s)]
*  four or five times world market. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1747.7s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1749.74s)]
*  If your goal is $3,000 an ounce that would be $12,000 to $15,000 for that character that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1750.78s)]
*  you're buying. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1756.78s)]

*  Yeah you got to find one that looks like a skull. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1774.18s)]
*  Oh you find a skull. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1776.26s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1777.26s)]
*  Oh they'll be knocking your door. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1778.26s)]
*  Oh the real nutty ones. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1779.78s)]
*  They'll be looking for the dude. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1781.42s)]
*  The rich occultists would want it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1782.7s)]
*  Part of their collection. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1784.78s)]
*  Every little nugget has some kind of, or bigger nugget has some kind of character that you [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1786.54s)]
*  keep looking for. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1790.86s)]
*  Like what's this look like? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1791.86s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1793.02s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1794.02s)]
*  Did you study the history of gold mining in this country before you got involved? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1795.02s)]
*  Not really. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1799.54s)]
*  No? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1800.54s)]
*  No. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1801.54s)]
*  I've been gold mining and I knew how to do it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1802.54s)]
*  I wasn't worth that shit but I'm getting better at it. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1804.66s)]
*  But it's a crazy way to make a living. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1810.06s)]
*  You're pulling the most precious thing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1813.94s)]
*  The thing that's probably, other than diamonds, which is kind of manufactured, there's probably [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1816.1000000000001s)]
*  a lot more diamonds than the value suggests. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1820.58s)]
*  Don't they hoard them up so that it keeps the price high? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1824.18s)]
*  They do that, right? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1828.26s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1829.26s)]
*  Yeah, De Beers controls the world. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1830.26s)]
*  What nationality does that? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1831.26s)]
*  De Beers. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1832.26s)]
*  But you bring up an interesting point. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1834.06s)]
*  The history of gold mining. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1837.74s)]
*  People don't even know how entrenched in our everyday lingo gold mining terms are. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1839.7s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1845.82s)]
*  Struck it rich? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1847.34s)]
*  Struck it rich. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1848.34s)]
*  Oh, he hit the mother lode. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1849.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1851.42s)]
*  He doesn't know the difference between shit and shinola. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1852.42s)]
*  Oh, what's that? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1855.54s)]
*  Shit and shinola is gold. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1857.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1858.86s)]
*  You can't tell the difference between shit and shinola. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1859.86s)]
*  I thought it was like poop versus shoe polish. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1862.26s)]
*  Shinola is gold. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1867.22s)]
*  Isn't shinola a shoe polish? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1868.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1869.9s)]
*  I never had a pair of shoes that had shinola. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1870.9s)]
*  I think shinola is a shoe polish. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1872.14s)]
*  Jamie, don't turn it on. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1874.54s)]
*  I'm just getting, I'm 90% sure shinola is a shoe polish, but I don't know which one came [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1876.3799999999999s)]
*  first. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1881.18s)]
*  Like shinola might have come after the gold term. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1882.18s)]
*  You know, it might be a recent corporation. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1884.42s)]
*  Could be. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1885.94s)]
*  But I think shinola is like an old school one. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1886.94s)]
*  I mean, maybe I'm having a fake memory, but I kind of remember of it in high school, like [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1890.3s)]
*  shoe polish. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1894.94s)]
*  But after today, now you know it's gold. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1896.12s)]
*  Now well, in gold rush terms, gold. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1899.22s)]
*  Like every culture has its own little lingo. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1903.86s)]
*  Is it a shoe polish, Jamie? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1906.86s)]
*  It is? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1908.82s)]
*  How long has it been around? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1909.82s)]
*  They could have stole that from gold. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1912.82s)]
*  Going bust. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1915.5s)]
*  Going bust. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1916.5s)]
*  I thought that was a gambling term. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1917.7s)]
*  I thought that was a, but it could be both, right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1919.7s)]
*  Probably. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1925.18s)]
*  I mean, it's those kind of things that are in our language, like pay dirt. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1926.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1930.22s)]
*  You hit pay dirt. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1931.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1933.22s)]
*  You hit gold in the dirt. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1934.22s)]
*  The way I've heard shit in shinola was shits. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1937.3s)]
*  Shits. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1940.42s)]
*  Shits. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1941.42s)]
*  Bedrock shist. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1944.42s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1945.42s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1946.42s)]
*  Shit in shinola. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1948.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1949.3400000000001s)]
*  Shits. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1950.3400000000001s)]
*  My gold is found in shits. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1951.3400000000001s)]
*  That actually makes more sense than shit in shinola. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1953.22s)]
*  You can't tell the difference between shit and shoe polish. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1955.14s)]
*  Don't you smell it? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1958.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1959.66s)]
*  I ain't never seen a shoe with shoe polish. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1960.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1963.54s)]
*  You've never seen a shoe with shoe polish? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1964.54s)]
*  I actually had to wear them in high school. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1965.54s)]
*  My parents put me in a reform school. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1968.64s)]

*  I wear polished shoes. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=1972.3400000000001s)]

*  I gave him a hug, talked to him. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2016.42s)]
*  He was very friendly. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2018.22s)]
*  I don't like that he said no. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2019.94s)]
*  He's going to vote no on Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2021.8600000000001s)]

*  I don't know how this works, man. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2031.5s)]
*  I'm confused about this whole process. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2033.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm confused about what's legal, what's not legal, what you can and can't do, what these [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2035.4199999999998s)]
*  executive orders can and can't do. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2039.86s)]
*  I'm confused how they closed the problem at the border down in three days. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2041.26s)]
*  They just basically completely put a stop to all the illegal coming in, except for like [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2046.02s)]
*  a hundred people a day. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2050.46s)]
*  It was thousands a day. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2051.9s)]
*  It was just an overrun of people coming through every day. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2053.18s)]
*  And they stopped it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2057.3399999999997s)]
*  And he said you couldn't stop it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2058.3399999999997s)]

*  from coming in. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2064.6600000000003s)]
*  All this stuff seems so common sense. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2065.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just amazing to me that people don't look at that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2068.82s)]
*  No one is going to trust you if all you talk about is the bad side from the other side. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2072.62s)]
*  If you don't say this is good, this is good for all of us. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2078.58s)]
*  If you don't say that, if you don't acknowledge, are you rooting against America? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2082.34s)]
*  Because like when good things happen, do you not want them to happen because a Republican [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2087.06s)]
*  is president? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2090.38s)]
*  Because that's a very un-American way to look at things. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2091.38s)]
*  And I think that's where we're at these days. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2094.1s)]
*  I think there's a giant chunk of our population that is so wrapped up in these social media [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2096.3s)]
*  squabbles and owning people online and talking shit and listening to videos and TikToks. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2101.14s)]
*  They're so wrapped up in this us versus them shit that they can't see that we're supposed [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2105.86s)]
*  to all be in this together. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2110.02s)]
*  And even if you don't like that guy, if Trump gets in and he does something that's awesome [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2111.3s)]
*  for the country, you should say that's awesome for the country. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2115.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's really good that terrorists aren't sneaking into our southern border. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2117.98s)]
*  That's really good. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2121.82s)]
*  It's really good that they find all the fucking criminals that are taking over apartment buildings [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2122.82s)]
*  in Aurora, Colorado and root them out. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2127.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's really good. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2129.6600000000003s)]
*  They should deport them. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2130.6600000000003s)]

*  That shouldn't, we shouldn't have to deal with that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2132.98s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we should fix everything that's going on in North Carolina. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2135.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's good for everybody. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2137.9s)]
*  It's like these things are common sense. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2139.9s)]
*  That's because it's gotten so bad now that the only reason to run for politics used to [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2143.18s)]
*  be to make the money, not just get reelected. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2148.18s)]
*  But it's the first thing they try to do when they get elected is start getting reelected. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  They're making so much money. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2155.66s)]
*  Oh, look at the money. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2156.66s)]
*  When you look at the amount of money some of those congresspeople are worth and you're [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  like, you tell me how you tell me how you make $180,000 a year and you were 30 million. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2162.3799999999997s)]
*  You tell me how you tell me how there's I can't find a way that makes any sense because [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2171.38s)]
*  you should be really busy. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2177.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2179.26s)]
*  So if you should be really busy doing this $180,000 a year job, you're who has time to [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2180.26s)]
*  have a side hustle that pays you 10 times more. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2186.06s)]
*  Who has time? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2191.06s)]
*  Who's doing that? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2192.54s)]
*  It's that's the only reason I can think of that people would want to get into that game. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2193.54s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of people like being the boss. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2199.42s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2202.02s)]
*  And a lot of people just want to be that person. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2203.02s)]
*  And when you're in a competition, right, a hierarchy based status competition, like the [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2206.54s)]
*  president of the United States, like everybody wants to be in that spot where everybody calls [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2211.94s)]
*  you sir and everybody shakes your hand and foreign leaders when you want to feel important. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2216.22s)]
*  They all do. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2220.44s)]
*  They can pretend they don't. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2221.44s)]
*  They all like it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2222.62s)]
*  That's why they do it. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2223.62s)]
*  Otherwise, they wouldn't want their whole life exposed like that and dig it into your [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2224.62s)]
*  past and distortions of your character and outright lies, anything to destroy you all [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2227.74s)]
*  over television because they're trying to win an election. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2232.14s)]
*  If they weren't the person that wants that spot, they wouldn't do it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2234.3599999999997s)]
*  That's why we don't get good leaders. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2238.18s)]
*  We don't get we don't get people who you would like really want to do it other than Trump. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2239.9399999999996s)]
*  And with that guy, it's like he's kind of a psycho. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2245.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't need the money. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2248.7s)]
*  He's not doing it for the money. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2250.58s)]
*  Well, I'm sure it helps that you can make money doing it, you know, not from the salary, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2251.58s)]
*  but from a lot of other stuff. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2256.58s)]
*  Like it elevates his his social profile for sure and makes him more popular, which is [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2257.9s)]
*  part of the brand of Donald Trump. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2264.3s)]
*  But like, didn't he famously not even get a paycheck? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2267.06s)]
*  Yeah, he donates his check to some organization. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2269.46s)]
*  That's fucking amazing. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2272.7799999999997s)]
*  And then this other thing about Elon, he's going to steal everybody's money. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2273.86s)]
*  He has 400 billion dollars. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2276.82s)]
*  I'm telling you, he's not going to steal your money. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2279.38s)]
*  I'm telling you, that's not what he's doing. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2281.46s)]
*  What he's doing is he's a super genius that's been fucked with. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2283.1s)]
*  OK. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2287.46s)]
*  And when you've been fucked with by these nitwits that hide behind three letter agencies [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2288.46s)]
*  and you're dealing with one of the smartest people alive and he helps Donald Trump get [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2292.98s)]
*  into office and he goes, I want to find out what kind of corruption is really around. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2296.14s)]
*  Well you fucked up. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2301.1s)]

*  That's good for everybody. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2310.98s)]
*  How you should be looking at this. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2312.58s)]
*  Like, wow, we have a brilliant mind that is examining these really fucking corrupt and [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2314.06s)]

*  Real ones? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2565.94s)]
*  Yeah, we could. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2566.94s)]
*  One penny weight coins. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2567.94s)]
*  One penny weighs an ounce. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2569.62s)]
*  And there's an opening right now because Trump just banned the penny. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2570.62s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2574.02s)]
*  Each one of those pennies worth about six cents. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2575.34s)]
*  Two cents. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2577.18s)]
*  It costs us two cents to make it. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2578.18s)]
*  To make it, yeah, but the copper itself. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2579.18s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2580.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, you got to mine it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2581.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2583.42s)]
*  So each penny is worth six cents. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2584.42s)]
*  I'm going to say five cents. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2587.18s)]
*  Because he added two cents to it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2588.34s)]
*  So you actually could profit from melting pennies. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2589.98s)]
*  People have been collecting pennies for a long time. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2593.3s)]
*  Right, but melting them down to sell it for raw copper is actually profitable. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2594.82s)]
*  It's the price of copper these days and you can figure out how many pennies makes a pound. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2598.18s)]
*  I remember when I was doing construction, one of the sites that one of the guys had [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2603.54s)]
*  got robbed where they stole all the copper pipes. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2607.94s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2610.38s)]
*  How much is copper worth? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2611.98s)]
*  It's worth a lot. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2612.98s)]
*  I would have never imagined that. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2614.14s)]
*  A US penny is worth made of 2.5% copper and 97.5% zinc. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2616.7s)]
*  That's the modern penny. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2623.22s)]
*  A penny contains a small amount of copper that's plated on top of a zinc base. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2625.22s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2629.02s)]
*  Yeah, but that's today's penny. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2630.02s)]
*  From 1982, they were made in 95% copper. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2631.94s)]
*  Okay, so in the 80s, they were real pennies. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2635.54s)]
*  So if you get one of them old pennies, that's a valuable penny. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2638.42s)]
*  The way a penny determines copper is zinc. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2641.1s)]
*  A copper penny weighs 3.11 grams while a zinc penny weighs 2.5. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2642.98s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2648.06s)]
*  Yeah, coins are weird. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2649.06s)]
*  Like enough of that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2651.3399999999997s)]
*  I know it's stupid because you are a part of the system and you can't control it, but [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2653.1800000000003s)]
*  I love paying for things with my phone. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2657.34s)]

*  I used to in Jacksonville. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2674.7400000000002s)]
*  Just use your face. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2676.1800000000003s)]

*  what did you do? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2706.74s)]
*  How much money did you spend on these fucking charging stations and how many of you made [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2709.1s)]
*  it? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2712.34s)]
*  All that kind of stuff. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2713.34s)]
*  If you look at all, if that's all applied to money too and it's digital money, how do [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2714.34s)]

*  That was one of the weirdest beginnings of quote of covid when I started really wondering [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2918.36s)]
*  how anybody could believe that this stupid surgical mask, which is supposed to stop [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2923.2799999999997s)]
*  like dripless a spit and food from your mouth dropping into a wound as you're operating. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2927.7999999999997s)]
*  They're not supposed to protect you from viruses. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2933.72s)]
*  That's not what they're there for. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2935.84s)]
*  The fact that people started wearing those to and then some people were just wearing [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2937.68s)]
*  bandanas. And my favorite, which is maybe the dumbest of all time, people would wear that shield. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2941.24s)]
*  So it's open air, open air. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2947.56s)]
*  All this is open. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  And then there's a shield and they would be walking down the street with a fucking shield [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2950.96s)]
*  over their face like this is mental illness. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2954.3199999999997s)]
*  That's all this is. This is not this is as people responding to stress that they can't [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2957.4s)]

*  That's all this is. This isn't normal. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2964.08s)]
*  And the more we allow this, the more we rationalize this and the more we we enable this by not [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2965.96s)]
*  telling them they're fucking ridiculous. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2972.6000000000004s)]
*  Take your goddamn mask off when you come into the store. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2974.4s)]

*  It's twenty twenty five. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2979.0800000000004s)]
*  Take that fucking stupid thing off. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2980.1600000000003s)]
*  And the more you don't you allow people to just continue with this delusion, they get [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2981.92s)]
*  in these social groups on on Twitter and they talk about the power of the mask. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2986.28s)]
*  And I feel so much better when I'm wearing a mask and you know, I'm being safer for others [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=2990.6800000000003s)]

*  You should go go salmon fishing. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3003.36s)]
*  Get the fuck outside your house. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3005.2799999999997s)]

*  Well, the doctor told me we had lunch with him about a week ago. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3022.52s)]
*  He says the one that told me quit smoking. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3025.28s)]

*  Right. And so I am a big guy. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3040.28s)]
*  And the one benefit that came from this is I don't smoke. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3043.8s)]
*  And I still do the CrossFit, even though you look at me and you can't tell. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3047.2000000000003s)]

*  I could do that one. That's the move. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3109.04s)]
*  I'm telling you, because I'm doing that one. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3110.84s)]
*  Yeah, I do that. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3112.32s)]
*  Whenever I do that, I feel way better. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3113.4s)]
*  I do it like in sprints because I'm Italian and Italians love pizza and pasta. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3115.0s)]
*  I love that shit. If I go to New York, I'm breaking my diet. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3120.36s)]
*  I'm going to get sandwiches for my man Giovanni's deli. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3123.04s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to eat Italian food. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3125.76s)]
*  I'm going to go off. I need it every now and then. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3127.6s)]
*  I just want to have it just for the. Oh, are you glad to have eggs on that one? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3130.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could have eggs. I eat eggs all the time. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3134.6s)]
*  The whole idea is you're only eating animal products. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3136.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, I don't eat anything else other than some fruit. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3140.36s)]
*  I'll eat like an orange or a banana here and there. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3144.12s)]
*  I'll have some blueberries with some yogurt. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3146.64s)]
*  But the idea is what you're really doing is mostly eating meat. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3148.7999999999997s)]
*  And so most of my diet is red meat. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3153.6s)]
*  And when I eat like that, I feel so much better. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3156.72s)]
*  I feel clear headed. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  I have more energy like it's more stable throughout the day. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3161.6s)]
*  I feel like my brain functions better. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3166.56s)]
*  When I eat carbs, I just start getting sloppy. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3169.68s)]
*  I start getting slow. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3172.72s)]
*  It's like I don't think there's anything wrong with carbohydrates. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3175.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3177.84s)]
*  But I do think that they're really easy to overconsume. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3179.0s)]
*  And if you're a glutton, which I definitely am, I'm a glutton. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3183.0s)]
*  I will eat two pizzas. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3186.08s)]
*  If you give me some fucking good, some really good like New York pizzas, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3187.64s)]
*  I will eat two of those bitches. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3191.7999999999997s)]
*  I will I will eat until I'm sick. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3193.04s)]
*  I just I've always been like that. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3195.52s)]
*  I always eat too much food. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3196.8s)]
*  I just I have an appetite that just it just won't stop with pasta. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3198.32s)]
*  But not with steak steak cuts you off. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3203.76s)]
*  There's a thing about eating protein steak, things like chicken. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3206.52s)]
*  You don't eat too much of it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3211.36s)]
*  You eat enough and then you stop. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3213.08s)]
*  You it's they have what's called a high satiety level, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3214.88s)]
*  like high protein foods have a very high satiety level. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3217.92s)]
*  And so like I'll eat like a 16 ounce elk steak. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3220.92s)]
*  I don't want to have nothing else. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3224.0s)]
*  I'm good. But if there's spaghetti there and if there's some fucking macaroni [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3225.24s)]
*  and cheese, you know, if there's potato salad, if there's a little bit, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3230.3999999999996s)]
*  then I'll start keep I'll keep going. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3233.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll keep eating and then I'll have way more calories really than I need [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3234.8799999999997s)]
*  with the same amount of nutrients. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3238.6s)]
*  The thing is, like for performance for like athletes, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3240.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't think the carnivore diet's the right way to go. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3243.8799999999997s)]
*  I think you should supplement with there's nothing wrong with. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3246.0s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with rice. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3248.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with with vegetables. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with fruit. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3253.52s)]
*  I think the real problem with a lot of people is pastas and breads [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3255.84s)]
*  and just processed food and garbage. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3261.28s)]
*  You know, I think we're just eating poison most of the day. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3265.7599999999998s)]
*  I think if you can just eat regular whole food, I think you're better off. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3269.12s)]
*  But I think you got to even now, I think you have to clean your rice [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3273.6s)]
*  because I've been I keep hearing shit about rice having glyphosate on it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3277.28s)]
*  Is that is that true? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3281.44s)]
*  They were I was reading this thing about rice being a [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3284.0s)]
*  I know it's the case with corn and wheat. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3287.92s)]
*  They think that's why some people have what they perceive to be a gluten [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3291.16s)]
*  sensitivity, but they really probably are getting sick from glyphosate, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3295.2s)]
*  which is so crazy to think. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3299.0s)]
*  But it sounds nuts. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3301.48s)]
*  But then they've tested people and they found the group that they tested. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3303.0s)]
*  90 percent of them had traceable levels of glyphosate in their blood. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3305.52s)]
*  Glyphosate drift to rice, a problem for us all. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3310.16s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3312.76s)]
*  This is from 2011. Fuck. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3313.96s)]
*  Damage inflicted by derelict glyphosate [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3319.7200000000003s)]
*  during this period is often invisible and not noticed until harvest. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3322.8s)]
*  Damage is characterized by significantly decreased yields and milling. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3326.2000000000003s)]
*  The rice often exhibits the first signal that has been hit with a drift [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3330.0800000000004s)]
*  kernel shaped like a parrot's beak. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3333.4s)]
*  This is so dark. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3335.28s)]
*  And then you eat it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3337.2000000000003s)]
*  Yay. Yay. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3339.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like, you know, the reality is farming. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3342.08s)]
*  And I'm no farmer. Right. Be clear. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3346.04s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about, but I've talked to a bunch of farmers. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3347.92s)]
*  I've talked to, you know, these guys like Joel Salatin, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3350.52s)]
*  who runs that poly face farms or Will Harris, who runs white pastures. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3353.92s)]
*  These guys who run these regenerative farms, what they're saying make sense. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3358.7599999999998s)]
*  They're saying the other way is suicide. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3363.64s)]
*  The other way is bad for the land. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3366.6s)]
*  It's bad for the people. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3368.8399999999997s)]
*  It's bad for the environment. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3370.2s)]
*  They're using tons of chemicals. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  The way to do it is the way nature has been doing it for millions of fucking years. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3373.4399999999996s)]
*  You have a bunch of cows, they shit in the grass. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3377.9199999999996s)]
*  You have a bunch of pigs. They root things up. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3380.3599999999997s)]
*  You have a bunch of chickens. They eat all the bugs. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3382.3599999999997s)]
*  Everybody lives together. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3384.3999999999996s)]
*  Everybody nutrient rich soil. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3385.8399999999997s)]
*  They're all like a part of this complete system, this complete ecological system. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3390.64s)]
*  And it's carbon neutral. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3397.0s)]
*  They say that when they raise cows like that, they actually sequester carbon. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3398.52s)]
*  The question is, can you feed everybody in L.A. and New York like that? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3404.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3408.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's like, what did we do? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3409.96s)]
*  We got so far ahead of ourselves that it seems like we've have this requirement [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3411.24s)]
*  for food that almost demands this kind of crazy farming. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3415.4s)]
*  That's where it's fucked, because if they don't farm like that, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3419.56s)]
*  if everybody has to go to like a Joel Salatin, Will Harris model, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3421.96s)]
*  is there enough land to grow enough meat like that? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3425.68s)]
*  Is there enough land to let all the pigs loose? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3429.56s)]
*  Is there enough land to have all the chickens just roaming around? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3431.92s)]
*  Is there enough land for that? I don't know. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3434.8799999999997s)]
*  There's some big farms on the way over that we saw coming across. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3437.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people eating a single farm in L.A. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3441.68s)]
*  and there's 20 million hungry people just scarfing up food all day long. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3445.44s)]
*  And you need all these farms out there just constantly making life forms for people to consume. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3449.44s)]
*  It's really a crazy, crazy thing that we've done [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3459.2000000000003s)]
*  because we've like completely overpopulated areas where they don't grow any food. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3463.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like the dumbest strategy of all time. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3468.44s)]
*  We rely 100 percent on transportation. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  That's right. And, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3474.16s)]
*  you know, people say, oh, there's a revolution coming. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3476.92s)]
*  It's here. I mean, the revolution is here. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3480.76s)]
*  What we're seeing right now is history being made [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3484.6800000000003s)]
*  because the people that have been taken advantage of forever, in my opinion, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3488.4s)]
*  are the people that are out there producing the farmers, the miners. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3493.7200000000003s)]
*  And the guys that I think really control, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3498.36s)]
*  they have their hand on the throttle of this country. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3502.96s)]
*  If they ever decide to take their hand off the throttle is the truckers. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3505.28s)]

*  Once they have those Tesla trucks that can just drive themselves, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3522.48s)]
*  they never get into car accidents. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3524.96s)]
*  Those fucking things are everywhere. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3526.56s)]

*  That's going to be a real problem [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3536.92s)]
*  because you're going to have so many people out of work [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3538.72s)]
*  and so many people that are going to say, hey, figure it out. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3540.44s)]
*  Well, they've been delivering your stuff. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3542.56s)]
*  You've been depending upon them. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3544.48s)]

*  Isn't that weird? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3760.4s)]
*  It did really feel like that. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3761.4s)]

*  I thought it was 58 million. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3807.32s)]
*  That's the one on the side of the page here though. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3808.32s)]
*  The claim that Mike Benz establishes in his research is that USAID paid out $27 million [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3813.72s)]
*  in grants to the Tide Foundation. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3819.6s)]

*  Fair and just prosecution. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3824.8799999999997s)]
*  Benz frames this as though it's evidence of USAID funding fair and just prosecution. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3826.72s)]
*  That seems like it is. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  This framing only works. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3836.0s)]
*  You have no idea what the Tides Foundation is or how large foundations like it operate. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3837.2799999999997s)]
*  The Tides is an intermediary funder, meaning that it facilitates grants from originating [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3842.24s)]
*  grantors, the money people to receive grantees, the people getting the money. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3847.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're a big organization like USAID, you don't give money to Tides to do with it what [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3851.52s)]
*  they will. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3855.64s)]
*  You forward money through Tides to a specific recipient of your choosing. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3856.7999999999997s)]
*  Why do you send your money through middlemen instead of giving it directly? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3861.3999999999996s)]
*  For the same reason people always use middlemen to facilitate contracts because middlemen know [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3864.2799999999997s)]
*  how to deal with paperwork, to supervise contracts and so on. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3869.4s)]
*  Did USAID give money to FJP? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3872.2799999999997s)]
*  You can figure that out quickly for yourself. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3875.04s)]
*  Go to usaspending.gov, set keyword Tides and awarding agency to USAID. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3876.68s)]

*  As far as I can tell, that's a little vague. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=3999.04s)]
*  It mainly means they give money out to nonprofits in foreign countries to do things like monitor [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4002.04s)]

*  Doesn't mean it goes to Soros funds, but you didn't disprove it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4065.28s)]
*  Well that's any more you can't hardly tell is true. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4069.76s)]

*  If you're involved in it, improve it somehow to make it a better rumor. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4091.24s)]
*  One of the most recent rumors and I was talking to Drew this morning, the rumor that Elon [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4097.44s)]

*  He didn't do that. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4113.48s)]
*  I wonder if that's even legal. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4114.48s)]
*  That was fake news. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4116.88s)]
*  But that seems like if you can make a stylish video about, I wonder if that's legal. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4118.28s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4125.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know what the rules are. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4126.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't even know if it should be legal. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4128.12s)]
*  What are the rules in terms of if you're involved in some sort of a government agency or a government [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4130.28s)]
*  discovery agency, which is like what Doge is, right? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4136.2s)]
*  If you're involved in that, would you be able to propagandize to the people, even if it's [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4140.900000000001s)]
*  true? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4146.8s)]
*  If you're involved in a video showing how amazing a job you're doing and doing it in [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4148.72s)]
*  a cinematic way that makes it compelling. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4150.96s)]
*  That seems like a lot of influence. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4153.400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4155.8s)]

*  Yeah, but that's just the Internet. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4160.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4161.64s)]

*  Didn't see one in the first quarter in the second quarter, the half. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4171.8s)]
*  The game was kind of over. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4176.72s)]
*  Well, that's like when everybody thought that JFK Jr. was going to come back to life and [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4178.280000000001s)]

*  you forget about other things like what's Benghazi? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4209.5s)]
*  I got this to worry about. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4212.42s)]

*  He doesn't quite look like Kubrick, but he looks like a weird old guy with a beard. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4294.82s)]
*  And so if you don't know what Kubrick looks like. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4298.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's not Kubrick. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4300.86s)]
*  But if anybody faked the moon landing, it was that guy. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4303.58s)]
*  What about Buzz Aldrin? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4307.54s)]
*  Have you? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4308.54s)]
*  I think he came out and said, no, I would know. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4309.54s)]
*  We didn't land there. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4312.9s)]
*  Well, he said some weird stuff, but the weird stuff you could attribute to like Biden type [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4314.0599999999995s)]
*  weird stuff. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4318.98s)]
*  Like when you get old, sometimes the old dome don't work so good and your words come out [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4319.98s)]
*  goofy. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4324.139999999999s)]
*  Like he was talking to that young girl because it didn't happen. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4325.139999999999s)]
*  We never went. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4327.46s)]
*  Like he said something weird like that. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4328.46s)]
*  But I think as a conspiracy theorist, I want to believe that that's him letting everybody [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4331.0599999999995s)]
*  know. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4336.46s)]
*  That's not nearly as interesting as the Neil Armstrong one. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4337.46s)]
*  The Neil Armstrong one is crazy. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4342.62s)]
*  And this is at the 25th anniversary of the moon landing. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4344.98s)]
*  He gives a speech in front of America's best and brightest high school students. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4348.62s)]
*  And instead of saying I went to the moon, it was amazing. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4353.9s)]
*  He gives the most cryptic explanation for what they have to do in order to progress [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4359.7s)]
*  in science. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4368.08s)]
*  Play it for me, Jamie, because when you see it, when you listen to like, what the fuck [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4370.58s)]
*  is he saying? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4375.34s)]
*  And why would you ever say that when you're given a speech to the best high school students [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4376.34s)]
*  in the country at the White House? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4382.46s)]
*  Why would you say this? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4384.98s)]
*  Like play anniversary of the event in 1994, Neil Armstrong made a rare public appearance [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4386.14s)]
*  and held back tears as he spoke these brief cryptic remarks before the next generation [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4392.14s)]
*  of taxpayers as they toured the White House. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4397.18s)]
*  Today we have with us a group of students among America's best. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4401.66s)]
*  To you we say we've only completed a beginning. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4408.740000000001s)]
*  We leave you much that is undone. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4414.58s)]
*  There are great ideas undiscovered. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4419.9800000000005s)]
*  Breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth's protective layers. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4423.38s)]
*  What the fuck does that mean? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4432.14s)]
*  Breakthroughs for those who can remove one of truth's protective layers. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4436.78s)]
*  Truth's protective layers? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4442.7s)]
*  What the fuck does that mean? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4446.58s)]
*  Like, why would you say that? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4447.58s)]
*  That is so cryptic. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4448.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't care what reasonable explanations you have. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4450.74s)]
*  That is undeniably cryptic. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4454.82s)]
*  And if you're a person that did something in 1969 that no one's come even close to recreating [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4457.78s)]
*  today, it's a little weird. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4464.5s)]
*  It's a little weird. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4467.42s)]
*  And that's just part of what's a little weird about it. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4468.88s)]
*  It's a little weird that it's got almost a religious connotation to it where people want [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4471.099999999999s)]
*  to believe in it like they believe in the resurrection. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4475.5s)]
*  They want to believe in it despite any evidence. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4478.08s)]
*  I believe in the resurrection more. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4481.32s)]
*  How about that? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4483.12s)]
*  Take that rumor and twist it around however you want. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4484.12s)]
*  Make it something you can deal with. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4490.04s)]
*  The moon landing one, I'm like, I don't know. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4491.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4494.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4495.44s)]
*  But if I had to guess, I don't think so. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4496.44s)]
*  And then what's really weird is we had that Bart Sabril guy on. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4500.46s)]
*  That was his documentary. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4505.16s)]
*  Anything happened on the way to the moon? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4506.8s)]
*  He was showing us some footage where the Russians had used AI to do an analysis on some of the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4509.4800000000005s)]
*  photos from the moon. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4515.72s)]
*  And they said that they were deceptive. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4517.12s)]
*  So they use AI on all these other images. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4519.360000000001s)]
*  It can show like a high 90% accuracy whether or not something's been fucked with. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4521.16s)]
*  And they're like, these are all, these have been monkeyed with. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4526.12s)]
*  It was all edited. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4529.28s)]
*  You don't know what to believe. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4532.76s)]
*  I mean, I just saw a clip yesterday with my voice again. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4534.04s)]
*  I'd sent you something. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4537.04s)]
*  I sent you one of them. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4539.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4540.96s)]
*  No, it has you and me talking like this and we're talking about some space enterprise [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4541.96s)]
*  with stars, ships and shit. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4546.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going, how do they do this? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4549.76s)]
*  They can do a whole podcast with your voice now. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4551.72s)]
*  Not only could they do a whole podcast with your voice, AI could generate the content. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4554.76s)]
*  Like you'd say, I want to talk to John Reeves about biological evolution and what the current [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4558.320000000001s)]
*  state of science is and what the future holds for us. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4563.28s)]
*  And that'll be used in the clip that we're going to see within a week. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4567.5599999999995s)]
*  Probably. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4570.96s)]
*  Your voice. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4571.96s)]
*  Probably because they could make a one hour podcast with you just relaying the current [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4572.96s)]
*  state of the art and science. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4576.88s)]
*  It's really wild. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4579.04s)]
*  It's probably going to get worse. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4582.04s)]
*  Like it's going to be so good that I'm going to think it's you or I'm going to think it's [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4583.04s)]
*  me. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4586.88s)]
*  I'm like, maybe I forgot about that one. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4587.88s)]
*  You know, as I get older, you know, I forget shit. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4589.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's true. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4593.2s)]
*  I think that's a defense mechanism. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4594.2s)]
*  I don't want to remember. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4596.28s)]
*  I don't want to remember that one. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4597.28s)]
*  I'll forget about that one. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4600.08s)]
*  But, you know, we we both made it around one more time around the sun. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4602.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4608.64s)]
*  And it's been an unbelievable year. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4609.64s)]
*  You know, what we've both seen in the last year. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4613.44s)]
*  It's definitely been a it's a wild time to be alive. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4617.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4619.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4620.72s)]
*  But filled with turmoil. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4622.56s)]
*  I think it's also because it's so quick. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4625.08s)]
*  The information that you can get is coming at you from every direction. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4627.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4631.76s)]
*  Instantly. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4632.76s)]
*  Instantly. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4633.76s)]
*  But in 1920, that wasn't happening. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4634.76s)]
*  No, it wasn't happening in 1880. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4636.400000000001s)]
*  No, it was like you didn't know. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4638.68s)]
*  Like when Seward bought Alaska, it was you didn't know why he did that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4642.0s)]
*  I think everybody said Seward's folly. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4646.320000000001s)]
*  How about Seward's genius? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4649.64s)]
*  They thought it was a bad deal. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4651.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4653.8s)]
*  How much? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4654.8s)]
*  Seven million dollars for Alaska. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4655.8s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4657.4400000000005s)]
*  Two cents an acre. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4658.96s)]
*  Now, let me tell you something. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4659.96s)]
*  A guy named Klaus Nasky, who is a doctor of history at University of Alaska, I used to [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4661.160000000001s)]
*  teach his kid how to swim. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4666.4800000000005s)]
*  Him and I were at a social function someplace and we were talking and we're talking about [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4668.8s)]
*  the purchase of Alaska. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4673.4800000000005s)]
*  And he goes, you know why we did that, right? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4674.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, well, yeah, Seward wanted to buy it and seven million bucks. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4676.4800000000005s)]
*  He goes, yeah, we gave seven million dollars to Russia. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4680.76s)]
*  I said, okay, that's yeah, they sold it to us. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4685.04s)]
*  He goes, why do you think they did that? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4687.76s)]
*  I said, I don't know. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4691.24s)]
*  They said it's because the seals were gone. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4693.64s)]
*  You know, they had gotten all the seals trade done. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4696.24s)]
*  He goes, that's not why. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4700.0s)]
*  During the Civil War, Russia blockaded Charleston Harbor with their warships and it helped the [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4702.400000000001s)]
*  North win the Civil War. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4708.48s)]
*  And a bill for that was seven million dollars. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4710.639999999999s)]
*  And they knew they couldn't just go out to America and say, yeah, the Russians helped [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4714.08s)]
*  us win the Civil War. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4718.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4719.759999999999s)]
*  This is what he told me. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4720.759999999999s)]
*  He's a doctor of history. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4722.08s)]
*  And I said the same thing. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4725.719999999999s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4726.719999999999s)]
*  He goes, nobody talks about it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4727.719999999999s)]
*  Nobody even mentions it. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4730.36s)]
*  But Russia took the seven million and they gave us Alaska. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4733.16s)]
*  That'll justify this seven million dollars. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4737.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4741.0s)]
*  What do you think about the idea that the United States taking over Canada? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4742.0s)]
*  Well, it makes Alaska the third largest fucking state. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4747.2s)]
*  First we got to get Greenland. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4751.4s)]
*  Let's get Greenland so we got them surrounded, kind of. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4752.4s)]
*  I thought he was just joking around about Canada, but he seemed serious. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4755.44s)]
*  Well, I think Drew was talking about this the other day. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4759.36s)]
*  I don't know how many provinces, but they're different. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4765.08s)]
*  And so what they might want to do is make seven new states because the people in Alberta [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4769.76s)]
*  do different stuff than the people in... [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4774.8s)]
*  You can't just have the state of Canada. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4778.12s)]
*  No, because it'd be like LA and New York calling the elections. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4780.24s)]
*  No, it would be way worse because Montreal and Quebec is French. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4784.0s)]
*  I mean, it's basically French speaking. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4788.0s)]
*  Everyone speaks French. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4791.0s)]
*  It's so different than the rest of the country. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4792.4s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of French speaking people in Canada in general, but there's way more [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4793.92s)]
*  on the East Coast. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4798.24s)]
*  Vancouver and Montreal are very different places. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4799.68s)]
*  They have to be different cities, man. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4803.0s)]
*  Different states. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4806.6s)]
*  You can't have them be just one part of a big country. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4807.6s)]
*  If there's seven different provinces, yeah, so we have seven new states now. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4811.400000000001s)]
*  Fine. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4814.68s)]
*  Why not? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4815.68s)]
*  What, we can't count past 51? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4816.68s)]
*  What is that? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4818.36s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4819.36s)]
*  People forget what it's like to expand America. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4820.839999999999s)]
*  The last time we did it was Alaska. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4824.759999999999s)]
*  People just get scared of it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4827.92s)]
*  They get scared of the idea of the empire, the American empire expanding. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4828.92s)]
*  It makes you think about Hitler. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4832.44s)]
*  It makes you think about fascism and dangerous military decisions that get made, takeover [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4833.44s)]
*  countries and wars that happen. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4841.36s)]
*  That's what people get scared of. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4843.2s)]
*  But if Canada just wants to join, that'd be pretty cool. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4845.12s)]
*  Yeah, they got a lot of natural resources. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4847.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4850.16s)]
*  Also, their government's goofy as shit. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4851.16s)]
*  You guys don't even have freedom of speech. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4854.24s)]
*  You should be protected by the Constitution. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4856.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, then they get the Second Amendment. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4858.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4860.2s)]
*  Well, they used to have gun laws over there that were pretty favorable, but then when [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4861.2s)]
*  Trudeau came around, you can't even give someone a handgun, I don't think, anymore. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4865.360000000001s)]
*  It's gotten, well, I know a few Canadians. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4871.16s)]
*  They don't like Trudeau. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4874.96s)]
*  They don't like what he's done to the country. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4875.96s)]
*  Well, there's got to be somebody that likes him. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4878.44s)]
*  He keeps winning. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4880.04s)]
*  He's got the numbers. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4881.04s)]
*  Canada's so kind. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4882.04s)]
*  They're so nice that they're willing to give a dork like that a second and a third chance. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4885.04s)]
*  Well, the farmers don't like him, I don't think. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4893.04s)]
*  The miners don't like him. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4898.04s)]
*  Well, certainly the truck drivers that are involved in that trucker convoy. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4899.04s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4902.36s)]
*  Not just the trucker convoy, but the people that donated to the trucker convoy got their [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4903.719999999999s)]
*  bank account shut down, which is just crazy. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4908.28s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4911.32s)]
*  Like, you got to have laws against that. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4912.32s)]
*  That's tyranny. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4914.08s)]
*  You can't allow people to shut down someone's entire bank account. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4915.08s)]
*  They can't feed themselves because they donated to a person who's politically opposed to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4918.36s)]
*  what you're doing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4923.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4924.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4925.04s)]
*  Anyway, so Alaska, I think, coming from the guy that told me that, he's dead now, but [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4926.04s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4933.400000000001s)]
*  But back then, there was no fact checkers. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4934.400000000001s)]
*  There was no way to tell people what was going on. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4936.400000000001s)]
*  So let's just tell them we bought it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4939.400000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4942.0s)]
*  Russia helped the United States win the Civil War. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4943.36s)]
*  See, have you ever found anything on that, Jamie? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4945.400000000001s)]
*  I've never heard that before. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4947.68s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised, though. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4949.64s)]
*  Sure, back then, they could hide all kinds of shit, too. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4951.08s)]
*  The North didn't have the Navy. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4953.4800000000005s)]
*  How much do you think Greenland's worth? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4955.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I was talking to my accountant this morning. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4957.76s)]
*  I think Greenland, if it became a state, it would be the largest state in the country. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4961.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4969.28s)]
*  It's a big spot. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4970.28s)]
*  And then Alaska would be second. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4971.28s)]
*  But Texas is always going to be screwed. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4972.84s)]
*  No matter how many more states we get, Texas is always going to go down the list. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4976.4800000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4980.24s)]
*  It's still huge. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4981.24s)]
*  Greenland, then Canada, Alaska, America. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4982.72s)]
*  I kind of like Mexico, too. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4987.76s)]
*  Might as well take the whole, all of it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4988.76s)]
*  I don't think Mexico has been down with that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4991.639999999999s)]
*  The Mexicans would probably be very upset if we tried to take over Mexico. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4993.599999999999s)]
*  But it would be nice if Mexico had the same opportunities as America, and that it wasn't [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=4996.44s)]
*  so attractive to try to swim across the river to get here. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5000.68s)]
*  Well, what I don't get, Joe, we got a pretty good Navy. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5005.96s)]
*  We got a pretty good Air Force. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5009.84s)]
*  We got a pretty good military base. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5011.0s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing not sending A-10s down there into Mexico and taking those fentanyl [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5014.28s)]
*  labs out? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5018.639999999999s)]
*  What are you going to do, Mexico? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5020.52s)]
*  You don't like us doing that? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5022.52s)]
*  We just said they're terrorists. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5023.52s)]
*  We're going to blow up their fucking buildings. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5024.52s)]
*  Well, tell them we're coming. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5026.96s)]
*  But we're going to blow the fuck out of that stuff. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5028.68s)]
*  They're going to have no infrastructure left. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5030.92s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5033.04s)]
*  No more avocados? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5034.6s)]
*  Give me a fucking break. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5035.6s)]
*  Send some A-10s. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5038.04s)]
*  I've had A-10s on my ground, buzzing my ground for years. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5039.04s)]
*  They practice on my ground. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5042.72s)]
*  Well, they're awesome. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5044.84s)]
*  Those pilots are good. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5046.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of little warthogs in there to take care of business. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5048.12s)]
*  What do you think that looks like? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5052.28s)]
*  A war with the cartels? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5053.5599999999995s)]
*  I've stumbled across this, but that doesn't exactly say the same thing. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5054.8s)]
*  It says, while all this is transpiring, one of the most unusual events in diplomatic and [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5058.5199999999995s)]
*  naval history occurred. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5062.04s)]
*  Russia dispatched to her Atlantic and Pacific naval squadrons to the United States ports. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5063.32s)]
*  They arrived in New York and San Francisco respectively in September 1863 at a time when [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5068.12s)]
*  the tide of war had turned in the favor of the North at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5073.28s)]
*  The fleets remained in the United States waters for about seven months before being ordered [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5078.24s)]
*  to return to their homeland. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5082.36s)]
*  They must have had wooden ships then because I just found their first iron-clad ship was [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5084.5599999999995s)]
*  built in Britain in 1861. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5090.88s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5092.88s)]
*  Instead, it stayed in Russian waters the entire time. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5093.88s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5096.12s)]
*  Because they had their own civil war just after this. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5097.12s)]
*  Bro, they were going to war with wood ships. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5098.48s)]
*  Gangster. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5101.5199999999995s)]
*  They knocked the shit out of the seal population. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5102.76s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5105.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5106.96s)]
*  They were really good at what they did. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5107.96s)]
*  What did they used to be like? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5109.96s)]
*  Seals everywhere up there? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5111.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5112.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5113.96s)]
*  And are they endangered now? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5114.96s)]
*  Like, what's the... [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5115.96s)]
*  I don't really know because we don't have any in our area, but I have a friend that's [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5116.96s)]
*  a mechanic who's telling me he had a lady come into his auto shop and said something's [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5120.84s)]
*  wrong with her engine. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5129.8s)]
*  So he went out and told her, he said, it looks like you blew a seal. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5132.48s)]
*  No. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5136.48s)]
*  And she said, no, I had tuna fish for lunch. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5137.48s)]
*  Yeah, you don't tell a comic a joke, do you? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5139.48s)]
*  Yeah, yes, I've been saving that one. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5143.48s)]
*  I know that native Alaskans are allowed to hunt seals and they eat them. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5146.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5153.48s)]
*  But regular people can't. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5154.48s)]
*  I think they share. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5156.88s)]
*  There's weird rules on that, though. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5157.88s)]
*  Yeah, you might be able to share, but you can't hunt... [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5159.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5161.16s)]
*  ...successes harvesting. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5162.16s)]
*  Yeah, you ever watch that show, Life Below Zero? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5163.16s)]
*  I have seen that. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5165.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5166.16s)]
*  Part of that show was like this one guy was living with this native Alaskan wife and their [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5167.16s)]
*  kids and they would go hunt the seals and she would like shoot the seals and she had [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5173.04s)]
*  to pull the trigger. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5177.36s)]
*  Then he could help like butcher them up. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5178.36s)]
*  So there's about 141,000 in non-glacial areas now. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5180.36s)]
*  Wikipedia says that there were 300,000 for once population in the 1850s. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5186.84s)]
*  Oh, no, that's sea otters. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5193.84s)]
*  Oh, so I guess I read that wrong. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5195.84s)]
*  It says once a population of 300,000 sea otters was almost extinct. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5198.04s)]
*  Russia needed money after being defeated by France and Britain in the Crimean War. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5204.92s)]
*  The California Gold Rush showed that gold were discovered in Alaska. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5208.4s)]
*  Americans and Canadians could overwhelm the Russian presence in what one scholar later [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5211.76s)]
*  described as Siberia's Siberia. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5215.679999999999s)]
*  However, the principal reason for the sale was that the hard to defend colony would be [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5217.679999999999s)]
*  easily conquered by British forces based in neighboring Canada in any future conflict [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5221.84s)]
*  and Russia did not wish to see its arch rival being next door just across the Bering Sea. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5226.759999999999s)]
*  Therefore, Emperor Alexander II decided to sell the territory. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5233.5199999999995s)]
*  The Russian government discussed the proposal in 1857 and 1858 and offered to sell the territory [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5236.5599999999995s)]
*  to the United States. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5241.799999999999s)]
*  So as before all that in the Civil War. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5243.0599999999995s)]
*  Hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of Britain. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5246.16s)]
*  However, no deal was reached as the risk of an American Civil War was more pressing concern [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5249.5199999999995s)]
*  in Washington. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5255.04s)]
*  A plausible space for our new news today in this story. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5256.04s)]
*  Our new news? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5260.5s)]
*  What he said about the Russian ships that kind of fits, it could happen. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5261.5s)]
*  Yes, because it says 1857 to 1858, they agreed to sell it and offered to sell. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5264.639999999999s)]
*  So they agreed, but then they had to put it on the back burner because of the war. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5271.04s)]
*  So then after the war they bought it. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5275.92s)]
*  So it might have been that they said, look, we'll still buy it, but help us out. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5277.5199999999995s)]
*  This is how we got to cover our ass. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5281.12s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5282.12s)]
*  Yeah, well this guy's like Dr. Emeritus in history. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5283.6s)]
*  I mean, he knows his shit. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5286.76s)]
*  The problem is then you have to trust those guys. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5287.76s)]
*  I'd rather trust Wikipedia. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5290.64s)]
*  Yeah, anything I read on Wikipedia has got to be true. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5293.2s)]
*  Way less sea otters now, 70,000. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5296.36s)]
*  Oh, there's only 70,000 left? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5298.08s)]
*  Sea otters though? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5300.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5301.36s)]
*  Sea otters are vicious little fuckers. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5302.36s)]
*  Slingsby up there in Nome, he sees a lot of that kind of stuff. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5308.639999999999s)]
*  Otters? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5312.88s)]
*  All the sea life up there. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5313.88s)]

*  You follow him. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5316.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's a giant difference between the coastal Alaska and regular Alaska. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5317.88s)]
*  Coastal Alaska is wild. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5322.5599999999995s)]

*  Through the ice? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5375.599999999999s)]

*  Really? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5378.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5379.16s)]

*  It's right offshore, right there in Nome. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5381.16s)]

*  It's also it's a legitimate cognitive enhancer. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5609.5s)]
*  It's a legitimate what they call a nootropic. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5611.94s)]

*  It won't be smoking. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5642.54s)]
*  It might be a bear coming up on me without me seeing it. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5643.54s)]
*  Might drive a cat over the edge. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5649.62s)]

*  Why? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5659.98s)]
*  Child of the 70s, man. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5660.98s)]
*  It's all fucked up. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5663.98s)]
*  No seatbelts. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5665.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5666.94s)]
*  You know, there's a former governor of Alaska named Walter Hickel that Richard Nixon appointed [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5668.94s)]
*  to be Secretary of the Interior in 1970. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5676.259999999999s)]
*  So he went and did that and went into Nixon one day and says, the Vietnam War is wrong. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5679.7s)]
*  Nixon goes, you're fired. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5687.0599999999995s)]
*  Now get out of here. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5688.0599999999995s)]
*  So he went back to Alaska and became a governor, a great governor. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5690.48s)]
*  Probably one of the best governors we ever had. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5693.7s)]
*  At some point, he was a Republican, but the Republicans already had a candidate. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5698.22s)]
*  The Democrats had a candidate. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5703.58s)]
*  So he ran as an Alaskan for Independence candidate. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5704.94s)]
*  Their party platform was to secede from the United States. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5708.86s)]
*  And I used to be the treasurer for that group. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5712.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going, I like this guy. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5714.78s)]
*  That sounds like fun. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5718.3s)]
*  Let's do that. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5719.34s)]
*  That guy got elected. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5720.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5721.82s)]
*  And Jack Coghill was his lieutenant governor. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5722.82s)]
*  I knew him quite well. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5724.98s)]
*  So he wanted to become a country. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5726.36s)]
*  I still do. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5728.28s)]
*  I'm telling you, my contingent. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5729.28s)]
*  You want the United States to take over Canada, but you want Alaska to be its own country. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5733.0s)]
*  This was all when Biden was there. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5737.74s)]
*  I'm thinking worst case scenario, we're going to get the girl that didn't want to be on [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5740.0s)]
*  your show. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5744.0s)]
*  If we get her, I want Alaska to become its own country. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5745.32s)]
*  We just got to get away from this. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5749.96s)]
*  It's a train wreck. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5751.759999999999s)]
*  But since Trump got in and he's doing the things that he said he was going to do. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5753.4s)]
*  Hey, I like the idea. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5757.36s)]
*  You want to expand America? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5758.759999999999s)]
*  Expand America. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5760.0s)]
*  It's a good idea. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5761.0s)]
*  It's been done before. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5762.0s)]
*  So you're willing to keep Alaska as part of America. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5763.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5764.0s)]
*  Why don't you run for governor? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5765.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck that. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5766.0s)]
*  You'd be a fun governor. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5767.0s)]
*  I would be a fun governor. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5768.0s)]
*  The way you said it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5769.0s)]
*  Give it a go. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5774.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5775.0s)]
*  Successful Alaska businessman. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5776.0s)]
*  Why don't you run for governor? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5777.0s)]
*  I don't have time. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5778.0s)]
*  I'm busy. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5779.0s)]
*  I know you're busy. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5780.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5781.6s)]
*  No, I can't do it. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5784.6s)]
*  You don't need that in your life. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5785.6s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5786.6s)]
*  I'm completely kidding. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5787.6s)]
*  People come up and go, give me some something. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5788.6s)]
*  This is an issue. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5793.6s)]
*  And I'm thinking, why is it an issue? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5795.6s)]
*  I don't give a shit about that. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5797.6s)]
*  That's not a good politician. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5799.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5801.6s)]
*  A politician I knew that I talked to one day was a state senator. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5802.6s)]
*  He goes, hey, I'm going to run for governor. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5806.6s)]
*  He goes, here's a trick. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5810.200000000001s)]
*  All you do when they say that, you go, I see. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5812.200000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5817.200000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5818.200000000001s)]
*  Just say, I see. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5819.200000000001s)]
*  You listen to them, I see, and you don't really care. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5820.200000000001s)]
*  No, you don't give a fuck. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5824.200000000001s)]
*  Well, a lot of them definitely don't. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5826.200000000001s)]
*  A lot of them are just using it as like an audition to become president. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5828.200000000001s)]
*  You know, they just want to do a good enough job to get the big job. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5831.200000000001s)]
*  Well, President Trump just announced recently that he wants to get a gas line built through Alaska. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5836.8s)]
*  And talking about governors, Governor Palin appointed me to be the gas line project coordinator for DOT back when she was governor. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5844.8s)]
*  And there's another guy that worked for DOT named Frank Richards. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5853.8s)]
*  And so I went to work to get a gas line permit written and worked with a guy named Harry Noah, who was a commissioner under DNR's, I'm sorry, under Governor Hickel. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5859.400000000001s)]
*  He was a commissioner of DNR. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5870.400000000001s)]
*  So him and I worked on this permit to get a pipeline built through Alaska. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5872.400000000001s)]
*  It took us three years. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5876.400000000001s)]
*  I'm the guy that wrote it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5878.400000000001s)]
*  I'm the guy that signed it along with Harry. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5879.400000000001s)]
*  So when President Trump was doing an interview three days after he got elected, he goes, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5881.400000000001s)]
*  And we have a fully permitted pipeline in Alaska to go ahead and build a gas line through Alaska. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5886.4s)]
*  I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop the TV, back it up a little bit. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5890.4s)]
*  I wrote the fucking permit. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5894.4s)]
*  I signed the fucking permit. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5897.4s)]
*  He's talking about some work that I did. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5899.4s)]
*  That's all right. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5901.4s)]
*  So Frank Richards now is the president of Alaska Gas Line Project. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5902.4s)]
*  And they just inked a deal with Japan, who came in and said, yeah, we want to buy into this. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5909.4s)]
*  It's a $44 billion project. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5915.4s)]
*  So what's the hurdle for pipelines and for oil drilling in the past? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5917.4s)]
*  Is it environmental? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5924.4s)]
*  The people worried it's going to ruin the environment? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5925.4s)]
*  There's a thing called ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Range. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5927.4s)]
*  I think it's, yeah, something like that. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5932.4s)]
*  And when the president renamed, well, ANWR, you're not allowed to drill in ANWR. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5934.4s)]
*  You can't drill for oil in ANWR. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5940.4s)]
*  There's a lot of oil there. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5941.4s)]
*  But the feds said you can't drill for oil there. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5943.4s)]
*  You can't produce oil out of there. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5946.4s)]
*  But that was for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5948.4s)]
*  But if you change it to the America National Wildlife Refuge, kind of like the Gulf of America, you might be able to drill in there. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5952.4s)]
*  Is that really all it takes? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5959.4s)]
*  You just got to rename it? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5960.4s)]
*  Apparently, the Gulf of America works. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5961.4s)]
*  So they're going to redrill, they're going to start drilling in the Gulf of America now? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5964.4s)]
*  It is, by the way, very hilarious. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5968.4s)]
*  I bet they do. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5970.4s)]
*  When he said it at the inauguration, it was like, this motherfucker, like this is such a crazy thing to say. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5971.4s)]
*  And he did it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5977.4s)]
*  He signed it yesterday on the way across the Gulf of America. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5978.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5981.4s)]
*  I was in, where were we staying? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5984.4s)]
*  On the way over in Louisiana having dinner. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5988.4s)]
*  I asked the waitress, I said, how far away are we from the Gulf of America? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5992.4s)]
*  What if it looks to kill? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=5996.4s)]
*  Well, we're very divided as a country. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6002.4s)]
*  My hope is that what he does winds up being undeniably good. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6005.4s)]
*  This is the best case scenario. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6010.4s)]
*  That's what I hope for every president. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6011.4s)]
*  What happens is undeniably good. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6012.4s)]
*  Everybody benefits. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6015.4s)]
*  And we all realize, like, hey, this is we're going to be OK. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6016.4s)]
*  But we should be united as a country. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6019.4s)]
*  We shouldn't be united only with the people of our political party. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6021.4s)]
*  That's stupid. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6024.4s)]
*  We're supposed to be one team. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6025.4s)]
*  And, you know, this is the new coach or this is the new president. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6027.4s)]
*  OK, like, get on board. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6030.4s)]
*  This is this is what's happening now. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6033.4s)]
*  And if there's something that you think is egregiously wrong, like all this USA stuff, like, hey, maybe there's some really good programs in there that we should all examine and we should reinstate. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6035.4s)]
*  But they should examine it. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6044.4s)]
*  The idea that you shouldn't examine it, that there's no argument for that. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6046.4s)]
*  Once you found two hundred million dollars that goes to transgender animal tests, you know you got some fuckery. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6049.4s)]
*  Like you can't spend two hundred million dollars on transgender animal tests while you're thirty six trillion dollars in debt and not spending any money on East Palestine. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6056.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6066.4s)]
*  Like what happened in that place? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6067.4s)]
*  Huh? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6068.4s)]
*  What's what about the toxic spill in East Palestine? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6069.4s)]
*  What about the health effects of those people that deal with that burning toxic shit in their air for weeks and weeks? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6072.4s)]
*  What happened to them? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6078.4s)]
*  Anybody check? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6079.4s)]
*  Anybody go into that ground and see what the fucking the groundwater is like? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6080.4s)]
*  Anybody dig that stuff out and fucking process it? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6084.4s)]
*  Are they doing anything about that? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6087.4s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6088.4s)]
*  They go in. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6089.4s)]
*  You can see videos where they stick sticks in the water and the machine comes right out. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6090.4s)]
*  How about Flint, Michigan? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6094.4s)]
*  How about that? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6096.4s)]
*  How about their water still fucked up? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6097.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6098.4s)]
*  I get a glass of water. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6099.4s)]
*  Remember Obama did that? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6100.4s)]
*  This is not a stunt. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6101.4s)]
*  I want a glass of water. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6102.4s)]
*  And he sips it like this. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6103.4s)]
*  Like a little lizard. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6105.4s)]
*  He barely drank it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6107.4s)]
*  It's so crazy to ask for a glass of water where you know the water is polluted and you don't even drink it. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6110.4s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6118.4s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6119.4s)]
*  You didn't even take a gulp. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6120.4s)]
*  You ever see that? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6122.4s)]
*  He sips it like this, like this. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6123.4s)]
*  Like barely. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6125.4s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6127.4s)]
*  No. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6128.4s)]
*  You should watch it. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6129.4s)]
*  You should watch it because it's fun. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6130.4s)]
*  It's fun to watch because it's so crazy. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6131.4s)]
*  It's almost like they were trying to talk him into it. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6132.4s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not drinking that fucking water. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6135.4s)]
*  And they're like, listen, just drink a little bit of it. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6137.4s)]
*  Just drink it. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6139.4s)]
*  It'll be good for everybody. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6140.4s)]
*  Just go out there and say, can I get a glass of water? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6141.4s)]
*  It is. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6144.4s)]
*  There you go. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6145.4s)]
*  You know, generally I have not been doing stunts here, but you know. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6146.4s)]
*  And this used a filter. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6152.4s)]
*  You know, the water around this table was plant water that was filtered. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6157.4s)]
*  And it just confirms what we know scientifically, which is that if you're using a filter, if you're installing it, then plant water at this point is drinkable. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6162.4s)]
*  Stop. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6175.4s)]
*  Pause. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6176.4s)]
*  If I was in the audience, I'd be yelling, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6177.4s)]
*  Get him gallons of that and then monitor his diarrhea. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6181.4s)]
*  OK, let's see. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6184.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6185.4s)]
*  You didn't even drink that. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6186.4s)]
*  Make your pasta in that, sir. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6187.4s)]
*  Go make your rice in that water. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6189.4s)]
*  Using a filter. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6191.4s)]
*  These people are so poor. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6193.4s)]
*  They like that's a very impoverished community. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6194.4s)]
*  I bet a lot of those people don't have filters. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6196.4s)]
*  So you're saying if they don't have filters, they're fucked. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6198.4s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6200.4s)]
*  And you only drank it like this. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6202.4s)]
*  You barely drank it. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6204.4s)]
*  Didn't move. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6205.4s)]
*  The level of water didn't change. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6206.4s)]
*  You just dipped your tongue in there. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6208.4s)]
*  You didn't really drink. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6210.4s)]
*  That's so crazy to not drink it. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6211.4s)]
*  Well, we did eight years with that guy, right? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6213.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6215.4s)]
*  We got out of a long relationship. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6217.4s)]
*  Well, kind of with all of them, you know, it's just the job of being a president is so hard. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6219.4s)]
*  I used to say I want Hillary to win because I want a woman to be president. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6225.4s)]
*  So I realized they can't fucking do that job either. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6228.4s)]
*  Nobody does that job right. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6230.4s)]
*  Everybody fucks it up. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6232.4s)]
*  Nobody ever gets it right. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6233.4s)]
*  It's always just a disaster. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6234.4s)]
*  Everybody, half the country at least hates you. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6236.4s)]
*  The other giant percentages of the population, even on your team, are disappointing you because you didn't do exactly what they want you to do. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6238.4s)]
*  We've got a we've got a pretty good group of legislators in Alaska. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6246.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6250.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6251.4s)]
*  For the most part, they're all, you know, we're going to have their squabbles and stuff, but pretty much everybody on the same page. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6252.4s)]
*  I think you guys are different humans. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6258.4s)]
*  Alaska is just more durable, reliable people because you have to deal with the cold and you got bears and moose and shit running around up there. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6260.4s)]
*  I think you make it makes different people when you live in the same neighborhood as grizzly bears. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6268.4s)]
*  It just makes everything a little different. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6273.4s)]
*  Yeah, it actually does. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6275.4s)]
*  And the people are generally nice to each other and considerate. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6277.4s)]
*  Well, but they seem more like I said, more robust. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6283.4s)]
*  When I was in Anchorage, we we me and my friend Ari went up there, did some shows, did a little fishing. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6288.4s)]
*  We're like, these people are like better people. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6294.4s)]
*  They're like more solid, like everybody, even just like the regular people hanging out at the bar. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6296.4s)]
*  They like had their shit together more. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6301.4s)]
*  And then we're both like, I guess they kind of have to because otherwise you freeze to death. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6303.4s)]
*  You can't just be a fuck off up here. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6307.4s)]
*  It's too goddamn cold. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6309.4s)]
*  And you can't just go wander in the woods. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6311.4s)]
*  You'll get eaten. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6313.4s)]
*  You fucking your food, Jack. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6315.4s)]
*  You can't go too far. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6317.4s)]
*  Stay close. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6319.4s)]
*  Stay with your people. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6320.4s)]
*  Support each other. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6321.4s)]
*  Someone has a flat tire. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6322.4s)]
*  Fucking help him. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6323.4s)]
*  All right, because you would want to get help, too. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6324.4s)]
*  You could die out there. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6326.4s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6328.4s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6329.4s)]
*  I used to always think that if I go bear hunting, I'm going to go with somebody who I can outrun. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6330.4s)]
*  But now I get a lot of people asking me if I want to go bear run. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6335.4s)]
*  No. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6338.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6341.4s)]
*  You could be in the wrong spot. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6342.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter who's running fast. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6344.4s)]
*  That bear is going to get somebody or all of you, depending upon what's going on. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6346.4s)]
*  But that's a dangerous kind of hunting. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6350.4s)]
*  You're hunting something that's like the apex predator of North America. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6353.4s)]
*  And you don't even eat it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6357.4s)]
*  I have a bunch of friends who go grizzly hunting. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6359.4s)]
*  And the way they put it, like, first of all, you have to control the populations. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6361.4s)]
*  Like, if you don't, you get a situation that's happening like in Montana where they want to list them. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6364.4s)]
*  But they've been delisted for so long. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6369.4s)]
*  The only place you can hunt grizzly bears in America is Alaska. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6372.4s)]
*  And a lot of people that live in Montana don't think that's good. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6375.4s)]
*  They think they should put them back on the list because there's way too many human interactions. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6378.4s)]
*  I have a grizzly bear hide I got from Slingsby up in Nome. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6385.4s)]
*  And it's on that 1885 pool table that I told you. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6390.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6394.4s)]
*  Brunswick. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6395.4s)]
*  I'm not going to play on that pool table until you show up. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6396.4s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6398.4s)]
*  It covers that pool table. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6399.4s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6400.4s)]
*  Got two of those now. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6401.4s)]
*  They're big animals, man. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6403.4s)]
*  Especially the coastal ones. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6405.4s)]
*  Have you ever seen one, one of the coastal ones up close? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6407.4s)]
*  Not grizzly bears. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6410.4s)]
*  I've seen polar bears and stuff like that. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6411.4s)]
*  You've seen polar bears up there? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6413.4s)]
*  Well, not in Fairbanks. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6414.4s)]
*  I've seen north of Nome. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6416.4s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6417.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6418.4s)]
*  They have them up there. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6419.4s)]
*  I mean, they had one polar bear, apparently, I don't know if it's true or not, that walked [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6420.4s)]
*  into the interior of Alaska. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6424.4s)]
*  I mean, it just went traveling. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6425.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6427.4s)]
*  It's going to have me a little cross-country jaunt. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6428.4s)]
*  Fuck running into that thing. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6430.4s)]
*  Well, they eat nothing but meat. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6434.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6436.4s)]
*  They're badass motherfuckers. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6437.4s)]
*  They're the most badass of all of them. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6439.4s)]
*  They are just 100% predator. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6441.4s)]
*  The sketchiest bear to be around. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6445.4s)]
*  There's this video I was watching of these guys the other day that were in a truck. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6447.4s)]
*  And they were filming this polar bear as it just kept getting closer and closer. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6452.4s)]
*  Then they started panicking. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6456.4s)]
*  Okay, it's like 30 yards away, like that sprinting distance. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6457.4s)]
*  We've got to get in the truck. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6460.4s)]
*  And they got in the truck and the polar bear just climbed on top of the truck. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6461.4s)]
*  And he was like, we've got to start the truck and get the fuck out of here. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6464.4s)]
*  This thing's going to break the glass. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6468.4s)]
*  They're bad. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6470.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6471.4s)]
*  You don't want to fuck with them. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6472.4s)]
*  That's just a can of meat to them. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6474.4s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about you. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6476.4s)]
*  You're just food. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6477.4s)]
*  They live in a frozen wasteland. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6478.4s)]
*  Anything that's moving around is edible. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6480.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6482.4s)]
*  Last time... [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6483.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6484.4s)]
*  Look at these guys. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6485.4s)]
*  Bro, don't do that. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6486.4s)]
*  Do not do that. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6488.4s)]
*  Please don't do that. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6490.4s)]
*  That's so dangerous. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6492.4s)]
*  That's not your friend. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6494.4s)]
*  That thing just wants to eat you. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6495.4s)]
*  Isn't it so weird? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6497.4s)]
*  Isn't it so weird? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6498.4s)]
*  It's so not worried about people because it's not threatened by anything because it's such [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6499.4s)]
*  a top dog that it just like will just wander right up to your building. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6503.4s)]
*  Hey, what's inside? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6507.4s)]
*  I smell meat. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6509.4s)]
*  I want to come in that building. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6510.4s)]
*  I'm hungry. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6512.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6513.4s)]
*  I talked about pool. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6514.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6515.4s)]
*  What's that? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6516.4s)]
*  Last time you and I were talking, you said you had a friend that makes pool cues. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6517.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6519.4s)]
*  Here's a chunk of mammoth I reform. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6520.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6522.4s)]
*  This is my buddy, Eric Crisp. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6523.4s)]
*  He makes sugar tree cues. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6525.4s)]
*  This is beautiful, man. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6528.4s)]
*  That's good solid chunk. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6530.4s)]
*  That's a chunk of mammoth ivory. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6531.4s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6533.4s)]
*  The exterior on that, the blue color is called vivianite. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6534.4s)]
*  It comes from mineralization on frozen artifacts like that. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6538.4s)]
*  I'm going to send him this and tell him to turn this into a masterpiece. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6541.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6545.4s)]
*  He makes incredible pool cues and he does use mammoth ivory. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6546.4s)]
*  He uses it sometimes in the joint. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6550.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6552.4s)]
*  You said you had one that had mammoth ivory in it. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6553.4s)]
*  What is that, Jamie? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6556.4s)]
*  Vivianite. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6558.4s)]
*  Vivianite? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6559.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6560.4s)]
*  God, that's so beautiful. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6561.4s)]
*  That's the mineralization you see on that. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6564.4s)]
*  It's actually easy to find bones sometimes because they're colored blue. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6567.4s)]
*  Really? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6571.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6572.4s)]
*  From mineralization. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6573.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6574.4s)]
*  I have some that are really, really blue. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6575.4s)]
*  That bison, the step bison skull that you gave me, that thing freaks people out. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6577.4s)]
*  How old is that? [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6584.4s)]
*  Well, we have to get it tested, but it could be 10,000 years old. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6585.4s)]
*  It could be 40,000 years old. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6588.4s)]
*  The one that was found over the hill from us was 38,000 years old. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6590.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6593.4s)]
*  I haven't tested any of my step bisons. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6594.4s)]
*  It's 400 bucks a pop. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6596.4s)]
*  I would bet that one's at least 20,000, 30,000 years old. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6600.4s)]
*  Whenever I have anybody on that's an ancient history expert that's interested in some of [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6605.4s)]
*  the lost civilization guys, we always talk about your place. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6611.4s)]
*  Because I'm like, that's a place where it seems like that's evidence that something [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6615.4s)]
*  took place there that killed everything all at once. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6619.4s)]
*  Something came in hot, dude. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6622.4s)]
*  Something came in hot. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6623.4s)]
*  And the way you describe it, too, that there's a layer of carbon where it looks like scorched [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6624.4s)]
*  earth. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6629.4s)]
*  It's like burnt gravel, deep, deep, 50 feet down. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6630.4s)]
*  And since we talked last, I think I kind of figured some things out. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6635.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6640.4s)]
*  All that material that has ended up where we're at came in, I think we talked about, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6641.4s)]
*  it came in some kind of water event. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6646.4s)]
*  Some flood. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6649.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6650.4s)]
*  And that's called the back channel to the pay, what we're digging up pay out of. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6651.4s)]
*  So there's a back channel that goes through that valley that's pretty decent and gold. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6657.4s)]
*  I mean, pretty rich. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6662.4s)]
*  And the miners used to drift mine that because they couldn't bucket line dredge it. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6664.4s)]
*  And so it goes around where we're at and keeps going downstream. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6668.4s)]
*  So when we moved from where we were at down to let's go find the back channel, we set [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6672.4s)]
*  up over here where we started on the left limit. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6678.4s)]
*  We started going back up and we found some drift mines up there. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6681.4s)]
*  And this bone here, I think it was from an old drift mine a couple hundred years ago, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6685.4s)]
*  you know, that before the discoveries were made, some guys were out there digging around [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6691.4s)]
*  and had an old drift mine going. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6696.4s)]
*  Yeah, because what did you date this to? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6698.4s)]
*  That's 200 years old. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6700.4s)]
*  And this is what kind of an animal? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6701.4s)]
*  Step bison. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6703.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6704.4s)]
*  Either step bison or could be bear. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6705.4s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6707.4s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6708.4s)]
*  They were around 200 years ago. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6709.4s)]
*  You think that was a bear? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6710.4s)]
*  I'm not, I don't know. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6712.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6714.4s)]
*  Imagine the size of that fucking thing. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6715.4s)]
*  Like that's his shin. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6718.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6720.4s)]
*  You got some experts in here and they'll tell you what it is. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6721.4s)]
*  We call that the spitzer bone. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6725.4s)]
*  Next time I got a biologist in here, I'll say, what do you think that comes from? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6727.4s)]
*  It would have to be a very specific kind of biologist, right? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6730.4s)]
*  A paleontologist worth his weight. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6734.4s)]
*  I mean, you should know. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6736.4s)]
*  I'm not that. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6738.4s)]
*  How many more things have they discovered in the East River? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6739.4s)]
*  They haven't told me, but there is, I mentioned last time, a research vessel that was out there. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6743.4s)]
*  And in this business, if someone makes a discovery on my property that's significant, they don't talk about it. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6749.4s)]
*  They don't want anybody to know about it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6759.4s)]
*  But there was a discovery made, not by Dirty Water Don or Dan. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6762.4s)]
*  He's still out there and he's found all kinds of stuff. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6768.4s)]
*  He posted on his Instagram stuff that he does find. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6772.4s)]
*  And he's found it in the exact same place that you were told that the museum dumped it off. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6775.4s)]
*  And I posted a letter or part of that report that I was hoping that if somebody, I like people to think, here's where it's located. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6781.4s)]
*  OK, here's where it was dumped. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6793.4s)]
*  And it said at the same point where they dumped it, where AM&H dumped it, is where the New York City Hospital dumped their stuff. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6796.4s)]
*  How hard would it be to go to the hospital and go, look at your records and tell me where you used to dump stuff in the 1940s? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6805.4s)]
*  Just find out. Just ask them. AM&H ain't going to tell us. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6813.4s)]
*  Right. But if you know the location where Dirty Water Don found that stuff, it's got to be in there, right? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6817.4s)]
*  Oh, it's in there. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6822.4s)]
*  Can you go to his Instagram, Jamie? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6823.4s)]
*  So how many different things has he recovered so far? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6825.4s)]
*  I think he's found mammoth and bison and a jawbone. It could be a horse. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6829.4s)]
*  I haven't seen any of it with my own eyes. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6834.4s)]
*  And how much did they supposedly dump in that river? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6837.4s)]
*  50 tons. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6840.4s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6841.4s)]
*  And here's what I was going to tell you. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6842.4s)]
*  Someone with a research vessel with side scanning sonar and all that stuff apparently found something. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6844.4s)]
*  I found a mound in the river. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6851.4s)]
*  It's like a hundred, Drew probably knows better than me. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6853.4s)]
*  100 feet long, 40 feet high, 60 feet wide. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6857.4s)]
*  Now that wouldn't be 50 tons, but it could be a whole bunch of other stuff. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6862.4s)]
*  And that's why the report said this will be a significant challenge to future archaeologists. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6869.4s)]
*  This was written in 49 to future archaeologists. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6876.4s)]
*  And I'm going, wait, archaeologists are human things. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6880.4s)]
*  We're talking about paleontology, which is bone things. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6884.4s)]
*  But AM&H is the one that called it archaeological exploration. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6889.4s)]
*  So do they have human bones as well? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6893.4s)]
*  Hypothetically. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6899.4s)]
*  Hypothetically. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6900.4s)]
*  So hypothetically on your property, they found human bones too and just dumped them in the river? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6901.4s)]
*  If you... [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6906.4s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6907.4s)]
*  Why don't they come clean with the saber-toothed tigers? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6911.4s)]
*  What do you mean by come clean with the saber-toothed tigers? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6914.4s)]
*  Well, the experts out there will tell you that saber-toothed tigers weren't found in Alaska. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6917.4s)]
*  But you have found saber-toothed tiger skulls. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6922.4s)]
*  Well, so have they. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6924.4s)]
*  I have a correspondence posted recently, two pages, that's filled with unbelievable things that... [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6926.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's one right there. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6938.4s)]
*  That's Dirty Water Don says that this is the lower jawbone to a step bison. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6939.4s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6944.4s)]
*  He's got some other stuff in there too, right, Jamie? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6945.4s)]
*  Like maybe a tusk or something, some other things? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6947.4s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6951.4s)]
*  Yeah, look at that bone. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6952.4s)]
*  Step bison, tibia. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6953.4s)]
*  So, what are you saying though? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6956.4s)]
*  Why would they dump off human remains? [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6961.4s)]
*  They say that... well, the letter says we have yet to find any human remains. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6967.4s)]
*  But we found spear tips. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6973.4s)]
*  We found mammoth bones with spear tips in them. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6976.4s)]
*  We found that stuff. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6979.4s)]
*  Do you have a photo of a mammoth bone with a spear tip in it? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6981.4s)]
*  Yeah, my daughter's... [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6984.4s)]
*  Hold up a big mammoth hip bone and it's got a spear... [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6985.4s)]
*  Where's that? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6988.4s)]
*  Bone Restor, Alaska. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6990.4s)]
*  No, but where can we see that image? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6991.4s)]
*  On my page. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6994.4s)]
*  On your page. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6995.4s)]
*  Do you have that thing with the spear tip still in it? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6996.4s)]
*  Spear tip's out, but we have the bone. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=6999.4s)]
*  We have a couple bones like that, Joe. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7001.4s)]
*  Watch, take it out. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7003.4s)]
*  In fact, I posted a picture of 12 spear points that were sent to AM&H that disappeared. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7004.4s)]
*  Shit disappeared. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7012.4s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7014.4s)]
*  I was talking to a guy the other day about this, and he was saying that he thinks what happens is, Dan Richards, that it goes to wealthy people. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7015.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7022.4s)]
*  That wealthy people offer them a bunch of money, wealthy donors. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7023.4s)]
*  They want to get it for their collection. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7027.4s)]
*  And he was talking about a bunch of different stuff that goes missing. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7030.4s)]
*  I have a letter I just posted here just in case we wanted to talk about it. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7034.4s)]
*  From Childs Frick, who was head of AM&H back when this was all going on. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7039.4s)]
*  His dad was Henry Frick. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7043.4s)]
*  His dad was the most hated man in America for a while for killing his people. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7045.4s)]
*  He was a steel guy, a steel industry founder. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7049.4s)]
*  Killing his workers? [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7053.4s)]
*  Yeah, they wanted overtime pay, and they didn't want to work so hard. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7055.4s)]
*  He brought in the gang, those hired thugs, the Pinkertons, or whoever it was. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7058.4s)]
*  And murdered people? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7066.4s)]
*  I don't know how many they killed of his guys. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7067.4s)]
*  He was ruthless. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7070.4s)]
*  Henry Frick was ruthless. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7072.4s)]
*  And his kid Childs was the one that set this deal up, this tripartite agreement, which is also included in this letter, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7074.4s)]
*  about AM&H's responsibility with these bones was to just take those of scientific value and do a report on every one they took. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7081.4s)]
*  They took over 40 years. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7090.4s)]
*  They took tons and tons and tons of them. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7093.4s)]
*  Did no reporting. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7095.4s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7096.4s)]
*  Dumped 50 tons in the river because they didn't have a place to store them apparently. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7097.4s)]
*  They didn't care. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7102.4s)]
*  But why would they dump human bones? [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7104.4s)]
*  Because I would think that that would be very valuable. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7106.4s)]
*  You're saying archaeology, so you think it's just spear tips and shit like that? [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7109.4s)]
*  They found human bones, I'm willing to say that. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7116.4s)]
*  They found them. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7119.4s)]
*  It would also be very confusing if you found Alaskan spear tips in the East River. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7121.4s)]
*  That would be the confusing thing for archaeologists, I would imagine. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7127.4s)]
*  They're saying to kind of, right? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7130.4s)]
*  Well, you find a bone with a spear tip in it, or a bone that obviously had a spear tip in it because of the way it's broken. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7132.4s)]
*  I mean, I have a baby mammoth hip bone that is like that. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7141.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7144.4s)]
*  Identified by reputable paleontologists. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7145.4s)]
*  Here's just a for instance I stumbled across, New York Times article talking about. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7149.4s)]
*  Unearthing the secret of New York's mass graves. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7153.4s)]
*  Back from since the 19th century. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7156.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7158.4s)]
*  Hiring prisoners for 50 cents an hour to jail inmates paid to move mass graves. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7159.4s)]
*  There would have been no markings of who was what. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7164.4s)]
*  Oh, so they dumped that in the river too? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7166.4s)]
*  Look where it is. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7169.4s)]
*  They just dumped the bodies in the river. How gross. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7171.4s)]
*  They didn't use coffins until recently. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7175.4s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7177.4s)]
*  What about vampires? [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7178.4s)]
*  Well, I mean they put them in stuff but like a real nice box. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7179.4s)]
*  Come on man, did you see Dracula? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7184.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7187.4s)]
*  People are gross. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7188.4s)]
*  You know, they've been throwing things in that river forever. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7190.4s)]
*  You know, like most of the world. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7192.4s)]
*  You go around rivers in most of the industrialized world. Those rivers are disgusting. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7194.4s)]
*  Well, our state legislature, I told you last time I was going to go political on this. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7199.4s)]
*  I've got no desire to litigate this thing. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7204.4s)]
*  Litigation just takes a long time. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7207.4s)]
*  Politically, I told you last time we're going to go this route. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7211.4s)]
*  I have a letter I just posted from the Alaska State Legislature to AMNH to return the bones from the Senate majority. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7217.4s)]
*  The guy that wrote that is a fellow by the name of Click Bishop. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7228.4s)]
*  And he was the Senate president signed it with him. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7231.4s)]
*  But Click is a good, honest, decent gold mining legislator. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7236.4s)]
*  He was termed out this time and decided not to run again because I suspect he'll run for governor here and he'll probably win in a couple years. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7242.4s)]
*  And Click is one of those guys that wants the bone back. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7249.4s)]
*  We met with him and his chief of staff, the president of the university and the museum guys and some other state legislators. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7254.4s)]
*  And we want him back. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7262.4s)]
*  This is very interesting. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7269.4s)]
*  We understand there are unopened crates sitting in storage in New York. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7272.4s)]
*  They present an opportunity for further scientific discovery in fields such as paleontology, ecology and anthropology. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7276.4s)]
*  Therefore, facilitating the return of this collection is crucial to ensure access for researchers, educators and students within Alaska, thereby advancing scientific knowledge and understanding of the state's natural history. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7283.4s)]
*  There are researchers in Alaska ready and waiting to open these crates that have been collecting dust in your basement. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7294.4s)]
*  Yeah. Get at it. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7301.4s)]
*  Give up the boxes. Yeah. Yeah. Bring them home. Bring them home. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7304.4s)]
*  Well, I made the offer to build a research facility, store everything. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7309.4s)]
*  We'll bring them all back here. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7315.4s)]
*  The scientists can have access to them, but the bones are not leaving Alaska. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7317.4s)]
*  They're not leaving Alaska. You don't trust them anymore. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7322.4s)]
*  Fuck no. Why would you? Why would I? Why would I? I don't. It shouldn't. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7324.4s)]
*  And I get a lot of people. Oh, I need a mammoth bone for my studies. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7328.4s)]
*  You're just trying to collect something. Yeah. Fuck off. I'll never get it back. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7333.4s)]
*  Come on up and find it. Yeah. You know, come find them. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7337.4s)]
*  They're you know, they're all over the place. That's what's nuts is that you keep finding them. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7340.4s)]
*  Like, what was that event like that led so many bodies to be in this small area? [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7343.4s)]
*  Because you said it's only like five acres or something like that. 2.1. 2.1. Yeah, we had maybe a point, another point one. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7349.4s)]
*  But there's another area that you said that's a little larger. Yes. Downstream makes this one look like a piker. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7356.4s)]
*  How big is that area? It's a mile long. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7362.4s)]
*  Whoa. This is on your finding them there, too. Oh, yeah. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7365.4s)]
*  So this main area we're pulling most of this stuff is only 2.1 acres. Yeah. That's crazy. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7369.4s)]
*  That is what a dump of bodies it must have been. Yeah, it was incredible. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7375.4s)]
*  So when we started back down at the mouth and headed up the left limit, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7381.4s)]
*  we hit some fairly modern day drift mines on that side until we got farther up [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7386.4s)]
*  and we went all the way up to where we had been set up before and we crossed back over [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7391.4s)]
*  tracing this back channel because that's where the gold was. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7395.4s)]
*  We didn't get maybe 50 feet and we find any steel tubes sticking out of the ground. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7399.4s)]
*  Well, that's how they used to melt permafrost. But this is virgin ground. It would never been mined. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7405.4s)]
*  So we kept going and we found some pretty significant things over there. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7410.4s)]
*  And we're on the hunt. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7417.4s)]
*  I mean, imagine what the event must have looked like to lead all those bodies in one small area. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7422.4s)]
*  I mean, it only makes sense that that was a mass extinction event, right? Am I wrong? [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7428.4s)]
*  It went over thousands of years because we've dated anywhere from 40,000 year old bones [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7434.4s)]
*  to 12,000 year old bones in that deposit. Wow. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7440.4s)]
*  So everything kept dying there. So it might have been multiple events. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7445.4s)]
*  Yeah, might have been. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7450.4s)]
*  Well, that was one of the things they thought about the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, right? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7451.4s)]
*  They think there was multiple times where that happened. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7454.4s)]
*  And then I wonder what the population density was like of animals back then too. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7457.4s)]
*  Because we do have these enormous animals that are very difficult for predators to hunt [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7463.4s)]
*  and they manage to get into large numbers and they can defend themselves. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7467.4s)]
*  Well, if you have a large population of woolly mammoths and bison and step bison [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7471.4s)]
*  and fucking saber-toothed tigers up there, what the fuck did that look like? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7477.4s)]
*  Like if you're finding that many bones, imagine going back in time 30,000 years ago [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7481.4s)]
*  and just being a fly on the wall and seeing what life was like back then. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7486.4s)]
*  Well, we can't seem to find anybody who's willing to come up there and study it. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7490.4s)]
*  You know, I've made all these offers, generous offers. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7494.4s)]
*  Do you think it's because of the restrictions? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7496.4s)]
*  Because they're scared that you're going to own everything and you're going to... [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7497.4s)]
*  Well, two of the employees at AMNH happened to have a conversation with somebody [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7499.4s)]
*  that is related to the state of Alaska or employed by the state of Alaska [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7505.4s)]
*  where they said, we don't want the bones to get into Reeves' hands [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7511.4s)]
*  because they'll lose...the scientific community will no longer have access to them. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7516.4s)]
*  And they're real valuable and we think he's going to sell them. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7522.4s)]
*  Now, the people that he said that to was with some legislatures, university employees, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7527.4s)]
*  and where we were at, you couldn't even count the fucking number of tusks. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7536.4s)]
*  And so here... [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7542.4s)]
*  That's such an ignorant thing to say, because if you're going to sell them, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7543.4s)]
*  you already have way more than you need to sell. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7546.4s)]
*  We're not there to sell tusks. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7549.4s)]
*  I want to figure out...I'm goofball this way. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7552.4s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7557.4s)]
*  Why did 65% of the world's megafauna, or North America, why did it go all extinct all at once? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7559.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7566.4s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7567.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7568.4s)]
*  And they have...in that collection that they didn't dump in the river, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7569.4s)]
*  in my collection was...let's say it's a 2,000 square foot or 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7573.4s)]
*  I got 42 pieces over here. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7581.4s)]
*  They got the rest. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7583.4s)]
*  I'm not going to solve anything with 42 pieces. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7585.4s)]
*  I want it all. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7588.4s)]
*  Put it all back in Alaska, let the state of Alaska study the fuck out of it, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7590.4s)]
*  and we will tell you how the extinction event happened. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7594.4s)]
*  It's been...paleontologists know that. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7598.4s)]
*  But they don't have money. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7601.4s)]
*  They don't really want to put up with the shit they have to do to get it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7603.4s)]
*  You know how hard it is to dig an ice in permafrost? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7607.4s)]
*  Well, I see those hoses you use. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7611.4s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm not digging it. I'm thawing it. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7613.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7615.4s)]
*  Take a scalp...you know how the paleontologists see them on TV with the little scalpel and, you know, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7616.4s)]
*  toothbrush and shit. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7621.4s)]
*  That don't fly around there. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7623.4s)]
*  You got to melt it and get it the hell out of there. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7625.4s)]
*  That's what people criticize for how we do it. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7628.4s)]
*  But if we don't do it, we don't get it. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7631.4s)]
*  We're not going to use mechanical equipment on it because I don't want to destroy it. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7634.4s)]
*  I could strip that old 2.1 acres in two shifts. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7638.4s)]
*  And I'd lose every fucking bone. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7643.4s)]
*  It'd be smashed. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7646.4s)]
*  You run a D-10 across that stuff, it ain't going to survive, man. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7648.4s)]
*  Of course. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7652.4s)]
*  No, the way you're doing it seems like the only way to do it. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7654.4s)]
*  It is the only way to do it. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7656.4s)]
*  It's just all these paleontologists, they're all connected to universities, right? [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7658.4s)]
*  They're all connected that way and they don't want to piss off AM&H because we can't hire... [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7662.4s)]
*  This guy needs our grant money to do what he does or he needs to be our employee. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7667.4s)]
*  Hey, here's one for Elon Musk and his Doge guys. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7673.4s)]
*  Go check into those guys and see where their money goes, the AM&H. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7677.4s)]
*  See where their money goes, the federal grants they get. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7681.4s)]
*  See where that stuff goes. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7685.4s)]
*  Might as well because that's the only way you're going to bring them into heel. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7688.4s)]
*  These guys have been running unfettered forever. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7693.4s)]
*  Nobody checks on it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7698.4s)]
*  The management is horrible. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7699.4s)]
*  Nobody comes in and says, what did you spend that $2 million on? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7701.4s)]
*  I don't know, look at that funny looking bird over there under. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7705.4s)]
*  It's out of control. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7710.4s)]
*  Do you know this for a fact? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7713.4s)]
*  Have you looked into it? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7714.4s)]
*  Do you know how they run or do you just base this on your interactions with them? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7716.4s)]
*  I'm basing on my interactions with them but I will tell you this. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7719.4s)]
*  One of the main people that people say, you need to litigate this. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7723.4s)]
*  You need to sue their ass. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7727.4s)]
*  I'm pretty good at that. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7729.4s)]
*  I've been involved in two of the longest lawsuits in state history and I've won both of them. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7731.4s)]
*  I'm betting hall of fame kind of stuff. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7736.4s)]
*  But the guy that made the deal with me is I can't depose him. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7740.4s)]
*  I can't depose him. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7750.4s)]
*  It's like be deposing a cabbage and a head of lettuce. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7753.4s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7758.4s)]
*  He's like Biden. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7759.4s)]
*  Oh, he's gone? [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7761.4s)]
*  That's what I hear. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7762.4s)]
*  But he's still employed. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7763.4s)]
*  He's still pulling in a pretty good paycheck. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7765.4s)]
*  To me, maybe you do that in the private sector. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7768.4s)]
*  Maybe you do it. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7773.4s)]
*  And I don't know how much money that AMNH gets from the feds but we looked into it a little bit. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7775.4s)]
*  They get some. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7781.4s)]
*  If they don't want to give Alaska, the state of Alaska, if you look at who wrote that letter, it's not John Reeves now. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7783.4s)]
*  It's the state of fucking Alaska. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7789.4s)]
*  And I told you. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7792.4s)]
*  It's the only way to get him back. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7795.4s)]
*  We got to get our politicians up there going, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7797.4s)]
*  And are they willing to do this? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7801.4s)]
*  They just wrote a letter saying what you're supposed to do. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7803.4s)]
*  So what's the next step? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7806.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7807.4s)]
*  We haven't gotten a response from that fucking letter. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7808.4s)]
*  Do they have to respond? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7810.4s)]
*  Apparently not. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7812.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of the problem, right? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7813.4s)]
*  Fuck these guys. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7814.4s)]
*  They're not accountable. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7815.4s)]
*  Fuck them. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7817.4s)]
*  Fuck this dirt tramp up there. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7818.4s)]
*  They're the AMNH. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7819.4s)]
*  They're a prestigious institution that's beyond reproach, sir. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7822.4s)]
*  And I said, I know. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7826.4s)]
*  You know, if you have the politics lined up right and you see the right people where they should be and you got people that want to just do, that's all I want to do is the right thing. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7828.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7837.4s)]
*  Just do the right thing. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7838.4s)]
*  Is the AMNH, is that where you go to see the dinosaurs? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7839.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7841.4s)]
*  Well, do that. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7842.4s)]
*  I think that's cool. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7843.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7844.4s)]
*  Drew and my wife and Laura went to New York to meet with AMNH and they had to stand in the rain for four hours. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7845.4s)]
*  And then wouldn't meet with us. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7854.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7855.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7856.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, you told me this. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7857.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7858.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not surprised. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7859.4s)]
*  You're a problem. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7860.4s)]
*  They'd rather just avoid you than deal with whatever happened when they dumped 50 tons of bones in the East River and they have a bunch more just sitting there. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7861.4s)]
*  What do you think they would discover? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7872.4s)]
*  If you got it all, what would be the best case scenario? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7874.4s)]
*  You got all the bones back. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7877.4s)]
*  Alaska wins. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7879.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7880.4s)]
*  You bring researchers over there. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7881.4s)]
*  They work with you. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7882.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7883.4s)]
*  What do you think they discover? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7884.4s)]
*  They discover why all this megafauna, what happened? [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7885.4s)]
*  Why did the sea levels rise 400 feet all at once? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7889.4s)]
*  What went on here? [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7892.4s)]
*  There's animals that we found they said didn't exist there. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7894.4s)]
*  Now, they haven't amended that even though you found those? [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7898.4s)]
*  That seems crazy to me. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7901.4s)]
*  They're going a little backpedaling now, but what they need to do is put all the pieces of the puzzle on the table and start putting it together. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7903.4s)]
*  So you found, tell me the animals that you found that are there that aren't supposed to be there. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7911.4s)]
*  Sabertooth tigers, one of them, right? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7915.4s)]
*  Dire wolves. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7917.4s)]
*  Dire wolves, wow. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7918.4s)]
*  Badgers. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7919.4s)]
*  Badgers? [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7920.4s)]
*  Badgers. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7921.4s)]
*  They're not supposed to be there? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7922.4s)]
*  We told you elk last time. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7924.4s)]
*  You pointed out there's an island that has some elk on it. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7926.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7928.4s)]
*  But they were planted there. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7929.4s)]
*  They're not. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7930.4s)]
*  Oh, they were? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7931.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7932.4s)]
*  Elk were not known to be up in my neck of the woods. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7933.4s)]
*  Oh, no kidding. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7936.4s)]
*  And moose came in later, but they didn't even know moose was up there in that time. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7937.4s)]
*  We found four of them. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7942.4s)]
*  So moose were up there. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7944.4s)]
*  And there was a transition from grasslands, which is good for the mammoth and the bison and the horses and the caribou, to the woodlands where the browsers could feed the mastodons, the mammoths, or not the mammoths, the other animals that ate that kind of stuff. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7946.4s)]
*  And the carnivores were having a field day. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7965.4s)]
*  They didn't care. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7967.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7968.4s)]
*  Who's eating what? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7969.4s)]
*  Do you think they brought in elk to hunt, or do you think they brought them in just to have them there? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7970.4s)]
*  I think, no, they weren't brought in. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7977.4s)]
*  Check how did elk get on a Fog Knack Island? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7979.4s)]
*  They were brought in there in 1929. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7982.4s)]
*  1929. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7984.4s)]
*  Eight calves moved from Washington. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7985.4s)]
*  Wow, just eight in Washington. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7987.4s)]
*  That makes sense, because they're Roosevelt elk. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7989.4s)]
*  That totally makes sense. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7991.4s)]
*  Roosevelt elk are a larger bodied animal that has smaller antlers than a Rocky Mountain. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7992.4s)]
*  Roosevelt elk in Alaska originated from a transplant of eight calves captured in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State in 1928 and moved to a Fog Knack Island in 1929. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=7998.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8007.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8009.4s)]
*  We find sheds of the antlers. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8010.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8014.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8015.4s)]
*  And those are like thousands of years old. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8016.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8019.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8020.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8021.4s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about elk in this country. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8022.4s)]
*  They came across the bridge. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8024.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8025.4s)]
*  In this country, they used to be everywhere. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8026.4s)]
*  And then people just wiped them out when they had market hunting. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8028.4s)]
*  That's, you know, when they made it illegal to sell wild game, that was the reason for it, because everybody was poor. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8032.4s)]
*  People were just killing everything they could, and they almost wiped them out. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8038.4s)]
*  They wiped out a lot of species. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8042.4s)]
*  Like, elk used to be in every state, and now they're, you know, in a handful. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8044.4s)]
*  They've repopulated them in some areas. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8049.4s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Kentucky, there's been a bunch of success stories of repopulating elk to the point where they can hunt them now. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8051.4s)]
*  But they used to be everywhere, including Texas. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8057.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8060.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8061.4s)]
*  That's the one that had a spear tip in it. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8062.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8064.4s)]
*  Do you have a photo of it with the spear tip in it? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8065.4s)]
*  I have a little video of it. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8067.4s)]
*  Where? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8069.4s)]
*  It's on my phone. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8070.4s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8071.4s)]
*  Find it. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8072.4s)]
*  I want to see it. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8073.4s)]
*  I will. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8075.4s)]
*  I'll find it. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8076.4s)]
*  I would never take that spear point out. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8077.4s)]
*  I'd have that thing on display. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8079.4s)]
*  That is the coolest thing ever. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8080.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8081.4s)]
*  A spear point inside of a mammoth bone? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8082.4s)]
*  It's just stuck right in it. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8084.4s)]
*  Fuck, that's cool. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8085.4s)]
*  I have another picture up there if you want to pull that bison head up. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8086.4s)]
*  The spear point in it, still in it. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8089.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8091.4s)]
*  Right here. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8092.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8093.4s)]
*  By the eyes. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8094.4s)]
*  Where is that? [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8095.4s)]
*  Not that one. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8096.4s)]
*  That was fairly recently, Jamie. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8097.4s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8099.4s)]
*  That I posted it, yeah. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8100.4s)]
*  Without a doubt, Mike. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8103.4s)]
*  You're going the wrong way. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8104.4s)]
*  Well, there's the Trump thing. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8107.4s)]
*  We should go read the comments. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8108.4s)]
*  You're a terrible person. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8111.4s)]
*  Here's Click. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8116.4s)]
*  Bishop. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8117.4s)]
*  He's the senator that sent the letter. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8118.4s)]
*  Shout out to Click. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8120.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8122.4s)]
*  It's in there? [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8124.4s)]
*  Somewhere. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8125.4s)]
*  How often do you post? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8128.4s)]
*  I posted these to make it easier for Jamie to find. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8129.4s)]
*  I'm back months now. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8132.4s)]
*  I was going back to the top of your feed. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8133.4s)]
*  Was it months ago or was it recently? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8135.4s)]
*  Probably in the last week or two. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8137.4s)]
*  Oh. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8140.4s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8141.4s)]
*  I gave you the wrong direction. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8142.4s)]
*  See it anywhere? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8149.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8151.4s)]
*  Look at that skull. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8152.4s)]
*  Yeah, keep going. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8153.4s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8159.4s)]
*  That's a mammoth brain by those sunglasses. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8160.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8162.4s)]
*  That's a brain? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8163.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8164.4s)]
*  Half of one. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8165.4s)]
*  So was that mineralized? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8166.4s)]
*  It was found frozen, dehydrated. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8168.4s)]
*  That's what that looks like? [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8170.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8171.4s)]
*  What did you do with that thing? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8172.4s)]
*  It's in the freezer. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8174.4s)]
*  Right next to the frozen pizza? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8178.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8180.4s)]
*  Go down next to the ice cream. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8181.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a mammoth brain. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8182.4s)]
*  That's 30,000 years old. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8183.4s)]
*  There's another one that got hit by a spear. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8185.4s)]
*  That's a little mammoth. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8187.4s)]
*  That's some fucking penetration right there, Jack. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8188.4s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8192.4s)]
*  But where's the skull? [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8193.4s)]
*  Where's the skull? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8195.4s)]
*  Oh, there it is right there. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8196.4s)]
*  Where? [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8197.4s)]
*  Right smack dab in the middle. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8198.4s)]
*  That one? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8199.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8200.4s)]
*  Where's the point? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8201.4s)]
*  Right by the arrow. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8202.4s)]
*  Right by the arrow? [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8203.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8204.4s)]
*  Go up right there. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8205.4s)]
*  Where? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8206.4s)]
*  Where the cursor was. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8207.4s)]
*  Right there. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8209.4s)]
*  Right there. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8210.4s)]
*  Right there. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8211.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8212.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8213.4s)]
*  Go where the cursor was. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8214.4s)]
*  Right there. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8215.4s)]
*  That's a tip? [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8216.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8217.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8218.4s)]
*  So it's kind of mineralized too. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8219.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8221.4s)]
*  Stuck right in it. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8222.4s)]
*  Welded to its face. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8223.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8224.4s)]
*  How did you know that that's what that was? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8228.4s)]
*  It looks like a tumor to me. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8230.4s)]
*  Did you have to clean it up to see the difference? [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8232.4s)]
*  It's been cleaned up quite a bit. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8235.4s)]
*  It's not bone. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8237.4s)]
*  It's stone. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8238.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8239.4s)]
*  And you're going to leave it in there like that? [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8240.4s)]
*  Yep. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8242.4s)]
*  Did you get an x-ray of it or anything so you could see it? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8243.4s)]
*  No. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8246.4s)]
*  Oh, I'd want to see that. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8247.4s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8249.4s)]
*  What is it like being on a piece of land that at one point in time was just like this insane [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8251.4s)]
*  habitat? [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8257.4s)]
*  I mean, it must have like some bizarre feel to just the land itself when you're pulling [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8258.4s)]
*  out saber-toothed tiger skulls and woolly mammoth tusks. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8263.8s)]
*  And it just must feel insane that you're pulling all this stuff out of the ground that you [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8267.4s)]
*  live on. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8272.0s)]
*  Well, we live in the Ice Age. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8273.0s)]
*  We go to work in the morning. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8275.0s)]
*  We're in the Ice Age. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8277.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8278.0s)]
*  It's a different way to think. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8279.0s)]
*  You see something, you go, okay, what the fuck? [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8281.0s)]
*  What is this? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8286.0s)]
*  You find something, you go, that's not human. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8289.0s)]
*  I mean, that tool was made by a human. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8294.0s)]
*  If you go back to that... [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8298.0s)]
*  But also if you find humans, you gotta hug and keep it on the DL. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8299.0s)]
*  I think so. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8303.0s)]
*  I would imagine. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8304.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8305.0s)]
*  I don't know either. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8306.0s)]
*  I don't know nothing. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8307.0s)]
*  But I would imagine if I found some humans, I wouldn't tell nobody. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8308.0s)]
*  Well, we found that one tool that was obviously shaped by humans. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8311.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8315.0s)]
*  It's carbon dated 25,000 years old. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8316.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8319.0s)]
*  And it looks like it was sawed. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8320.0s)]
*  And it looks just like if I was to take this cup, you hold it in your hand, just like something [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8322.0s)]
*  to mash anything with. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8331.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8333.0s)]
*  Like a mortar and pestle. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8334.0s)]
*  Tenderized, there it is right there. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8335.0s)]
*  Is that it right there? [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8336.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8337.0s)]
*  So that's a stone tool. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8338.0s)]
*  No, that's mammoth bone. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8339.0s)]
*  Mammoth bone. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8340.0s)]
*  But if you look on the next picture... [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8341.0s)]
*  So the bottom of that thing was, oh wow, that's 25,000 years old. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8342.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8346.0s)]
*  And it's sawed off at the bottom. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8347.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8348.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8349.0s)]
*  And you can see, there's some kind of organic material in some of those cracks and crevices. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8350.0s)]
*  And you see some Schrager lines in there. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8355.0s)]
*  What is a Schrager line? [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8359.0s)]
*  Does that mean like saw? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8360.0s)]
*  That's a line in the mammoth ivory that's different than elephant ivory. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8361.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8365.0s)]
*  You can tell the difference. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8366.0s)]
*  And this was probably sawed off a long time ago, and now it's kind of fossilized, right? [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8368.0s)]
*  Without any prompting, Joe, I've given that thing to other people to hold. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8377.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8384.0s)]
*  You know, it's like that. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8385.0s)]
*  They pick it up, it's the first thing they fucking do. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8387.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8391.0s)]
*  It's like, I know what this is. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8392.0s)]
*  So it's a tool. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8394.0s)]
*  Everybody picks it up. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8396.0s)]
*  Well, whatever it is... [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8397.0s)]
*  It fits perfectly in your hand. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8398.0s)]
*  It certainly seems like humans made it. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8399.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8402.0s)]
*  There's no way you get something that's that flat out of nature. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8403.0s)]
*  And it's not like those things snap off. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8406.0s)]
*  They're not like elk antlers. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8408.0s)]
*  They don't regrow them, right? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8409.0s)]
*  Well, the other thing is, I said this last time, I'll say it again. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8411.0s)]
*  We've lived with woolly mammoths for tens of thousands of years. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8416.0s)]
*  We know what that thing, what that tool is. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8421.0s)]
*  It's in our DNA. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8425.0s)]
*  First thing we do when we pick it up, boom, boom, boom. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8427.0s)]
*  We don't feel like that about rats. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8430.0s)]
*  People go, ugh. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8433.0s)]
*  Woolly mammoth. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8435.0s)]
*  Little kids love them. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8436.0s)]
*  Parents love them. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8438.0s)]
*  Everybody likes woolly mammoths. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8439.0s)]
*  You think it's our DNA because we used to hunt them? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8441.0s)]
*  Fuck, no. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8443.0s)]
*  We live with them. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8444.0s)]
*  I think we domesticated them. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8445.0s)]
*  What? [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8446.0s)]
*  I think we've lived side by side with them. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8447.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8449.0s)]
*  I really do. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8450.0s)]
*  Why do you think they domesticated them? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8451.0s)]
*  What makes you think that? [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8452.0s)]
*  Okay, you got a big hairy animal. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8453.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8455.0s)]
*  Boy, they got some, like musk ox. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8456.0s)]
*  Let's get some of this and make clothing out of it. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8459.0s)]
*  Let's take this fur. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8461.0s)]
*  Right, but why that, why domesticate them versus hunt them? [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8464.0s)]
*  You hunt them with a spear. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8468.0s)]
*  I mean, you can knock one over if it's dead or you stick a spear in it. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8470.0s)]
*  You cripple. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8474.0s)]
*  But do you think they actually kept them as like stock? [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8475.0s)]
*  No, I think they just lived together. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8478.0s)]
*  They just lived together. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8479.0s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8480.0s)]
*  It's like that polar bear you saw walking up that guy's truck. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8481.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8483.0s)]
*  That one man would go, what the fuck? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8484.0s)]
*  He can do to me. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8485.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8486.0s)]
*  Well, if you want to kill half your tribe, go try to stick a spear in that guy. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8487.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8492.0s)]
*  He's got 10 foot tusks. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8493.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8494.0s)]
*  And they're huge. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8495.0s)]
*  He'll clear the field. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8496.0s)]
*  And also, you got to penetrate all that fur and all that hide. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8497.0s)]
*  With a spear. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8502.0s)]
*  With a spear that you're throwing. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8503.0s)]
*  And people go, well, they had atlatl. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8505.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8507.0s)]
*  Where are you going to build an atlatl on a grassland? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8508.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8511.0s)]
*  Where there's no sticks. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8512.0s)]
*  Well, how are they making a spear then? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8513.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8515.0s)]
*  How are they making a spear? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8516.0s)]
*  They must have some sticks. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8517.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8518.0s)]
*  They didn't. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8519.0s)]
*  They had spears. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8520.0s)]
*  If they had wood big enough for a spear, but atlatls are not spear size. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8521.0s)]
*  Well, it's a different shape, certainly. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8526.0s)]
*  But if you have enough wood to make a spear, wouldn't you have enough wood to make an atlatl? [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8528.0s)]
*  I mean, when's the invention of the atlatl? [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8533.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8535.0s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8536.0s)]
*  But if you had a spear that you crafted, and we have a picture of spear tips that were [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8537.0s)]
*  sent to New York, and that other document in there talks about finding them in association [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8543.0s)]
*  with the bones. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8549.0s)]
*  They weren't studying this stuff. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8552.0s)]
*  AM&H just wanted the booty. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8554.0s)]
*  That guy Charles Frick wanted these things back in New York City. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8557.0s)]
*  So here's the atlatl. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8561.0s)]
*  17,000 to 21,000 years ago. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8563.0s)]
*  So if it's 25,000 years ago, it might not even be an atlatl. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8566.0s)]
*  But who knows how accurate they are with this? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8570.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a big gap, 17,000 to 21,000 years ago. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8572.0s)]
*  But this is also people that didn't think that saber-toothed tigers lived in Alaska. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8577.0s)]
*  It's all artists' renditions. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8582.0s)]
*  All of the stuff that we've been taught is based on what somebody painted or drew or sketched. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8584.0s)]
*  Or they initially established, and now they've been defending that timeline. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8590.0s)]
*  Or even some of the cave drawings that shows people sitting on woolly mammoths. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8594.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8598.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen them before online. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8599.0s)]
*  If you believe everything you see. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8601.0s)]
*  Like when Ted Nugent rode that buffalo on stage? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8603.0s)]
*  Like that kind of thing? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8605.0s)]
*  That was good. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8606.0s)]
*  But that kind of thing. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8607.0s)]
*  They domesticated them. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8609.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8612.0s)]
*  Well, we know humans have domesticated elephants. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8614.0s)]
*  And they did it a long time ago, and they rode elephants. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8616.0s)]
*  We know they do it in India. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8619.0s)]
*  Yeah, you rode them. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8620.0s)]
*  Yeah, I rode them in Thailand. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8621.0s)]
*  I don't recommend it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8623.0s)]
*  It just seems like it'd go wrong. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8625.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that'll be part of my thing. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8628.0s)]
*  Yeah, you make friends with them first. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8631.0s)]
*  They have a whole process you do. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8633.0s)]
*  You feed them. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8634.0s)]
*  You give them sugar cane. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8635.0s)]
*  You hose them down. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8636.0s)]
*  Take care of them. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8638.0s)]
*  You be nice to them first. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8639.0s)]
*  And then they let you ride them. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8641.0s)]
*  But you've got to be nice to them even when you're riding them. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8642.0s)]
*  You have to have good energy. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8644.0s)]
*  I don't think they necessarily enjoy having a little fucking human on their back. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8646.0s)]
*  So it's like it's their world. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8651.0s)]
*  It just seems like a dumb idea. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8653.0s)]
*  Like I'm happy just petting you and giving you food. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8655.0s)]
*  I don't need to ride you. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8658.0s)]
*  This is pretty badass looking. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8659.0s)]
*  Is that an atlatl? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8660.0s)]
*  I think this might be the one they found in a cave in France. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8661.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8665.0s)]
*  Antler, a crocodile antler. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8666.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8668.0s)]
*  Who's a wizard that figured out how to make something to put extra leverage on a spear? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8669.0s)]
*  His name was Hook Musk. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8675.0s)]
*  That's the other thing that Dan Richards was bringing up. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8677.0s)]
*  Like the fact that bow and arrow is a difficult thing to invent, but yet they invented it all over the world. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8680.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8686.0s)]
*  Or were people traveling from all over the world with the technology of the bow and arrow and spreading it around the world? [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8687.0s)]
*  He said that might make more sense than all these people from all these different spots all figuring out this complicated thing where you get a thing, you pull it back, you got a string, and you're letting loose. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8693.0s)]
*  And the arrow has to fly perfect. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8703.0s)]
*  More likely someone figured it out in some place and it was so awesome that they started spreading that idea across the world. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8706.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8714.0s)]
*  And it takes a while back then to get the word out. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8717.0s)]
*  I mean people had to travel to spread the word. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8718.0s)]
*  They didn't, I don't think they had smoke signals so they could explain it in the sky. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8720.0s)]
*  I don't think you'd be able to explain a bow and arrow in the sky with smoke signals. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8725.0s)]
*  I'm willing to go on a limb on that. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8728.0s)]
*  We come up with the expression the cloud. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8730.0s)]
*  We use the cloud now. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8732.0s)]
*  Yeah that was the original cloud, smoke clouds. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8735.0s)]
*  But I mean what did they send, did they have a code when they had smoke signals? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8737.0s)]
*  Or was it just the smoke itself? [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8748.0s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8749.0s)]
*  So you found spear tips, have you found arrow heads as well? [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8750.0s)]
*  Not arrow heads. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8754.0s)]
*  Only spear tips. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8755.0s)]
*  So it's more primitive. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8756.0s)]
*  Yeah and the way we collect, we don't get all the small stuff, but we bail all the small stuff out of the drainage and we stack it so it can be gotten later. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8757.0s)]
*  We don't lose any of it. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8768.0s)]
*  But you might have a bunch of spear heads just laying around. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8770.0s)]
*  I bet we have millions of what I call microfossils. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8773.0s)]
*  Millions. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8777.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8778.0s)]
*  And the stuff that we bail with the equipment and just stack it up. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8779.0s)]
*  When you first discovered the saber tooth tiger head, when was that? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8782.0s)]
*  I found one in 1974. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8788.0s)]
*  That was the first one? [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8790.0s)]
*  Yeah but I was mining up north. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8791.0s)]
*  And when you found that, what was the reaction to that? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8793.0s)]
*  Did it have the teeth in it and everything or was it just... [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8796.0s)]
*  It had one full tooth and one broken half. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8798.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8801.0s)]
*  And I think I told you, the British Museum visited. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8807.0s)]
*  I never got the driver to take it back and clean it and restore it and send it back to me. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8808.0s)]
*  Never saw it again. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8812.0s)]
*  Of course. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8813.0s)]
*  The one that was sent to the... [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8814.0s)]
*  How fucking gross is that? [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8815.0s)]
*  That they just keep doing that same shit. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8817.0s)]
*  They do it all. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8819.0s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8821.0s)]
*  In the last year or two... [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8822.0s)]
*  Why should you have it? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8823.0s)]
*  This is important for humanity. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8824.0s)]
*  Some dirty gold miner. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8826.0s)]
*  The Smithsonian. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8828.0s)]
*  Ammonage got in trouble for grave robbing. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8830.0s)]
*  Most museums have done that. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8834.0s)]
*  They've taken artifacts from cultures and they just keep them. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8836.0s)]
*  So these people, they found this saber... they got this saber tiger. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8839.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8842.0s)]
*  Look at that one. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8843.0s)]
*  That's a cave lion skull that we found. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8844.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8846.0s)]
*  Was that supposed to be there? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8847.0s)]
*  The cave lion? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8849.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8850.0s)]
*  That's the best one I've ever found in Alaska. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8851.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8854.0s)]
*  My son Kenzie and I found that together. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8855.0s)]
*  Fucking A. That thing's amazing. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8857.0s)]
*  Look at the teeth on that thing. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8860.0s)]
*  So this saber tooth skull is probably very valuable that you found. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8863.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8868.0s)]
*  Because I've seen them for sale. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8869.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8871.0s)]
*  And AMH says they don't have one, but we were going through the shipping records and we [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8872.0s)]
*  can see where they were shipped one. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8876.0s)]
*  The correspondence that I just posted talks about them, getting them, and camels, and [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8878.0s)]
*  other things that were sent, somehow disappeared. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8885.0s)]
*  Does Lorenzo Fertitta have a saber tooth skull in his office? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8890.0s)]
*  See if that's true. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8895.0s)]
*  Lorenzo Fertitta is one of the gentlemen who owned the UFC before they sold it to WME. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8896.0s)]
*  Billionaire character, loved MMA, and really was the reason why the UFC blew up, along [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8904.0s)]
*  with Dana White and his brother Frank. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8909.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me see what that looks like. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8911.0s)]
*  I think it's like a lot of money. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8913.0s)]
*  So if you think about your skull and this asshole gets a hold of it, there's probably [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8916.0s)]
*  some asshole over there that's really rich. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8921.0s)]
*  I was offered 85 grand for that one. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8923.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8926.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8927.0s)]
*  Here's one for 500 grand. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8928.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8930.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8931.0s)]
*  Holy shit's right, man. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8934.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8935.0s)]
*  How fucking amazing must that thing have been to see live? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8937.0s)]
*  They got a bunch of Milt La Brea tar pits. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8942.0s)]
*  I mean a bunch. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8945.0s)]
*  How much did Lorenzo Fertitta pay for the one that it's in? [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8947.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8950.0s)]
*  There was this article that had words that didn't have the picture of it. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8951.0s)]
*  Did you Google Lorenzo Fertitta's and see images? [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8954.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that shows me other sabers I can't... [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8957.0s)]
*  What about that article? [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8960.0s)]
*  That first article? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8961.0s)]
*  No picture of it? [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8962.0s)]
*  No picture. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8963.0s)]
*  How dare you, bloody elbow. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8964.0s)]
*  You would think that a website called bloodyelbow.com would really be on top of it. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8965.0s)]
*  It was 15 years old? [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8970.0s)]
*  That's 2010? [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8971.0s)]
*  2012 was when the article was posted. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8972.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8973.0s)]
*  It was $160,000 there. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8974.0s)]
*  What? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8975.0s)]
*  It's only 160 grand? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8976.0s)]
*  Fossilized saber tooth types. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8977.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was like millions. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8978.0s)]
*  Could be small too, I don't know. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8979.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what that one that was sold at the auction went for. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8984.0s)]
*  How fucking cool are those things though, man? [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8988.0s)]
*  Like what a wild, amazing design that nature created. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8990.0s)]
*  This is a whole skeleton? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8995.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8998.0s)]
*  40 million years old, it says. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=8999.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9003.0s)]
*  How many of you found up there saber tooth skulls? [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9004.0s)]
*  Two. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9011.0s)]
*  Just two? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9012.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9013.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's... when you come up, give me enough of advance notice and maybe send Jamie up [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9014.0s)]
*  in advance and we'll put a little... [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9026.0s)]
*  Jamie never leaves his apartment. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9028.0s)]
*  He's not going to go to Alaska. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9029.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9030.0s)]
*  What's he going to do with Carl? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9031.0s)]
*  Can he bring Carl up there? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9032.0s)]
*  Carl won't survive. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9033.0s)]
*  Carl will get along just fine with our dogs. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9034.0s)]
*  He'll run off. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9035.0s)]
*  We'll put up a good putting green for him. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9036.0s)]
*  He'll attack your dogs. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9037.0s)]
*  He's a little torpedo. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9038.0s)]
*  But put up a... you need to start coming up there in the summer and we'll do some podcasts. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9039.0s)]
*  Is that the move? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9040.0s)]
*  The summertime. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9041.0s)]
*  The summertime. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9042.0s)]
*  Podcasts from Fairbanks, the Bone Crew. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9043.0s)]
*  Bring your friends with you. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9044.0s)]
*  It'd be like Protect Our Parks Only, Parks Only Different. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9045.0s)]
*  Protect Our Parks in Fairbanks, that would be fun. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9046.0s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9047.0s)]
*  That would be a good one. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9048.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would be fun. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9049.0s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9050.0s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9051.0s)]
*  It would be fun. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9052.0s)]

*  such an amazing area that I would think that they would be flocking to try to [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9166.080000000002s)]

*  of how many discoveries you've got. First of all, the proven fact that [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9175.44s)]
*  saber-toothed tigers lived in a place they didn't think they lived, that alone [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9179.04s)]

*  saying Dana bought it from a museum. Holy shit. That's amazing. All right, we'll [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9195.72s)]
*  take a leak. We'll be right back. Dana White got an awesome skull. All right, [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9200.199999999999s)]

*  sure. How long is it? Three months, maybe. Really? God damn. It took 50 years for me to [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9208.56s)]
*  fuck up my lungs, but I'm cleaning them up now. Well, now's the goodest time as [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9215.64s)]

*  and you were telling me you had topics that you wanted to cover, that you brought [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9235.6s)]
*  notes. Well, we were talking about the gas line. Right. Got that going. No, there's no [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9240.56s)]

*  about environmental disasters, right? Yeah, but that oil pipeline has been [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9255.6s)]
*  running for a long time. Provides 12% of our country's gas, oil. No problems. Well, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9259.08s)]
*  we had a problem. You know, fly reef. What was that? Exxon Valdez. Oh, yeah, that was [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9267.2s)]
*  a big problem. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. That was 1988, right? Wasn't it? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9275.52s)]
*  Don't remember the exact date. I think it was, because I remember people were [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9282.44s)]
*  freaking out that that thing wrecked and emptied out a whole oil tanker. 89. Exxon [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9286.92s)]
*  Valdez oil tanker ran aground, fly reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound spill [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9296.42s)]
*  released more than 11 million gallons of crude oil, the largest oil spill in US [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9300.560000000001s)]
*  history at the time. But that's probably not nearly as much as that one that blew [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9304.66s)]
*  out in the ocean that was just spraying oil. Yeah. I mean, that had to be probably [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9308.98s)]
*  more than that. You're talking about the one in the overseas or the one here? The one [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9315.3s)]
*  here. Yes, that one. How much did that release? That's what people are scared of. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9320.1s)]
*  It was continuously releasing oil and natural gas for 87 days. Well, I brought you some goodies. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9327.66s)]
*  What'd you bring? Well, some things that you can remind you of the boneyard. Oh, okay. We [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9336.14s)]
*  make a little bag here for you too, Jimmy. What do you got here, buddy? Stuff. Stuff? Stuff that Drew and I make. Oh, [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9345.5s)]

*  tooth that's been cut, is that the natural color of it? That blue? No, I think he might have put a [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9506.22s)]
*  little coloring in it. Wow, that's beautiful. And the epoxy. Isn't that something? That is [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9510.3s)]

*  would rather have the tooth, but the art work itself is insane. We can arrange that, Joe. Well, [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9648.78s)]
*  I like it by itself too. I like the art too, but it's just like, I just feel weird about people [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9654.86s)]
*  carving into stuff that's so valuable and ancient. I've had him make me one for every animal that we [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9659.58s)]
*  found. He's got them with horses. Jamie, you got to pick this up. Feel how heavy this is. This is so [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9665.34s)]

*  hunters wiped all those out. No way. Spears. Shut the fuck up. No, they, anyways, Chuck has made, [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9698.3s)]
*  for every animal that we found out there, he's made a, taken a mammoth tooth and carved the animal [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9705.98s)]
*  inside it just like that mammoth. Oh, wow. Including saber-toothed tigers. Wow. Look at that [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9710.939999999999s)]

*  back right now. I can't seem to find it. One museum stole one and I think the other museum stole one, too. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9720.7s)]
*  So one museum stole one. The British Museum stole one. The one where you can't. And AM&H says they never got one. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9730.220000000001s)]
*  But the correspondence that's listing there talks about them being shipped to New York. Talks about [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9736.62s)]
*  the agreement we had with AM&H. Oh, it never got there. Sorry. Otto Geist was a scumbag that [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9743.26s)]
*  collected for him. He was a railroad field hand. Now he ended up with a doctorate in [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9749.82s)]
*  anthropology from the University of Alaska who was in on this whole deal. Well, I would guarantee [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9756.460000000001s)]
*  that if I lived in like 1920 or some shit like that and I knew that one of my buddies that I'd [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9761.34s)]
*  been donating to his museum was about to get a saber-toothed tiger headed and I wanted that for [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9769.26s)]
*  my house. You'd have it. You'd probably make a little deal. Of course you would. Make a little deal. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9773.82s)]
*  I'll give you a million dollars in grants and next thing you know you have people over for a cocktail [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9779.82s)]
*  party. Come into the lounge. I want to show you something I acquired. I have a letter posted of [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9784.460000000001s)]
*  what I consider a pretty interesting way to offer a bribe back in the back in a day. Really? Yeah, [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9791.5s)]
*  it's posted. How did they do the bribe? It was a letter from Charles Frick to the [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9798.14s)]
*  president of the University of Alaska and the sentence that got my attention was, [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9803.66s)]
*  well, first of all he invited him to join him and his wife in New York City for a night at the [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9808.859999999999s)]
*  mansion and then the last sentence was, and we can discuss things that man always needs more of. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9814.38s)]
*  Hmm. Pussy? Well, [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9822.46s)]
*  you don't buy that. You rent that. Goals? What does man need more of? [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9829.9s)]
*  I would say money. Yeah, it has to be that. It has to be he's offering him what man needs more of. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9837.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's a nice way of saying it. Back in the day it was the king's English. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9843.26s)]
*  They talked proper and all that stuff. Yeah. Well, like I said, Dan Richards brought that up, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9848.46s)]
*  that he thinks that that's what happened to a lot of ancient Egyptian artifacts and they're [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9854.539999999999s)]
*  probably scattered all over the country, or over the world rather, in the hands of wealthy collectors. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9858.699999999999s)]
*  Makes sense. You know, people always want to have something that is very rare and that they're not [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9864.22s)]
*  supposed to have. And we don't collect stuff. What do you collect? What's your favorite [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9871.5s)]
*  thing to collect? Pool cues. Pool cues. There you go. I love pool cues. They're functional artwork [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9877.82s)]

*  He's- If he turns it on a lathe or what, I don't know. My friend Eric, he goes out into the woods [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9901.1s)]
*  and gets his own wood. He does everything from the bottom to the final production of it. He's a [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9905.58s)]
*  really rare guy because his cues, he make- There's a lot of cues, they make them real fancy with a [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9912.38s)]
*  bunch of different inlays and different stuff, but what he uses mostly is just the natural beauty of [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9918.86s)]
*  the wood itself. He's like, he loves wood. And so his- Look at that. Look at the burl on that handle. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9924.94s)]

*  And they also play incredible. He's a really good pool player too, which is kind of important if [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9943.02s)]

*  Yeah. And it's like I said, you see how his work, it just really highlights the beauty of the wood [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9959.34s)]
*  itself and they play really good too. That's the thing about pool cues. They all play different, [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9964.380000000001s)]
*  but his, they all have a lot of feel to them. That one right there by your cursor right there, [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9970.460000000001s)]

*  but it's also that the gorgeousness of it is just natural, just natural wood. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9985.5s)]
*  So I'll send him this stuff. He uses a mammoth ivory. I got more if he needs more. I don't know [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=9991.5s)]

*  years ago. Pretty incredible stuff. It is. When you're walking around that area, do you get a [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10067.26s)]
*  sense of it? Like, does it feel weird when you're walking around there? It does because of stink. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10073.5s)]

*  They find bones. They'll come up to our pallets and take bones right off of them. Wow. And they'll [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10095.820000000002s)]

*  wasn't frozen, that's probably what happened to most of the bones that were left behind by all the [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10108.060000000001s)]
*  animals that didn't die in permafrost. Right. We have bones that have tendons still attached. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10111.5s)]

*  38,000 years old. Yeah, they- Talk about dry aged. Yeah. They had a, well, you know, we all eat that [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10126.86s)]
*  shit. He had a stew made out of it. What was it like? I talked to him out of the boneyard. He came [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10133.82s)]
*  out there, he's up in years now, but Dale Guthrie, I believe his name is, and he wrote a book on it, [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10141.66s)]
*  on Ice Age stuff. He made a big old casting of a wooly mammoth that I bought, [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10148.22s)]
*  not from him, but he sold it to somebody who sold it to another guy I knew who had it for sale. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10155.9s)]
*  And he made a stew out of old bison meat. Yeah, they found the whole bison, a mammified bison. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10161.26s)]
*  And if you saw that little- There it is. Wow. Dinner party that served up 50,000 year old [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10168.22s)]
*  bison stew. And I think it's 38,000, but that's all right. Wow. Dale Guthrie, that was the guy's [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10176.54s)]
*  name. I would have had to take a bowl of that. I would have had to try it. When you come on up, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10182.86s)]
*  you come on up, we'll make a- I would try it last. I'd let a bunch of other eggheads try it first [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10189.42s)]
*  and stare at them. How you feeling? What kind of fucking diseases are in that bison bone that you're [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10195.34s)]
*  thawing out now? I'm going to go heavy duty on this carnivore diet. You should. Yeah. Nothing [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10201.42s)]

*  for roughly eight people, Guthrie cut off a small part of the bison's neck where the meat was frozen [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10215.74s)]
*  while fresh. When it thawed, it gave off an unmistakable beef aroma, not unpleasantly mixed [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10221.18s)]
*  with a faint smell of the earth in which it was found with a touch of mushroom, he once wrote. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10226.62s)]
*  They then added a generous amount of garlic and onions along with carrots and potatoes to the aged [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10233.900000000001s)]
*  meat. Couple that with wine and it becomes a full-fledged dinner. Did they show a photo of [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10238.220000000001s)]
*  what the dinner looked like? No, it was in 1984. They didn't take pictures back then? No. How do [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10242.060000000001s)]
*  you not take pictures of your food? I told you the story of the guy that found that. Wow. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10247.58s)]
*  Wow. Not a good, it wasn't a good look. Yeah. But they closed his mine down, they took that out. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10252.54s)]
*  They were supposed to get it out that day and it took them all summer. The miner got shut down. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10264.380000000001s)]
*  Just because of this bison. Yeah. Yeah. He went over to a different creek. I think I told you this, [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10269.580000000002s)]
*  called No Gold Creek. I don't think there's any gold on No Gold Creek. Didn't have a good winter. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10275.580000000002s)]
*  Because he couldn't go to the other place because of the bison. Yeah. That's a pain in the ass. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10282.54s)]
*  Ron Roman's his name. He's a- Was there any other way to do it? Was there a way to work around it? [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10286.62s)]
*  That was the only other ground he had. They tied up the whole thing. I mean, you're done. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10291.5s)]
*  Then when they were done, he went back in. But is it his land? Yeah, it was patented land that he had. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10299.1s)]
*  It was my company land. He was on my ground. And they have the ability to just shut things down [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10305.660000000002s)]
*  for a discovery like that? Yes, they did. How come they don't have the ability- He was a nice guy. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10310.14s)]
*  Oh, he let them do it? He said, we're going to get in here. We'll take us a day to get it out. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10315.74s)]
*  He said, go ahead. I see. And then he said, we can't do this, the whole thing. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10319.74s)]
*  And then they could never get him out of there. They took it out, took him all summer to get it. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10323.58s)]
*  And then it fucked him. Yeah. You only get 100 days to mine where the water turns to ice. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10327.98s)]
*  Right. If you're not mining then, you're done. So every day is a 1% day. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10333.5s)]
*  Oh, that's terrible. Or 10%. It's like every day. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10337.74s)]
*  So that must have been terrible financially for him. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10341.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was horrible. He had nothing but pork and beans all winter. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10343.9s)]
*  He's the one that found the willy mammoth. Is there any other way to mine around that? [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10350.619999999999s)]
*  Were you not going in that one area? If you rely on somebody telling you, [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10355.5s)]
*  what you can and can't do. Look, we'll get back in here. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10360.86s)]
*  You can be back here day after tomorrow. Anybody, any miner that I know would say, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10363.74s)]
*  okay, come do it. I know I'm going to lose a day, but we'll work on equipment that day. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10369.1s)]
*  But if you come back in the day after tomorrow and they say, sorry, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10375.58s)]
*  we're going to be here for a few months. What would you do? [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10379.18s)]
*  I wouldn't tell them I found that fucking thing. Because you have experience with these kind of [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10383.66s)]
*  people. It's not like I'm keeping this discovery a secret. People tell me. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10387.74s)]
*  How many Instagram followers you have? Over 500,000. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10397.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a secret. Let's see how much it is after today too. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10402.46s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you doing this because this gives us an ability to get the word out. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10405.42s)]
*  And it's important to get the word out to get the other things to fall in place. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10410.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important too. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10414.94s)]
*  And I appreciate the fact that you enjoy the shit out of this prehistory stuff, dude. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10416.38s)]
*  I do. I love it. And I also love the way you're handling it. I think we're very fortunate that a [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10421.9s)]
*  guy like you owns that piece where you're willing to talk about it publicly and make a stink about [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10427.259999999998s)]
*  it and let everybody know. There's a real part of the puzzle and the history of this earth [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10432.38s)]
*  that's right there. It's not that even that complicated a puzzle. The puzzling part is, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10438.46s)]
*  what the fuck is Aminage doing? They've had those bones in their basement for a hundred fucking years. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10445.5s)]
*  They were required in the original deal to do a report on every bone they took. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10451.1s)]
*  And they were only supposed to take bones of scientific value. This bone has no scientific [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10456.460000000001s)]
*  value to them. They took it. This bone has no scientific value to them. They took it. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10461.18s)]
*  None of the bones they took have scientific value, primarily because they don't know where [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10466.94s)]
*  they found them. I have all that information in my files. I have all the stratigraphic information [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10471.74s)]
*  of everything they found. Don't you guys think you ought to weld it to me and say, well, this [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10477.74s)]
*  bone came out of 35 feet on Woodchopper Creek, Goldstream Creek, Miller Creek, whatever creek it [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10483.74s)]
*  came off. So you could be able to find the exact locations and where it was dug. Yeah. So let me [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10492.22s)]
*  ask you this. In a best case scenario, what would happen? They would give you the bones back [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10496.86s)]
*  and then what would you do? The experts would come in after I built a facility [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10502.94s)]
*  where they study them. I understand they're not going to, we have a lab in San Francisco. We're [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10507.82s)]
*  going to send the bones to San Francisco. Uh-uh. We'll have a lab here. I'll build the motherfucker. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10514.060000000001s)]
*  I've already offered this up to them and they still don't jump on the chance. How many dumb [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10520.78s)]
*  shits are around like me? Maybe you have to build it first and they will come like the fucking field [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10525.42s)]
*  of dreams. Yeah. That was a movie. By the way, I love that movie. It's a good movie. But I, uh, [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10530.7s)]
*  I've learned my lesson on if you build it, it will come. Yeah. Cause we built, we just built one. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10540.06s)]
*  They didn't show up. So we use it, we use it for our own purposes. Well, maybe we could put the [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10545.9s)]
*  bat signal out here on this show and there's got to be some paleontologists that are absolutely [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10551.74s)]
*  fascinated by this, that are willing to figure out a way to make it work. They just can't take the [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10558.94s)]
*  bones out of Alaska and they gotta be like no bullshit researchers, scientists, people that [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10564.94s)]
*  know what they're talking about. Cause I don't, they're going to want it for museums. Huh? [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10572.06s)]
*  They can't have it. Right. But that's probably what's going to like, if they do find some [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10576.22s)]
*  extraordinary stuff, the way they get value out of that is by putting it on display, [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10579.9s)]
*  doing studies on it, and then putting it on display so people can come pay money to see it. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10584.539999999999s)]
*  Right. If I go to AMNH, let's say every day for every once a week for 52 weeks, [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10588.3s)]
*  it's the same displays every week. So all the stuff they collect doesn't go on display. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10597.18s)]
*  Goes down in the storage or it goes out in the East River. The deal with my company, the nozzlemen, [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10604.06s)]
*  they called them, there were 200 guys working giants and the giant guys, the nozzle guys, [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10611.26s)]
*  part of the perks of working for that company was if you find a tusk, you can have it. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10616.619999999999s)]
*  They could take the tusks home with them. Really? Yeah. And the skulls and whatever else they found. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10622.38s)]
*  No one cared back then. Nobody cared. The company didn't care. Take them. And then these guys from [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10626.939999999999s)]
*  New York, the swift talking city dudes, they come in and go, oh, we want them. So they made it so [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10631.26s)]
*  the men couldn't take them. And they took them all. Scientific value, nothing. They took them all. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10637.58s)]
*  Well, let's just imagine you're the grandson of one of the old style nozzlemen who's now dead, [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10643.5s)]
*  but he passed that tusk along to his kid and now it's yours. That tusk could be worth $200,000. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10651.02s)]
*  That could come in handy to that family. Maybe they could have used that money along the way [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10657.98s)]
*  instead of not having it. Instead of the AMH just having it in their basement. And the letter [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10664.06s)]
*  is on there, talks about hundreds, hundreds of tusks that were shipped there. I've seen them. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10671.5s)]
*  It's not like I'm making this shit up. I was down there. I took pictures of them. You were down [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10678.699999999999s)]
*  there in the basement. In the basement. It's incredible. These big crates haven't been opened [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10683.18s)]
*  ever. And they're just filled with tusks. Well, the tusks are on these big shelves that like [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10689.58s)]
*  you see at Costco, they go way up high. Yeah. Just shelves of tusks and bison heads and stuff. And [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10694.7s)]
*  then the crates are the bones, leg bones, teeth. How the fuck can they just leave that there? [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10702.78s)]
*  It's in storage. But that seems so insane. That you have this extraordinary place that really [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10709.42s)]
*  doesn't get attention until you get on social media. And then the world knows about it, but [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10715.02s)]
*  they've known about it for a hundred years. Like that seems like something you would want people [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10719.740000000002s)]
*  to know about. Nobody gave a shit. My company didn't care until, you know, they didn't envision [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10723.660000000002s)]
*  a guy like me come along and own in this company. They had no, no. When I bought the company, I [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10728.62s)]
*  started going through the files going, let's see what I bought. You know, like the, let's see. Oh, [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10735.66s)]
*  look at that. I got a lease with the government. Oh, here's another one. I got another lease with [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10740.46s)]
*  the government. Yeah. I got a piece over here, guy offered to buy. Now I don't want to sell it. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10744.06s)]
*  So I go through all these things and I find the deal with the bones. And I went to the museum. I [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10749.74s)]
*  said, I bought Alaska gold company. I want to go get the bones. He goes, I was wondering when you're [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10755.82s)]
*  going to show up off to New York. We go got bullshitted. Oh yeah. We're going to return them [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10761.1s)]
*  when we, after we take care of the, as best as the Bateman problem ups down there. Anyway, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10767.42s)]
*  I told you all this and they have yet to get ahold of us. It's gone to our state legislature to see [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10772.78s)]
*  if they can help. It's coming back to Alaska. Those are my bones. And if they're afraid that it's [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10779.82s)]
*  going to go, well, Reeves, you know, they're worth a lot of money. You know, he, he could sell them. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10785.5s)]
*  Look, just send them back. And if I want to sell them, I'll sell them. They're my bones. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10790.78s)]
*  Also, you haven't sold what you have. It doesn't even make any sense. It's a, it's a fucking hobby. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10796.86s)]
*  You know, we're all queer for something. You know, some people collect stamps. Some people [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10802.3s)]
*  collect coins, collect coins. My mom used to collect napkins there, you know, quilts and stuff [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10807.1s)]
*  like that. I collect bones in historic sites. I like his, I got a degree in history. He probably [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10812.62s)]
*  didn't know that historic preservation. I like to fix up old shit. Talking to a guy about the Nana, [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10821.740000000002s)]
*  which where the golden spike was driven by Harding. That just went up for auction on Christie's. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10832.140000000001s)]
*  What is that? Explain that. A golden spike railroad spike that Warren Harding came up and drove [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10838.38s)]
*  in the, in the railroad back in the twenties. When they completed the Alaska railroad from [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10844.14s)]
*  Anchorage up to Nenana, which is how they keep someone from stealing that. Well, they didn't [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10851.42s)]
*  leave it in there long. They drove it in, they took the photo op, they did all that, then pulled it, [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd43tFzuG4&t=10855.179999999998s)]
