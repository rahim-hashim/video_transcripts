# Joe Rogan Experience #1945 - Eric Weinstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5.8s)]
*  We're up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9.6s)]
*  Good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10.6s)]
*  Hello, Joe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13.6s)]
*  So, we should tell everybody, this podcast came about from, what time in the morning [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14.6s)]
*  was it when I called you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=20.64s)]
*  It might have been one of them late night ones, wasn't it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=21.64s)]
*  Well, they all run together. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=25.6s)]
*  But it was a late night freak out UFO conversation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=27.12s)]
*  I was like, dude, we got to do a podcast about this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Because out of all of my friends that actually can understand physics and explain it, you [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=34.96s)]
*  comprehended it at a very high level. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=41.36s)]
*  So for things like this to be puzzling to you to the point where you actually want to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=43.08s)]
*  talk about it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=46.64s)]
*  Well, I don't want to talk about it because I got this one so wrong for years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=48.0s)]
*  I mean, there is no trace of me talking about UFOs, I think, before three years ago, because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  I can't stand the topic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=60.08s)]
*  Unlike the rest of you, this thing hits very differently. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=61.92s)]
*  Well, I should say then I've gone back and forth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=64.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=67.44s)]
*  I've watched your... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=68.44s)]
*  I abandoned it for a long time until I watched the Bob Lazar documentary. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=69.44s)]
*  When Jeremy Corbell made that Bob Lazar documentary, I was like, God damn it, they got me back [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=72.8s)]
*  in again. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=77.12s)]
*  They drew me back in again. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=78.12s)]
*  I don't think, I don't know if there's ever footage of me saying the words Bob Lazar. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=79.36s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=84.12s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=86.0s)]
*  But... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=87.0s)]
*  I would love to facilitate that dinner. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=88.0s)]
*  Oh, let's do... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=90.64s)]
*  You and Bob Lazar. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=92.04s)]
*  I don't know why... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=93.04s)]
*  There's always this question about is Bob Lazar a physicist? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=94.04s)]
*  Was he trained at these places? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=96.84s)]
*  And I have to imagine that that's an easily resolvable question because you can tell whether [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  somebody is a physicist pretty quickly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=105.48s)]
*  That's why I can't. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=108.92s)]
*  It's like, you know what it's like? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  It's like fake black belts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=111.92s)]
*  There's a lot of fake black belts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=113.72s)]
*  And if you're a real martial artist, you watch it and you go, what the fuck is this guy doing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=115.08s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=118.72s)]
*  But some people who don't have any understanding of martial arts go, oh my God, this guy has [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  a death touch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=124.4s)]
*  He just touch you behind the ear and you fall asleep. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=125.4s)]
*  And people believe it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=127.04s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I would just skip everything and go right to the five point exploding hard [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=128.68s)]
*  technique. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=132.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=133.48s)]
*  So that is how I am when, you know, physicists. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=134.48s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know what you're saying. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=136.84s)]
*  I can't verify or deny. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=138.6s)]
*  Bob Lazar is a very impressive person to talk to. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=143.2s)]
*  And what's really impressive to me is that he's had the same exact story since the 1980s [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=146.12s)]
*  and the new footage of these crafts that show them rotating 180 degrees before they take [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=152.76s)]
*  off is exactly how he described. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=159.84s)]
*  So how do you want to ease into this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  We want to just go- [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=165.32s)]
*  But what got you curious about it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=166.32s)]
*  If you had just decided that it was all horseshit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=168.24s)]
*  What changed your perspective? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  Okay, this is a really weird and interesting question. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  I had a different puzzle that I've been working on for years, which has to do with physics [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  and is important to me in my work and what I care about, which is there is this crazy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=181.54s)]
*  history between around 1953 and 1973 with an explosion of activity that sometimes goes [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=186.16s)]
*  under the name of the Golden Age of general relativity, where general relativity was sort [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=197.12s)]
*  of put in final form in the teens by Einstein and also Marcel Grossman, who never gets the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=202.44s)]
*  credit for the original papers, I think, on general relativity. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  Isn't that always the case? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=212.68s)]
*  Yeah, but- [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=213.68s)]
*  There's always like some guy behind the scenes that actually wrote for Shakespeare. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=214.68s)]
*  Einstein is the genius, but he had a mathematical friend whose father saved Einstein, I think [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=219.8s)]
*  and got him the patent job. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=225.56s)]
*  And there's like a meeting called the Marcel Grossman meeting. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=228.08s)]
*  So he's a shadowy figure on the edge of the Einstein legend. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=230.76s)]
*  I don't think he deserves the credit Einstein did, but if you look at the first paper in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=233.76s)]
*  general relativity, before Einstein says anything concrete, the first paper he says something [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=237.16s)]
*  vague, that's 1913, and that's with Grossman. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=242.8s)]
*  The next paper he says something wrong, he publishes the wrong equation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=246.6s)]
*  Then he corrects the equation and it's incomplete because it doesn't have the cosmological constant. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=249.6s)]
*  And I think it's four papers before he has the equation that now dominates our understanding [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=254.64s)]
*  of the cosmos and the large. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=261.08s)]
*  And the- so then it goes silent and effectively the smart kids are all following Bohr because [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=263.68s)]
*  Bohr and the quantum have so many open problems whereas general relativity seems like pretty [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=274.88s)]
*  much a closed book. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=281.4s)]
*  And that's until 1953. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=283.2s)]
*  And something very bizarre happens in 1953 which we can get to, but then there's 20 years [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=286.5s)]
*  of explosion in general relativity, which you know you've had Roger Penrose on your [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=291.08s)]
*  program before so he comes from that era and Stephen Hawking was interior to that era. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=297.2s)]
*  Richard Feynman of all people was very active and gave lectures at Caltech. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  So my entry point was that when I was a young guy at the University of Pennsylvania, when [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=309.96s)]
*  I'd come home to LA for break, I'd go out to Caltech and I would park in Feynman or [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=316.4s)]
*  Gell-Mann's parking spaces, which I just thought was the coolest thing in the world that these [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  people, these gods had little, you know, stones with their names stenciled on it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=325.24s)]
*  So I would go park in Feynman's space and I would go to the Caltech bookstore and I found [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=331.0s)]
*  that there was something that was sold there that at the time I don't think was sold anywhere [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  else, which was like the Feynman Lectures on Gravitation 1962 to 63. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=339.76s)]
*  And they were effed up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=344.84s)]
*  It was like Feynman says, I don't know how Einstein did his thing, but imagine that you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=346.4s)]
*  didn't have the insight that this was all geometric based on a guy named Bernard Riemann's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=351.32s)]
*  notion of what differential geometry is, sort of the smooth surface geometry of curvature. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=357.2s)]
*  And Feynman says, let's just imagine this was an ordinary field theory. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=362.76s)]
*  Am I Richard Feynman smart enough to figure out the geometry just proceeding as if I was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=366.36s)]
*  a particle theorist? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=371.76s)]
*  And like this is a very strange and interesting, wonderful thing to do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=373.68s)]
*  And these notes are fantastic. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=377.16s)]
*  My question is what happened between 1953 and 1973? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=379.56s)]
*  Because the reason that I'm in part really animated right now is that this month, February [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=384.68s)]
*  of 2023 is the exact 50th year anniversary of the stagnation in particle theory as measured [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  by the movement from the standard model. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  So the standard model in general relativity are the two basic theories, the theory of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=402.28s)]
*  the very small, the theory of the very large, they're incompatible in a certain level, but [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=407.12s)]
*  they're very similar looking at a different level. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=411.4s)]
*  So this has been driving people crazy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  When I say in 1973, Crocodile Rock was the number one song or the entire yellow ribbon [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=415.88s)]
*  around the old oak tree. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  Imagine that song being at the top of the pops for 50 years with no respite. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=425.12s)]
*  That's how impressive this is, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a great comparison. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=433.2s)]
*  So just imagine the platform shoes and feet going up above the... [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=436.2s)]
*  So it doesn't make any sense. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=438.68s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=439.68s)]
*  How did the world's smartest community stagnate this badly? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=441.68s)]
*  This has happened once before in recent times between 1928 when Dirac came up with something [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=445.64s)]
*  called quantum electrodynamics, which is electrons and photons interacting, light and a little [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=451.08s)]
*  bit of matter. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=456.76s)]
*  And for almost 20 years until 1947, we couldn't compute with this first quantum field theory, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=458.88s)]
*  quantum electrodynamics, otherwise known as QED. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  And suddenly in 1947, we held a conference at Shelter Island in the tip of Long Island. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=469.7s)]
*  And they didn't invite the old people as much as they invited the young people coming after [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=477.34s)]
*  the success of the Manhattan Project. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=481.02s)]
*  Now the Manhattan Project gets remembered by us as a physics project, but it was really [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=482.9s)]
*  engineering because the theorists were unable to fight their way out of a paper bag. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=486.38s)]
*  So we gave them an engineering project and they completely crushed it, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=492.02s)]
*  They gave us these atomic weapons. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=495.82s)]
*  So we had a pretty good idea of who was smart. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=498.1s)]
*  And people like Feynman were smart. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  So we held this weird cheap conference at Shelter Island at the Rams Head Inn. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=502.18s)]
*  And Feynman figured out that along with a guy named Julian Schwinger and another guy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  named Tomonaga in Japan, that there was a stupid error, like a really boneheaded, you [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  know, I can't find my keys for 20 years. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=517.94s)]
*  And then you realize, oh, they're in my pocket. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=519.9s)]
*  So this thing had to do with the fact that there are two concepts of mass for the electron. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=523.02s)]
*  And if you imagine that this was, that this table between us was ice, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=529.46s)]
*  And I pushed this cup, then we would know about how much the mass of this cup was based [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=535.18s)]
*  on how it responded to force. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=541.38s)]
*  But what if I start putting friction, now it's wood, it appears to be slightly more [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=544.26s)]
*  massive because it takes more force to drag a cup across wood than it does across ice [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=548.5s)]
*  because of the coefficient of friction. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=553.12s)]
*  That number is the effective mass or the dressed mass. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=555.7s)]
*  And we thought that that was the real mass. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=559.7s)]
*  And we had those two numbers set equal. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=561.86s)]
*  And when we realized that they weren't the same number, suddenly the theory yielded. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=563.46s)]
*  So it was a 20 year stagnation that ended because there was a boneheaded mistake. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=568.26s)]
*  So we have some experience with this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=573.2s)]
*  Is this stagnation more confusing to you because everything else has kind of moved [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=576.26s)]
*  along technologically, innovation? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=583.98s)]
*  No things mostly haven't moved. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=587.46s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=589.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=590.5s)]
*  We all have this sense of, oh my God, the dizzying pace of progress. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=591.5s)]
*  And then I always said this problem this way. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=594.98s)]
*  I say, if you subtract the screens in our lives, so there are phones, the flat screen [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=597.9s)]
*  TVs, all that stuff. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=602.66s)]
*  And you forget about style issues because style changes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=603.94s)]
*  How do you know you're not in 1973? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  More or less. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  We don't have George Jetsons stuff everywhere. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=611.3000000000001s)]
*  Style would be a big one. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=613.98s)]
*  Yeah, style would be. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  But just in terms of technologically, the distance between 1952, where we have the first [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=616.1400000000001s)]
*  thermonuclear device in the test known as Ivy Mike, and 1902 before we even have powered [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=621.34s)]
*  flight is like 10,000 years. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=626.3000000000001s)]
*  It's enormous. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=628.74s)]
*  The difference between 1973 and 2023 is mostly due to computers. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=630.5s)]
*  Computers and communication are the two really big expanding things. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=637.86s)]
*  I'm not saying you don't have quadcopters. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=640.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=643.26s)]
*  But because we interact with that primarily, we think of things as being far more advanced [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=644.26s)]
*  on a broad scale. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=650.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, this is the issue. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  The way I used to say it is it was between electrons and atoms. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=652.94s)]
*  The world of atoms stagnated. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=656.66s)]
*  The world of electrons went crazy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=658.54s)]
*  It's actually a very good point, too, in terms of one of the major industries that has to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=662.54s)]
*  improve every year's automobiles. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=668.86s)]
*  And the problem with that is they're so good. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=671.18s)]
*  If you get to a Tesla level of performance, the idea that you're going to get faster than [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  that is fucking insane. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=679.02s)]
*  You don't want to necessarily get fast. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=680.02s)]
*  You don't want to get that fast. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=681.5799999999999s)]
*  The idea that you could just go to a store and buy a car that will go 0 to 60 in two [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=683.06s)]
*  seconds is fucking nuts. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=688.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=690.7399999999999s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=691.7399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's mostly a battery and a computer claiming to be a car. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=692.7399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=696.9s)]
*  What I was going to say is they're all reliant on computers now. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=697.9s)]
*  I really like old cars. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=701.54s)]
*  You can tinker. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=702.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=704.3399999999999s)]
*  But it's also I just like that there's a direct connection mechanically. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=705.3399999999999s)]
*  You feel a mechanical connection to the gears and the steering. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=708.9s)]
*  There's something about them that's very satisfying. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=712.7s)]
*  They don't even have to be fast. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=714.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't have to move fast. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=716.1800000000001s)]
*  Driving around normally, it's like driving a ride. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=717.58s)]
*  It's very fun. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=720.1400000000001s)]
*  Whereas with a Tesla, it's just you know that if you turn the wheel, it'll turn the actual [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=721.46s)]
*  wheels that are on the road, but you don't feel them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=729.1800000000001s)]
*  You don't feel that thing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=732.6s)]
*  You're just turning a thing and a thing happens. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=733.94s)]
*  You're not directly connected to it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=736.26s)]
*  It's all computers. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=737.98s)]
*  Well, it's like all the new cars rely on computers. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=738.98s)]
*  If you listen to John Mayer, for example, talking about what's wrong with modeling amplifiers, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=741.7s)]
*  you can get $100,000 worth of equipment in one of these little boxes, but a tube amp [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=747.26s)]
*  is hard to replace because there's something special in analog technology of a different [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=754.34s)]
*  time or you pass current through a pickup and that magnet, there's magic that happens [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=758.94s)]
*  between wood and magnets and steel, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=764.34s)]
*  All this kind of stuff. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate an automatic transmission as a thing of beauty, but I'd rather drive a [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=769.1s)]
*  stick still. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=774.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=775.22s)]
*  You don't want to drive one in traffic, but if it's just you enjoying driving, there's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=776.22s)]
*  nothing like a stick shift. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=780.58s)]
*  This is where they lose the focus with computers. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=782.78s)]
*  It's like you're taking away one of the best things about driving, which is the enjoyment [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=786.4200000000001s)]
*  of driving, and you're replacing it with tenths of a second that no one's going to notice [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  and you really shouldn't notice anyway because they're all ridiculously fast. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but this train will not slow down. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=799.96s)]
*  Well, I get it, but people need to understand just from a human perspective, you will enjoy [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  driving a manual car more. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  If you have any life left in you, if you have any fucking spark left in you when you're on [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=813.72s)]
*  a windy road, you want to go wah, wah, even if you're not driving fast, it's so much more [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=819.52s)]
*  fun. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=825.36s)]
*  The [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=826.48s)]
*  BMWs had to put sound back in because they'd subtracted so much sound through their patented [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=829.96s)]
*  insulation systems. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=835.4s)]
*  BMW's done that as well. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=836.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's not safe. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=837.4s)]
*  It's gross. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=838.4s)]
*  Well, now you're like, you're going to simulate. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=839.4s)]
*  It's gross. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=840.4s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=841.4s)]
*  They're talking about doing that for Ferraris because they're going to make an EV Ferrari. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=842.4s)]
*  So if they made an electrical Ferrari, they're talking about making fake Ferrari noises, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=845.64s)]
*  which is just an atrocious thing to come out of Italy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=850.36s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=854.6s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=855.84s)]
*  You guys are all passion and whine and sound. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=856.84s)]
*  A Ferrari is supposed to be like this high revving. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=860.36s)]
*  There's something about that as it's happening that excites you. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  It's music, it's dance, it's love. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=870.08s)]
*  It's real. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  You can't have fake Ferrari sounds. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=876.76s)]
*  No. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=879.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=880.28s)]
*  No, but Elon's cars don't make any sound. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=881.28s)]
*  I love it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=882.28s)]
*  I get terrified of it because they sneak up behind me. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=883.28s)]
*  That is an issue. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=886.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=887.52s)]
*  But so getting back to the whole UFO thing and the progress, we don't realize what percentage [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=888.52s)]
*  of life was determined by physics. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=896.52s)]
*  So for example, Wi-Fi and all the communication is the electromagnetic spectrum, including [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=897.52s)]
*  radio waves. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=902.88s)]
*  We don't realize the semiconductor, which created the logic gate. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=903.88s)]
*  All we did was scale it up and now it's chat GPT. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=910.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=913.68s)]
*  The number of things that have changed the world, whether it's the World Wide Web coming [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=915.68s)]
*  out of CERN, physics is really what has moved the dial, including molecular biology founded [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=919.56s)]
*  by physicists more or less. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=925.64s)]
*  So when you lose this community, you don't understand. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=928.0s)]
*  Like you think, okay, that's some egghead shit. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=931.28s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  Physics is basically progress. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  Physics created the modern economy and to have a 50-year stagnation, particularly, and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=938.04s)]
*  I want to draw a really important contrast, 1968 was the year we discovered the quark. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=946.04s)]
*  So in every proton, there are three valence quarks, two of them named up, one of them [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=951.64s)]
*  named down. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=955.64s)]
*  In a neutron, it's two downs and one up. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=956.64s)]
*  So that's how we, neutrons and protons are not fundamental. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  When we found the neutron, it was in 1932. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=963.48s)]
*  So my aunt, Judy, shout out to aunt Judy of Philadelphia, is older than the neutron. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=966.24s)]
*  And the neutron doomed us as a species. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=972.48s)]
*  Like that one discovery more or less indicated that if we do not leave this world, we will [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=975.28s)]
*  die here in short order. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=980.16s)]
*  Because if you throw a proton at a very heavy nucleus, it doesn't crash into the nucleus. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=982.48s)]
*  You've got all these protons in the center that are all positively charged and this one [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=990.4s)]
*  guy is coming in at high speed and all these massive protons say, like charges repel and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=993.92s)]
*  this thing just runs away like scaredy cat. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1001.52s)]
*  A neutron is almost a proton. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1004.88s)]
*  It's basically the same kind of a deal but with no charge. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1006.9s)]
*  So it doesn't understand that you're telling it, go back, danger. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1010.78s)]
*  And it just screams in and it can split these nuclei, releasing all of this energy and then [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1014.88s)]
*  you get these chain reactions with the neutrons radiating out. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1021.2s)]
*  So in 1932, we discover the neutron. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1024.68s)]
*  I think it was by 38, this woman named Lise Meitner figures out the chain reaction. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1028.56s)]
*  By 42, 10 years after the discovery of the neutron, Enrico Fermi and something called [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1034.3600000000001s)]
*  Chicago Pile 1, CP1, crazily does a controlled chain reaction under the bleachers of the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  Shout out to the University of Chicago Stadium, which could have obliterated the city of Chicago [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1048.0s)]
*  if it had gone critical, right? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1052.4s)]
*  I mean, if it had just run away, nobody knew what was going to happen. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1053.76s)]
*  So we trusted the city of Chicago to Enrico Fermi's calculation. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1057.8s)]
*  By 45, you get Trinity and the two bombs we drop on Japan. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1062.96s)]
*  And then in 1952, game over, you have Ivy Mike and the first thermonuclear weapon based [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1067.92s)]
*  on the Teller-Ulam design, which uses the fission bomb just for foreplay as the detonator [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1074.08s)]
*  that causes the waves to go out, radiate out against the shell. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1081.24s)]
*  And I think we still don't talk exactly how we do it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1085.08s)]
*  And then they bounce off and they compress this rod and core and then you get fusion [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1087.6999999999998s)]
*  rather than fission. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1091.24s)]
*  And suddenly you're harnessing the power of the sun. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1092.78s)]
*  And that's when you don't even worry about ducking cover because thermonuclear is such [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1096.1799999999998s)]
*  a leap above fission devices. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1100.44s)]
*  And that's such a leap above conventional that it takes 20 years for us to become God, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1104.32s)]
*  right? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1109.88s)]
*  And this power we can't control. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1110.88s)]
*  We need to worry about physics because you never know when somebody is going to discover [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  a neutron. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1120.28s)]
*  In other words, a high leverage object, just like the semiconductor was a high leverage [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1121.28s)]
*  The World Wide Web in the early 90s was the high leverage object. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1126.28s)]
*  Anything that comes out of physics, oh, and you know, Francis Crick, physicist discovering [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1130.76s)]
*  the three dimensional structure of DNA and then the transfer hypothesis of where you [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1134.36s)]
*  translate DNA into messenger RNA, which gets read in ribosomes. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1140.48s)]
*  All of these things changed the world and effectively gave us so much power that we [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  don't know how to control it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1152.0s)]
*  And we were so scared for 70 years because it's six months between 1952 and 53 where [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1154.16s)]
*  we discover both the atom and the cell and how they work in terms of this forbidden knowledge. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1163.0400000000002s)]
*  We were so scared that we behaved ourselves. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1169.72s)]
*  And now we're not scared. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1173.24s)]
*  We're like Slava Ukraine, just whatever. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1174.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've got Putin. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1177.96s)]
*  We're going to back him into a corner. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1180.4s)]
*  We should probably say that this is actually the day that we're talking about. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1182.92s)]
*  This is the day that Putin just backed out of the nuclear treaty publicly, which is not [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1186.5600000000002s)]
*  good with Joe Biden going to Kiev and pledging his undying love to. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1194.48s)]
*  And I'm going to say this, which is very painful. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1201.16s)]
*  I think Zelensky is a complete menace. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1204.52s)]
*  Why do you think that he's romantic? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  He's telegenic. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1212.12s)]
*  He's brave. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1213.32s)]
*  We can talk about whether he got set up in a coup or who he really is. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  He was an actor, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  But at some point, I think I heard him. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1223.24s)]
*  I had to go back to the Russian and Ukrainian speeches in order to try to... [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1226.0s)]
*  I don't speak much Russian. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1230.52s)]
*  I don't speak any Ukrainian, but they're closely related languages. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1231.72s)]
*  And he calls for preventive strikes. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1235.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, huh? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1239.28s)]
*  This is a while ago. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1241.28s)]
*  And I thought, why is this person allowed to address Congress? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1243.72s)]
*  You have somebody who... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1250.04s)]
*  And I want to be very clear about this. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1252.2s)]
*  I really find it disgusting what Vladimir Putin did invading Ukraine. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1255.96s)]
*  But if you look historically at the killing and the borders of Eastern and Central Europe, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1262.84s)]
*  they have gone back and forth like nobody's business. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1268.76s)]
*  When you ask somebody like me, an American Ashkenazi Jew, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1273.2s)]
*  where did your family come from? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1276.16s)]
*  You always get the same weird response. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1277.88s)]
*  It's like, oh, it was a part of Belarusia that went back and forth between Poland, Ukraine, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1279.48s)]
*  Moldova, Lithuania, because it's fluid. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1284.28s)]
*  Right? And so when we say we respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1289.72s)]
*  we were fighting right now in Lvov. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1295.04s)]
*  The Ukrainians were fighting in Lvov eight seconds by hypersonic missile [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1297.8s)]
*  from Article 5 territory since 1999 in Poland. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1302.24s)]
*  And I realized how crazy we got. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  I was in Providence, Rhode Island with my son. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1310.76s)]
*  And I get this alert on my phone and it says, two people are dead in Poland [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1313.48s)]
*  with a presumptive strike by a Russian missile. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1320.76s)]
*  I'm thinking, did I read two Polish people dead in an Article 5 full NATO member since 1999 [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1324.52s)]
*  with a Russian missile? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1335.8s)]
*  Because I knew we were fighting way too close to this border. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, by the way, if I say Lvov, everyone's going to correct me and say, no, no, Eric, it's Lviv. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1339.84s)]
*  It's like, no, these cities all have multiple pronunciations. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1345.6399999999999s)]
*  I always thought of Lvov was a Polish city, not a Ukrainian city. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1349.4s)]
*  And ironically, I believe Lvov is the birthplace of Stanislav Ulam, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1353.0s)]
*  who came up with the Teller Ulam thermonuclear design. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1358.2s)]
*  So we're talking about some of the world's smartest people [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1361.96s)]
*  on some of the world's bloodiest, most disgusting, most beautiful land. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1365.76s)]
*  You know, have you ever been to Ukraine? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1370.0s)]
*  No. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1372.0s)]
*  So my family basically is scattered, you know, was scattered throughout the shtetls of Ukraine. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1373.92s)]
*  And I've been over there in 89. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1379.08s)]
*  We Americans do not understand Central and Eastern Europe, period, the end. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1384.12s)]
*  And for us to be making these commitments and not understanding how Russians think [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1389.76s)]
*  and how Ukrainians think and how Poles think and how the fighting works, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't think we know what we're doing. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  I think we're creating a doomsday machine. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1402.24s)]
*  The reason that we, you know, it's not like Zelensky isn't wronged by Putin. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1405.24s)]
*  It's not like he's not charismatic. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1410.44s)]
*  He has one of the greatest Bruce Willis lines of all time. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1414.6s)]
*  When we asked to evacuate him, he says, I need ammunition. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1417.28s)]
*  Not a ride. You know, that thing makes us. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1421.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I want that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  There's like house to house fighting the way all the World War Two enthusiasts think. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  They tend not to think about Nagasaki and Hiroshima. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1430.76s)]
*  They like the tactical stuff with all the you know, which bridge got taken out over which river and how do we do this? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1433.72s)]
*  So it's very romantic to people who are like World War Two addicts. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1439.92s)]
*  We do not realize how deep the trouble we're courting is. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1444.16s)]
*  And I don't think we realize how dangerous it is. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1448.5600000000002s)]
*  If we are going to every time there's a border dispute, go to a thermonuclear standoff. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1451.5600000000002s)]
*  It's just Russian roulette with smaller and smaller numbers of empty chambers. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1460.08s)]
*  And I don't know what this is. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1466.12s)]
*  I don't know whether we have 30 years to play this game or three or three months. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1467.6s)]
*  But I learned that day last year in 2022. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1472.2s)]
*  Nobody around me in Providence, Rhode Island, was reacting. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1478.24s)]
*  Everybody's just going about. It was like a normal day. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1481.72s)]
*  It's like I'm increasingly, Joe, believing that I am saying and that the world is crazy. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1485.04s)]
*  And normally I take that as a cue that maybe I need to get some sleep. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1492.24s)]
*  No, I think we're actually just going crazy. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1496.56s)]
*  I think that those of us who actually get how risky this is need to speak up because it's not fun. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1498.72s)]
*  The entire apparatus will tell you that you're soft on Putin and you're an appeasing Chamberlain wannabe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1504.04s)]
*  And it's like bullshit. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1511.36s)]
*  Right now, you don't realize in 2004, we let Latvia and Lithuania into NATO membership. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1512.96s)]
*  I remember thinking at the time, what the hell are we doing? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1520.4s)]
*  It's not like I don't understand that we want to protect them. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not like I don't understand that you want to say that they're independent nations. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1526.68s)]
*  But these were former Soviet republics. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1529.76s)]
*  And there's two ways of thinking about it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1532.92s)]
*  You can put on one set of glasses and say, well, these are nations that get to decide what they want and who's to tell them what to do. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1534.44s)]
*  And then there's another thing called spheres of influence, where it's like that's the Russian sphere of influence. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1540.48s)]
*  If you are not playing with both of these sets of lenses, you're not playing the game. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1545.16s)]
*  And the number of people who just have one set of these glasses on, right, they're only seeing the infrared or they're only seeing the ultraviolet. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1549.68s)]
*  It's like, no, you need to oscillate back and forth and understand what you're doing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1557.2s)]
*  So I think I think Zelensky and I'm scared to say this because I know I'm going to get just nothing but hate. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1560.68s)]
*  We created a situation by pretending that we didn't understand the spheres of influence glasses. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1567.32s)]
*  We very well understand the sovereignty glasses. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  And we are now creating a doomsday machine that we do not understand. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1576.48s)]
*  And the world is going to go multipolar. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  And we don't have the skill to play this game. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1582.2s)]
*  Do you think part of the problem is that we're the amount of people that have actually gone to war in this country? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1585.2s)]
*  First of all, there's there's people that are in the army or in all the armed forces. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1594.84s)]
*  They're they're volunteers, everyone volunteers. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  There's no draft. There's no national requirement to join the military like there is in Israel and like there is in South Korea and many other countries. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1602.44s)]
*  We the people that have experience with the war are the ones that are telling you this is dangerous. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1612.72s)]
*  People like yourself are telling us this is dangerous. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1618.8s)]
*  But to the rest of the world, to the rest of this country, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1620.9199999999998s)]
*  there's a real problem with day to day existence because day to day existence is tricky and it gives you parameters which you exist in. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1623.72s)]
*  But they're not real. They're not real. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  They're not real. They're only real right now. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1632.44s)]
*  And if you invite war, you now are like these videos that you can watch. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1635.68s)]
*  I don't know if you're on Telegram. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1640.44s)]
*  There are some fucking videos from this war on like in the woods, ground fighting. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1643.28s)]
*  I've seen them. Heavy, heavy shit. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1649.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't think people that show up every day at the same Starbucks and then get on the highway and go to their office and repeat every fucking day. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1653.0s)]
*  I don't think they think of that as a real option in the world. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1662.24s)]
*  But it is. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1665.8400000000001s)]
*  Think of daily life as Ketamine. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1666.56s)]
*  OK. So you've got people walking around completely dissociated because everything in their daily environment tells them to pick up the dry cleaning. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1669.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1677.64s)]
*  And you know, oh, everything's fine. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1678.52s)]
*  Well, what's on Netflix? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1681.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1683.44s)]
*  At least in the Cuban Missile Crisis, my father was driving across country. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1685.44s)]
*  I said, you knew it was the he's everybody knew it was a Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1689.32s)]
*  Every single town that he drove through, he would stop and the TV would be on. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1693.56s)]
*  People were talking about it. Right. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  We are in some world where and I think that we have to just talk about the fact that the United States is attacking ordinary intelligent human beings by [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1699.44s)]
*  depriving them of any basic knowledge of what is actually going on. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1709.96s)]
*  We don't know what happened with the origin of covid. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1717.08s)]
*  We have no idea about Epstein. We don't know what's going on with the vaccines. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  We don't understand the source of the inflation. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1723.0s)]
*  We blinded ourselves from looking at the M1 monetary aggregate when the Fed pumped us full of cheap cash. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1725.16s)]
*  We have no clue how to resolve, you know, something as dumb as the Epstein. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1732.3600000000001s)]
*  To whom did Ghislaine traffic? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1739.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1741.44s)]
*  Well, can't find it. Sorry. Bye. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1742.6s)]
*  So this is what's causing in part our friends to go crazy. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1744.36s)]
*  You know, several years ago, Sam Harris had good input. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1750.12s)]
*  Jordan Harrison, Jordan Peterson had good input. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1754.28s)]
*  Brett Weinstein had good input. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1757.2s)]
*  Most of them, I don't think have figured out that they're starved for information and that I'm going to say something very heterogic. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1760.12s)]
*  Heterodox to the heterodoxy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1768.9199999999998s)]
*  The heterodoxy was never meant to take over for the orthodoxy. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1771.0s)]
*  The orthodoxy was something that needed correction. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1774.9199999999998s)]
*  The purpose of the heterodoxy is to say you're 12 degrees off, you're three degrees off. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1777.24s)]
*  What do you do when you're like 168 degrees off? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1783.12s)]
*  And all, you know, like the fine tuning that heterodoxy can do is not sufficient to correct the ship. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1786.9599999999998s)]
*  And what we're being what's happening to us. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  I said this to Sam at a dinner with Dave Rubin right before Trump took over. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1794.56s)]
*  I said, Sam, if you don't take a different approach to Trump, he's going to blow out your circuits. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1798.84s)]
*  He said, what do you mean? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1804.28s)]
*  I said, well, for every ambiguous thing that you can't resolve with Trump, raise two to that power. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1805.6s)]
*  So if he puts three ambiguities in a series, you have two to the third possibilities of what could be true. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1813.36s)]
*  That's eight. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1821.96s)]
*  He can create a decision tree that explodes faster than you, Sam Harris, can think. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1823.48s)]
*  Right. There's no way you can get to two to the fourth possibilities on a decision tree. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1829.68s)]
*  Sam, I don't think he understood the perspective. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1835.84s)]
*  And so what happened was we were all swimming in this world where nobody could tell which end was up. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1838.48s)]
*  Nobody can resolve anything. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1842.68s)]
*  And I think a lot of this has to do. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1844.92s)]
*  Not sure I understand what you were just saying there. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1846.44s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1848.92s)]
*  This decision tree thing that Sam, he was going to explain that. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  So let's imagine, for example, that I'm staying at a local hotel. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1854.3600000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1857.5600000000002s)]
*  And you don't know whether I'm staying at the Hyatt or the Four Seasons. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1858.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1861.1200000000001s)]
*  And you also can't figure out whether I'm leaving at one o'clock or two o'clock. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1861.5200000000002s)]
*  And you don't know whether I'm going to be arriving by a white Prius or a black Escalade. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1868.0s)]
*  You now have too many possibilities as to, well, what's the drive time for those two hotels is different. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1878.36s)]
*  I don't know which car I'm looking for. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1884.8799999999999s)]
*  There are eight possibilities now of what could actually be happening, because those are all independent. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1886.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1890.96s)]
*  When Trump created ambiguities or now the Biden group is creating ambiguities by not telling us what's actually going on, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1892.48s)]
*  you don't know how serious this East Palestine, Ohio spill is. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1899.6s)]
*  Is this something that's going to burn off pretty easily or is this getting into the corn crop that's going to be found in all process? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1904.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to very good question. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. OK. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1912.64s)]
*  So just every day you're being assaulted by completely unnecessary ambiguities. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1913.68s)]
*  And this is but why. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1920.4s)]
*  But why then the Trump thing? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1922.96s)]
*  Why his why would his derangement towards Trump? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1925.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, because a lot of circuits Sam made one terrible call with Trump. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1929.92s)]
*  He said that he was the evil Chauncey Gardner, like a simpleton like Mr. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1933.44s)]
*  Magoo just happens to wander into the Oval Office as the first first president with zero government experience, including the armed services. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1938.56s)]
*  Bullshit. Trump may be a savant, but he was brilliant. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1947.96s)]
*  Absolutely brilliant. If you do not give that devil its due, you're toast. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1953.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's silly to say that he's dumb because he's different. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  He says some dumb stuff sometimes, but oftentimes he's talking off the top of his head. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1962.08s)]
*  Oh, I don't even like maybe use some bleach, clean it out. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1966.36s)]
*  Remember that? Exactly. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1969.52s)]
*  But meanwhile, one of the things that he said about using light. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1971.6s)]
*  Right. Actually, they came up with a process of doing that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1976.08s)]
*  That was an actual procedure that they would use where they use ultraviolet light inside a person's lungs and kill the covid virus. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1979.8799999999999s)]
*  This was like a concept that they were actually putting forth as being possible. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  So what he said, even though it sounded ridiculous, get light into the body. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1990.88s)]
*  He actually was right. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1996.6000000000001s)]
*  But that's the thing. So then a bunch of people said, OK, right. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=1998.2s)]
*  I'm going to put a minus sign in front of Trump. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2000.68s)]
*  Everything that he says is just wrong. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2002.48s)]
*  We can't do that. Well, they did this to Alex Jones. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2004.44s)]
*  You know, it's James O'Keefe and they'll do it to you and me. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2006.88s)]
*  They definitely don't to me. They have definitely done to you, too. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2009.44s)]
*  It's a thing that people do just because someone look, I say dumb things all the time, constantly. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2012.72s)]
*  My kids never. I never do. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2018.6000000000001s)]
*  I am always saying dumb things because I talk sometimes before I totally think. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2020.44s)]
*  But then I go, oh, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2024.64s)]
*  And then I'll correct it. Like, I'm trying not to be married to my thoughts. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2027.0s)]
*  There's a real problem. You're great at this, by the way. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2030.56s)]
*  It was a real problem because I recognize my fucking shortcomings. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2032.72s)]
*  Me, too. I know that I am I'm scattered. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2036.24s)]
*  OK, because I do a lot of different things and I'm thinking about things that are totally unnecessary, like professional pool matches. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2039.96s)]
*  I think about that all the time. I got to get position on that six ball. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2046.0s)]
*  It's crazy. And I think about that when I'm driving my car. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2048.72s)]
*  So I'm a scatterbrain in a lot of ways. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2051.3199999999997s)]
*  So sometimes when I'm talking, I'm I'm there, but I'm not like fully formed in these thoughts. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2053.56s)]
*  I'm trying to talk them out in real time. Right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2060.72s)]
*  And you get clumsy with that. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2063.12s)]
*  And when you concentrate on something, you get really good at it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2065.08s)]
*  And if you concentrate on something and try and improve on something, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2069.68s)]
*  whether it's playing chess or whether it is business, you get really good at it. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2072.16s)]
*  And in the meanwhile, you might not be good at interpersonal relationships. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  You might not be good at the way you communicate with people. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2080.3199999999997s)]
*  You might not be good at it, but you have some weird thing that you're doing that seems to be successful. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2082.8799999999997s)]
*  And you're you're putting all your energy into that. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2089.0s)]
*  That's what he's doing. That's what he's always done. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2091.56s)]
*  What he's always done is like these business deals and making money and putting a fucking giant hotel with his name on it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  Whoa. Like, that's what he thinks about. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2100.12s)]
*  And he's really good at that shit. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2102.8399999999997s)]
*  I would say he's tactical. Yeah. Extreme. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2104.64s)]
*  You can't say he's not smart. It's just like he's he's just not Sam Harris. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2106.8s)]
*  He's not capable of those kind of eloquent speeches and conversations off off the cuff like that, which is a totally different skill. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2111.36s)]
*  But if you looked at his tweets, for example, back in the day, there was so much formula in those tweets. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2118.84s)]
*  I started coming up with a template. He had five different tweets. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2124.88s)]
*  And Sam just would not let go of the idea that he's a dumb dumb. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2128.8s)]
*  And that was super expensive in the long run. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2132.76s)]
*  But I think it's because Sam knows that if you get in a debate with that guy, he could trounce him. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2136.56s)]
*  Part of it is that you think you think, yes, Sam could trounce him if they got in debate about religion, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2142.04s)]
*  if they got in a debate about about certain things that Sam is like neuroscience, certain things that Sam is very educated in. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2149.4s)]
*  He's he's so good at debates. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2157.0s)]
*  It's like being a black belt that's used to tapping people all the time. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2159.52s)]
*  And then you see this guy, it's he's winning debates against people because he's calling them like, what does he call? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2162.6s)]
*  Lion Ted. And he calls he gives people nicknames. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  And and I think if I was Sam and I was as good as debate at debate as Sam is, I would go fuck this guy up. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  Sam doesn't know what's coming to him, if that's true, because there was a guy named Max Bleacher. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2179.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, Sam, dragging into this. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2183.7599999999998s)]
*  Who was a who was a Los Angeles attorney who had a crazy idea. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2185.2799999999997s)]
*  He said, I'm going to try really complex antitrust cases in front of juries. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2188.96s)]
*  Look, the jury's not going to be able to follow that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2194.2000000000003s)]
*  He's like, exactly. I'm going to speak simply. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2196.2000000000003s)]
*  Look, one way to win one of these arguments is just say, you know, the problem is the nuclear family. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2199.88s)]
*  All right. And every single Democrat will say, you mean nuclear. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2206.44s)]
*  And then you've lost because when you correct somebody who's saying nuclear or like, OK, it's nuclear egghead. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2211.16s)]
*  You lose. Nuclear is a way to say it, too. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2218.64s)]
*  It is now. So that's how that's how George W. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2221.92s)]
*  Bush always said it. And everybody's like, hey, what the Dennis Miller had a bit about it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2225.12s)]
*  But it wins. Right. So this is why if you sit down with one of these, like if you and I are at the beach, right. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2229.08s)]
*  And we've got the world's greatest beach volleyball team on one side and the world's greatest CPEC [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2235.12s)]
*  tuck row team on the other side. It's a ball. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2239.64s)]
*  It's a net and three, three, three dudes. OK. OK. Who wins? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2242.6s)]
*  The people that are better. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2247.32s)]
*  Nope. Who? Depends who the ref is. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2248.7200000000003s)]
*  If the ref thinks it's volleyball, then the volleyball team will win. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2250.88s)]
*  And if the ref thinks it's CPEC tuck row, the CPEC tuck row team, it's the same. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2253.52s)]
*  I don't know what CPEC tuck row is. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2258.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's like the most beautiful. You know what that is? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2261.0800000000004s)]
*  What is it? It's similar to the thing with that ball that we have out there that. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2263.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, you have like one of these for Tan balls. Oh, OK. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  That's like martial arts ballet in the air with the feet. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2271.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like it's it's the best game ever. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2275.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't know why we're not doing it. Right. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2277.64s)]
*  Well, we can't do it. Those guys are fucking. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2279.2s)]
*  I destroyed my left ankle on this game. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2281.64s)]
*  Oh, you can't be doing that. You can't. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2283.96s)]
*  No, no. I was a young man. I was courting my wife. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2285.9199999999996s)]
*  I was going to impress her in Indonesia. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2287.7999999999997s)]
*  Show like let an American take over. OK, here we go. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2289.2s)]
*  These guys are these guys are phenomenal. OK. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  My dad is insane. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2294.24s)]
*  I mean, that's like a hundred Yair Rodriguez is out there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2295.64s)]
*  Yair Rodriguez is a UFC fighter of fights like. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2299.04s)]
*  Why? I almost did it with boxing versus UFC. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2301.56s)]
*  Right. Is the issue punching people in the face or is the issue [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2304.12s)]
*  doing everything except for small joints and eye sockets? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2306.96s)]
*  That kind of thing, though, requires like a kind of dexterity [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2310.3599999999997s)]
*  that's very difficult to acquire. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2314.08s)]
*  Like that kind of dexterity with your legs. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2316.08s)]
*  That's like a Taekwondo dexterity. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2318.3199999999997s)]
*  Percent. The question is, what are the rules? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2320.0s)]
*  So in other words, if if Sam Harris goes up against Donald Trump, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2322.04s)]
*  I can tell you who's going to win depending upon how we score. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2326.2s)]
*  OK. What if what if they have a conversation instead of like [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2329.72s)]
*  having this? This here's what I don't like about debates. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2333.72s)]
*  Yeah. This what's artificial is that one person gets to talk [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2336.48s)]
*  for X amount of time. Yeah. It seems silly to me. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2340.12s)]
*  I don't mind someone being able to talk, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2343.24s)]
*  but it has to be a conversation. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2347.48s)]
*  Someone cannot dominate the conversation like you and I. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2349.4399999999996s)]
*  If you and I had a disagreement and I just wouldn't let you talk. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2351.64s)]
*  It's very frustrating. It sucks. It's not good for anybody. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2354.56s)]
*  More likely to do it the other way. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2357.08s)]
*  It could happen that way. It could happen that way. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2358.52s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2360.9199999999996s)]
*  It's like it's not fun and it's not it's not fair. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2362.0s)]
*  And if you're going to have it's like a fight, you can't. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2364.88s)]
*  I can poke you in the eye, but you can't poke me in the eye. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2368.12s)]
*  No, that's not fair. Right. It has to be fair. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2370.08s)]
*  So if you're going to have a and someone say, well, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2372.48s)]
*  he's not capable of having a good faith conversation. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2376.2s)]
*  But that's the only way to do it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2378.36s)]
*  The only way to do it is to have an open ended time frame [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2379.72s)]
*  where you could just until this fucking thing is resolved, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2383.12s)]
*  right, until we all give up. You guys can talk. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2386.04s)]
*  Was Dick Fosbury fair? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2388.72s)]
*  It was Dick Fosbury, the high jump guy from 68 in Mexico City. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2390.84s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2394.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, he figured out you had to go backwards over the bar [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2396.0s)]
*  rather than scissoring. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2399.04s)]
*  Oh, he's the first guy to figure that out. Yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2400.32s)]
*  Oh, no kidding. All right. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2402.32s)]
*  That's a pretty fucking bold move. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2404.0800000000004s)]
*  Bold move or like you enter a catamaran in the America's Cup. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2406.2400000000002s)]
*  Because they have the same big pad. Yeah. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2410.36s)]
*  So they have the same big pad before and they were just landing on it like that. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2412.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's crazy. Right. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2415.44s)]
*  Whoa, that's insane. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2418.04s)]
*  That's how they used to do it. Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2420.32s)]
*  Wow. Right. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2422.12s)]
*  So zero day exploit. Did you know this? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you know? I feel like I knew this. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2426.28s)]
*  And I'm just remembering. I know about the Fosbury jump [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2428.16s)]
*  because I've heard of that, but I didn't I didn't know how they did it before. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2429.48s)]
*  I never looked. Oh, shit. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2431.68s)]
*  At the same Olympics, you have Bob Beeman jumping like, what is it? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2433.2s)]
*  Two feet farther than any humans. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2436.56s)]
*  Like probably the greatest single athletic performance of the 20th century [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2438.36s)]
*  happens there. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2441.4s)]
*  But zero day exploits are really interesting. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2442.52s)]
*  Another one was the Bombay International Table Tennis Championship [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2445.64s)]
*  and the weakest player on the Japanese team was a guy. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2450.44s)]
*  I'm going to get the name wrong here. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2453.2s)]
*  Jamie, keep me honest. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2454.6s)]
*  Hiroji Satouji. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2456.12s)]
*  He shows up in Bombay and he's like the worst player. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  And he's got the secret paddle case and he unzips it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2462.64s)]
*  And he's got rubber glued to both sides of the sandpaper bat [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2468.16s)]
*  that everybody else is using. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2471.92s)]
*  And he dominates everybody. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2474.16s)]
*  And you think because the rubber grips and spins. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2476.8399999999997s)]
*  But I think it's actually that everyone was cued to the sound [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2479.08s)]
*  and this dead in the sound. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2483.0s)]
*  And suddenly nobody could play against him. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2485.0s)]
*  And so, you know, so he's like Iron Man. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2487.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. They're thinking they have another thing that they're thinking about now. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, why does it sound they don't even know that? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2492.24s)]
*  Oh, right. Interesting. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2494.2s)]
*  OK. Hiroji Satouji's controversial sponge bat that caused a revolution [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2498.04s)]
*  in table tennis. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2502.88s)]
*  But also, wouldn't it slow the ball down because of the softness of it? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2503.96s)]
*  I would imagine it would give you more control. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2509.56s)]
*  It seems like it would do both of those things. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2511.96s)]
*  Maybe it would slow the ball down a little bit because it's got a little bit of smush to it. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2514.32s)]
*  And I think that would almost be like a change up in like a pitching situation [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  where someone's throwing a ball, you're expecting it to be 90 miles an hour instead of 60. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2523.96s)]
*  And you're like, motherfucker, like you're just you're you're off. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2527.6s)]
*  Right. Because you have to be so ready to go. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2530.28s)]
*  And it's slower than it should be. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2532.96s)]
*  So it's fucking with your computer. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2535.76s)]
*  And I think I think the Chinese came up with the loop in table tennis. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2537.2400000000002s)]
*  I believe that in beach volleyball, the jumping serve where you go airborne [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2541.92s)]
*  and then you hit these these discrete technical changes. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2547.36s)]
*  Let's take the one with Steph Curry. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2553.84s)]
*  I heard I wish I could remember who this was. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2556.28s)]
*  Somebody in your audience will know there was an old style [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2558.04s)]
*  top basketball players being interviewed. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2561.2000000000003s)]
*  What do you think of this guy, Steph Curry, and what's happening in the game? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2563.0s)]
*  And he said something so beautiful, I can't tell you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2565.96s)]
*  Something to the effect of, you know, I don't know what game that is. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2569.92s)]
*  He said, I used to play in the paint. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2573.8s)]
*  And we were all, you know, we're going at it and elbowing and trying to get position. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  This guy's a million miles away from the basket. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2580.76s)]
*  And he's just nothing but net. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2583.16s)]
*  He said, that's not basketball to me. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2585.84s)]
*  Like, he just didn't recognize what the thing had become. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2588.48s)]
*  Oh, that's so weird. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2592.12s)]
*  And so I think these zero day exploits and just taking back to get to the to the UFOs, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2593.4s)]
*  because we have crazy stuff. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2599.4s)]
*  The neutron is a zero day exploit. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2601.44s)]
*  It's the Fosbury flop of physics, same for the semiconductor. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2604.44s)]
*  And we have stagnated for so long [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2608.44s)]
*  that people in our government aren't watching people like me [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2612.08s)]
*  and saying, what's going on, Eric? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2616.52s)]
*  Anything new? And what are you working on? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2618.1200000000003s)]
*  Because anybody who comes up with a new thing [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2619.8s)]
*  can change the entire balance of power on planet Earth. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2623.1200000000003s)]
*  How far away are we from new things and have new things been? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2627.2000000000003s)]
*  Can't ask me that, because I have a different view than every other person. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2631.88s)]
*  I want to get back to you. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2634.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm going to ask you. Let's do it. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2635.28s)]
*  Don't tell me what I can ask you. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2636.44s)]
*  I'm asking you that, bro. OK. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2638.1200000000003s)]
*  It kicks you ahead. Keep going. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2641.6000000000004s)]
*  We'll get back to me asking you that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2643.48s)]
*  Yeah, you can ask me at the end. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2644.84s)]
*  But I want to do the stuff that's controversial, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2646.28s)]
*  but is like everybody should have to agree to it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2648.6000000000004s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2650.88s)]
*  So what I wanted to know was why during the 1950s [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  did something happen that resulted in a 70 year stagnation [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2658.32s)]
*  in a field called quantum gravity? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2662.8s)]
*  Quantum gravity is like a startup that cannot ship a product after 70 years. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2665.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's still taken over in theoretical physics [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2670.88s)]
*  as sort of the prestige theory field. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2673.88s)]
*  And quantum gravity, is there an application for this [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2677.32s)]
*  that they were attempting to achieve? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2681.0800000000004s)]
*  No. It's not a precursor to technology so far as we know. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2685.88s)]
*  But what happened was you probably have some dim memory of something. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2691.76s)]
*  By the way, these shooting stars in your ceiling. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2695.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be warned. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2697.0800000000004s)]
*  Otherwise you're like, oh, oh. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2698.92s)]
*  Quantum gravity is the replacement of something [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2702.2000000000003s)]
*  for the replacement for something that used to be known as the unified field. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2706.7200000000003s)]
*  So Einstein wasn't chasing quantum gravity. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2711.08s)]
*  He was chasing unified field theory. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2713.28s)]
*  And unified field theory was much closer to what we would call classical physics, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2716.32s)]
*  where you get quantum field theory by quantizing a classical theory. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2721.8s)]
*  That fell out of favor. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2725.88s)]
*  That fell out of favor. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2727.52s)]
*  And around 1984, we gradually had unified field theory [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2729.68s)]
*  become sort of like a joke, old-timey expression for the future of physics. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2736.68s)]
*  And we substituted quantum gravity for the merger of quantum theory, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2740.88s)]
*  quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2745.76s)]
*  and gravitational physics under general relativity. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2747.4s)]
*  That program, that dog doesn't hunt. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2751.12s)]
*  And it hasn't hunted for 70 years. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2754.48s)]
*  So I wanted to trace this back. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2756.56s)]
*  How is it that the field became convinced [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2758.44s)]
*  that something which clearly doesn't seem to work [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  and has had all of the resources, all of the best minds at its disposal, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2764.12s)]
*  it sucks up everything, and it just doesn't work? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2768.32s)]
*  Why can't I question this? Where did this come from? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2772.68s)]
*  So to be specific, how many people are working on this problem? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2775.68s)]
*  And how many people have been working on this problem for 70 years [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2780.68s)]
*  without progress? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2784.12s)]
*  I would say that the period between 1953 and 73, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2785.04s)]
*  there are parallel things. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2789.2s)]
*  Quantum gravity is not the mainstream at all. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2790.64s)]
*  So real physics is happening between 53 and 73 [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2794.68s)]

*  Between 1973 and 1984, or let's say 74 to 84, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2801.16s)]
*  because we'll group 73 with 53, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2806.7599999999998s)]
*  you have 10 years of super exciting guesses [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2809.76s)]
*  about the extension of our understanding. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  Things called supersymmetry, grand unified theory, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2816.8s)]
*  technicolor, asymptotic safety. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2819.48s)]
*  These are really responsible guesses, axions. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2822.96s)]
*  And somebody like Sean Carroll or Neil deGrasse Tyson [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2827.0800000000004s)]
*  might talk to you about these things when they come in here. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2830.6800000000003s)]
*  In 1984, there's an earthquake called the anomaly cancellation. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2834.0400000000004s)]
*  And a failed theory of strong physics, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2840.32s)]
*  the physics needed to glue two protons together [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2844.5200000000004s)]
*  in a helium nucleus because they both hate each other [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2847.0400000000004s)]
*  because of electromagnetism and want to separate, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2849.5200000000004s)]
*  but something is binding them together [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2851.76s)]
*  like a family structure, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2853.4s)]
*  That force we initially tried to fix [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2856.2000000000003s)]
*  by thinking of it as strings. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2859.5200000000004s)]
*  We'll put like elastic bands between things [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2860.8s)]
*  and it'll pull things back together. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2862.8s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2865.0400000000004s)]
*  But then we repurposed it and said, no, no, no, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2866.44s)]
*  it's quantum gravity. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2868.56s)]
*  And one single individual who is the most dominant mind [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  on planet earth at the moment, effectively Voldemort, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2875.6s)]
*  the person whose name we are a little bit afraid to invoke [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2879.68s)]
*  and cause wrath, said in 1984, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2882.52s)]
*  no, string theory is the way, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2886.08s)]
*  this anomaly cancellation was unexpected. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2887.44s)]
*  And it clearly points to the fact that we are, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2889.84s)]
*  ladies and gentlemen, we are about to quantize. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2891.72s)]
*  Who's that person? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  Edward Witten. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2894.56s)]
*  And in physics circles, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2896.32s)]
*  you're not allowed to bring this guy up? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  We talk about him. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2901.32s)]
*  Everybody talks about him, but to challenge him, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2902.2400000000002s)]
*  think about Agent Smith. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2906.48s)]
*  Think about playing one-on-one [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2908.6s)]
*  with Michael Jordan in his prime. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2910.7200000000003s)]
*  He's that good. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2914.28s)]
*  Joe, I'm dumb enough not to be intellectually afraid [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2915.6800000000003s)]
*  of anyone else on planet earth at this point. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2919.6800000000003s)]
*  I am terrified of this person. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2922.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2924.68s)]
*  I've said he's the Michael Jordan of theoretical physics, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2926.8399999999997s)]
*  if only Michael Jordan could play better basketball. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2929.3999999999996s)]
*  Pfft. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2932.48s)]
*  I'm not kidding around, Joe. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2935.56s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2936.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2937.48s)]
*  Right, this good. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2938.3199999999997s)]
*  And has never made contact with the physical world. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2939.68s)]
*  So it's like one of the greatest conundrums. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2944.6s)]
*  So let me get back to how crazy- [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  What do you mean by never made contact? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  No Nobel Prize, never predicted something [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2951.3599999999997s)]
*  that turned out to be true, never pointed us [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2953.96s)]
*  to do an experiment that was invalidated. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2956.04s)]
*  So 100% of his efforts have been [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2959.28s)]
*  not making contact with physical reality. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2965.48s)]
*  Oh, this is, I'm sorry. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2972.32s)]
*  Like you have people like Michio Kaku [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2974.84s)]
*  who are in the string theoretic school, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2976.48s)]
*  Sean Carroll is very sympathetic to it. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2978.64s)]
*  You need to understand this story. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2981.2400000000002s)]
*  Jamie, if I dare, may I ask, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2984.76s)]
*  can we pull up something with Edward Witten [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2987.08s)]
*  and Abdus Salam on YouTube? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2989.04s)]
*  Just to, like this person's voice. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2992.32s)]
*  Imagine a six foot four person who talks like this. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2995.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=2999.32s)]
*  And just like, you could do a Vulcan mind meld [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3000.16s)]
*  and rearrange your mind into scrambled eggs within seconds. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3003.32s)]
*  I know tenured professors who hid in their offices [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3006.36s)]
*  when he visited MIT because he walked on everybody, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3010.12s)]
*  he knocked on everyone's door. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3012.92s)]
*  And he has, you know how Warren Beatty had a pickup line [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3014.52s)]
*  that everyone knew? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3017.08s)]
*  What's new, pussycat? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3018.76s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3020.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was Warren Beatty's pickup line. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3020.92s)]
*  It's all you needed when you were Warren Beatty. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3022.52s)]
*  That's true. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3024.2000000000003s)]
*  Try that shit if you work at 7-Eleven. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3025.04s)]
*  This person. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3026.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let me hear him. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3027.04s)]
*  Pretty weird way for a theory to start. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3027.88s)]
*  String theory started with a clever formula [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3029.84s)]
*  written down by Veneziano in an effort to satisfy [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3033.0s)]
*  not so well motivated phenomenological ideas [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3036.04s)]
*  about strong interactions gathering. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3038.7200000000003s)]
*  That was a way for a theory to start [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  which was as strange as the way quantum mechanics started. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3042.08s)]
*  And the way Einstein happened to have invented a theory [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3045.12s)]
*  in a particularly striking triumph of reason and intuition. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3049.56s)]
*  But most other physical theories [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3056.52s)]
*  have had more complicated. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3058.2799999999997s)]
*  You can tell how much is going on beyond this. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3059.12s)]
*  And it's hard to make a theory about them. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3061.08s)]
*  You can't generalize at all of how invention will come. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3062.48s)]
*  Anybody who makes statements like that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3066.64s)]
*  is by his own experience. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3068.56s)]
*  That is Abdus-Salam Nobel Prize winner. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3071.44s)]
*  This must be modified according to each situation. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3073.28s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3076.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, it still seems to me it's a question [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3077.36s)]
*  of whether you start with a mathematical scheme [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3079.32s)]
*  and then look for a physical interpretation [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3082.2000000000003s)]
*  or start with a physical principle [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3084.76s)]
*  which you guess to be correct. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3086.52s)]
*  And then on the one hand, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3088.48s)]
*  try and prove it experimentally to be true. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3089.8s)]
*  And on the other hand, codify it into a mathematical form. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3092.0s)]
*  I must admit I've always been so admiring [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3096.88s)]
*  of Einstein's procedure in general relativity [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3100.2799999999997s)]
*  of starting with a very simple physical remark [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3102.6s)]
*  based on the Galileo discovery [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3105.3999999999996s)]
*  that bodies of different mass fall at the same rate [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3108.08s)]
*  in the gravitational field of the earth. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3110.72s)]
*  He made a simple physical hypothesis [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3113.4799999999996s)]
*  why that should be true. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3115.4399999999996s)]
*  You have to understand. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3117.3599999999997s)]
*  You know that old Jim Croce song about Big Jim? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3119.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3121.8799999999997s)]
*  When the bad folks all get together at night, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3122.72s)]
*  they all call Big Jim boss. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3123.64s)]
*  If you ask any of us who are any good, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3125.8799999999997s)]
*  who's the person who terrifies you the most? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3131.08s)]
*  So are these guys debating him? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3133.68s)]
*  Is this what's going on? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3135.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3136.2s)]
*  Are they agreeing with him? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3137.2s)]
*  Are they questioning him? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3138.12s)]
*  They're having a friendly conversation. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3138.9599999999996s)]
*  Right, should we let it go more? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3140.2799999999997s)]
*  Up to you, but I would concentrate. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3143.12s)]
*  The other people are very interesting, top people. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3144.9599999999996s)]
*  This person is a towering 17 stories above everybody else. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3147.64s)]
*  Let me hear him talk more. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  Because it seemed very fascinating [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3155.4399999999996s)]
*  watching the way he was talking about things. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3157.2s)]
*  It almost seems like he wanted to run away [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3159.36s)]
*  and get back to his lab. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3160.92s)]
*  Be with you, except that I think it would have taken [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  more time. Longer, yes. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3165.1200000000003s)]
*  You see, Riemann almost did it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3167.4s)]
*  Riemann almost did it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3169.6400000000003s)]
*  Riemann had the conception that gravity [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3170.48s)]
*  was based on curved space time. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3172.2000000000003s)]
*  But what he lacked, sorry, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3174.1200000000003s)]
*  Riemann had the conception that gravity [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3175.56s)]
*  was based on curved space. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3177.08s)]
*  He didn't conceive of curved space time [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3179.04s)]
*  because special relativity hadn't happened yet. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3181.04s)]
*  So time and space hadn't been unified. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3183.0s)]
*  But if Riemann had lived after special relativity, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3185.0s)]
*  he might well have lived. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  And we're talking about the announcement, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3188.88s)]
*  even the extensions, you remember. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3190.04s)]
*  So I don't think it's such a cut and dried case ever. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3191.48s)]
*  Let me give you one more example, if I may. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3196.28s)]
*  Find some more Ed. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3199.76s)]
*  So should we get a different video of him? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3202.44s)]
*  Or just, you can find a lecture of him [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3204.84s)]
*  where he's alone. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3207.1200000000003s)]
*  But just let him yap a little bit. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3207.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3210.1600000000003s)]
*  You outside the field, a winner [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3213.2400000000002s)]
*  of the fundamental physics prize, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3215.6400000000003s)]
*  a $3 million prize recently established [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3217.4s)]
*  by Yuri Milner to. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3219.96s)]
*  Matter equivalent of the electron, the positron. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3221.48s)]
*  So this is him. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3224.2400000000002s)]
*  A particle like the electron, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3225.08s)]
*  but with the opposite electric charge. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3225.92s)]
*  So this was actually the discovery of antimatter. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3229.56s)]
*  The most basic property of antimatter [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3232.52s)]
*  is that matter-antimatter pairs [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3234.76s)]
*  can be created and annihilated. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3236.4s)]
*  In this picture, time is running horizontally. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3238.76s)]
*  And what I'm sketching, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3241.6s)]
*  the purple wiggly lines are meant to be photons. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3244.88s)]
*  Physicists often, in drawing so-called Feynman diagrams, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3247.4s)]
*  use wiggly lines to indicate photons. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3250.48s)]
*  Here, two photons are annihilating [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3252.6400000000003s)]
*  into an electron-positron pair. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3255.2000000000003s)]
*  So photons are as close to pure energy as it gets, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3258.04s)]
*  and they can be converted to matter [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3261.1600000000003s)]
*  that is into antimatter-matter pairs. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3263.08s)]
*  Imagine dating this guy's daughter [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3265.48s)]
*  and you have to meet him. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  Hi, sir. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3269.2400000000002s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3270.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you do at work? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3271.32s)]
*  I've tangled with him twice. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3278.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't, look, two friends of mine are his graduate students. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3281.2000000000003s)]
*  He's had two graduate students in mathematics. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3285.84s)]
*  He's not even a mathematician. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3288.6800000000003s)]
*  He's won the Fields Medal. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3290.1200000000003s)]
*  He's never won the Nobel Prize, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3291.1200000000003s)]
*  but he's won the highest prize [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3292.1600000000003s)]
*  in all of mathematics as a sideline. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3293.6000000000004s)]
*  Didn't even major in physics, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3295.88s)]
*  majored in history at Brandeis. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3297.1200000000003s)]
*  They're fried. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3299.48s)]
*  They're brains. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3300.7599999999998s)]
*  Everybody who comes in contact with this person [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3302.12s)]
*  just never fully recovers. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3305.04s)]
*  Because he's that much smarter. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3307.2799999999997s)]
*  We don't know what process he's running. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3308.96s)]
*  I mean, imagine that you had like a machine to, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3312.16s)]
*  imagine you had like Chet GPT in your ear. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3314.12s)]
*  Nobody else did, and nobody knows how you're doing it. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3318.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3321.12s)]
*  I wouldn't say that he's that way now. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3322.12s)]
*  The younger version of him was much more unusual. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3324.08s)]
*  He would just spontaneously laugh [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3327.4399999999996s)]
*  in the middle of a sentence for no reason. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3329.16s)]
*  It was just very clear that you weren't communicating [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3333.12s)]
*  with somebody who was with you in the room. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3335.3199999999997s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3338.08s)]
*  Yeah, he seemed like the way he was sitting there, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3339.2s)]
*  grasping his hands, and he seemed like very uncomfortable [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3342.9199999999996s)]
*  just to be around all these people. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3347.3999999999996s)]
*  I was at the University of Pennsylvania [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3349.16s)]
*  in like 1982 through 85, okay? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3351.08s)]
*  And I went to a lecture that he gave, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3355.36s)]
*  and he said things like, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3357.8s)]
*  well, as every school child and quantum field theorist knows, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3359.56s)]
*  mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3364.56s)]
*  Yeah, just like spontaneously laughing for no reason. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3365.68s)]
*  The number of generations is tied to the index [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3368.16s)]
*  of an elliptic operator on the Calabi-Yau manifold. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3371.24s)]
*  And the guy next to me says, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3374.68s)]
*  I've been a quantum field theorist for 40 years. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3377.6s)]
*  I don't know any of this stuff. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3380.36s)]
*  40 years, I don't know any of this stuff. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3382.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3384.88s)]
*  Right, so he came onto the scene [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3385.72s)]
*  and started telling us how everything [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3388.2799999999997s)]
*  was gonna fit together. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3390.12s)]
*  And nobody had ever heard a story like this. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3391.6s)]
*  This is, by the way, lost to history [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3393.92s)]
*  because we fictionalized what happened with string theory. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3396.88s)]
*  This person was so far ahead [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3399.72s)]
*  that nobody wanted to contradict him. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3402.44s)]
*  He said this was the way. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3406.0s)]
*  There are five string theories or whatever there are, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3407.48s)]
*  six, four, I can't remember. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3409.6s)]
*  And it's gonna be one of them, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3411.52s)]
*  and in 10 years we'll have the whole thing wrapped up. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3412.64s)]
*  And everybody wanted to be on the winning team [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3415.6s)]
*  knew that they weren't gonna go up against this [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3418.0s)]
*  because they couldn't even figure out [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3419.96s)]
*  how he was doing what he was doing. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3421.72s)]
*  And what was really going on [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3423.64s)]
*  was very different than people understood. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3425.44s)]
*  Quantum field theory, which is now claimed [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3429.0s)]
*  by most physicists to be the most advanced theory we have [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3431.56s)]
*  at the time was sort of a grab bag of different techniques. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3435.36s)]
*  You know, just like not unified. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3439.0s)]
*  He saw that this was effectively a coherent whole [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3442.48s)]
*  and with help from a couple of other people [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3449.32s)]
*  who are often not as well acknowledged, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3451.32s)]
*  one of which would be Michael Attia, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3452.92s)]
*  another which would be Graham Siegel, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3455.84s)]
*  another which would be Dan Quillen, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3457.8s)]
*  and my good friend and postdoctoral advisor Isadora Singer. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3459.8s)]
*  So there's sort of a small cabal of people [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3464.32s)]
*  who figured out that quantum field theory [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3467.12s)]
*  was not only a coherent story, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3470.04s)]
*  it didn't really have to do with physics at all. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  It was like calculus. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3475.44s)]
*  You can use calculus to do physics, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3476.92s)]
*  in fact, you can't do physics without it. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3478.48s)]
*  But you can also use calculus to optimize inventory [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3481.36s)]
*  and make your profits go up. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3483.92s)]
*  And so as a result, quantum field theory was discovered [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3486.96s)]
*  not to be physical. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3490.2000000000003s)]
*  It was a framework that you, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3491.36s)]
*  one physical input to that machine [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3493.28s)]
*  probably generates the world. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3495.6400000000003s)]
*  But the machine itself isn't about physics. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3498.28s)]
*  So this was the most romantic backfiring [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3501.48s)]
*  in the history of physics in a certain sense. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3504.96s)]
*  These guys set out to say, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3506.92s)]
*  we are going to quantize gravity. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3508.08s)]
*  In other words, quantize geometry, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3510.2400000000002s)]
*  the geometry of Einstein and Riemann. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3512.1600000000003s)]
*  And what happened was exactly the reverse. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3515.36s)]
*  They gravitized the quantum, they geometrized the quantum. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3517.32s)]
*  So it's been remarkably productive. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3522.0s)]
*  The reason we can say how brilliant this person is [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3524.2400000000002s)]
*  because he geometrized the quantum [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3526.68s)]
*  at a level that we didn't know was possible. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3528.56s)]
*  On the other hand, he never made contact [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3531.44s)]
*  with physical reality the way he was expecting [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3533.4s)]
*  and promising to do. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  So he's both the most accomplished of us [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3536.6s)]
*  and the person who drove physics the most off of the road. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3540.08s)]
*  And if you attempt to give him his due, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3544.12s)]
*  and you don't, if you're not comfortable [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3546.36s)]
*  citing both of these things, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3548.2799999999997s)]
*  you can't be an accurate historian, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3549.36s)]
*  but he's still running around [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3550.7999999999997s)]
*  and nobody wants to go up against him. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3552.04s)]
*  How old is he now? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3554.8399999999997s)]
*  He was born in 1951, so he'll be turning 72, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3557.32s)]
*  I think later this year, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3560.84s)]
*  And then we get to the really crazy part. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3563.76s)]
*  Quantum gravity is really due to two families. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3567.2s)]
*  One is a husband and wife team [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3572.96s)]
*  and the other is father son. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3574.52s)]
*  The husband and wife team were named Bryce Dewitt, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3577.0s)]
*  formerly, I think, Bryce Seligman, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3580.4s)]
*  don't know why he changed his name, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3582.16s)]
*  and his wife Cecile Dewitt or Cecile Dewitt-Mourette. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3584.0s)]
*  And the father son team was Lewis Whitten, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3588.04s)]
*  who is still alive, now 101 years old, and Edward Whitten. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3590.56s)]
*  And then the really weird stuff happens. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3595.84s)]
*  And this is why I was curious about UFOs [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3599.36s)]
*  and gravity and all this stuff. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3602.28s)]
*  The actual genesis of these two families [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3604.76s)]
*  having this outsized impact [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3607.0s)]
*  on the future of theoretical physics [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3608.68s)]
*  comes from two different people [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3611.32s)]
*  who are almost never talked about. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3612.68s)]
*  Matter of fact, most physicists have no idea their names. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3614.24s)]
*  One is named Agnew Bainson [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3616.3199999999997s)]
*  and the other is named Roger Babson. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3618.56s)]
*  And these two guys were deep into anti-gravity. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3622.3599999999997s)]
*  So the world's greatest mind [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3627.3199999999997s)]
*  and greatest living theoretical physics mind [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3629.16s)]
*  is the son of the most prominent anti-gravity researcher, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3631.7999999999997s)]
*  I swear, I kid you not, from the 1950s. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3636.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3639.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3642.1600000000003s)]
*  Now there's an official story about this, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3644.84s)]
*  an official story that both the Dewitts tell [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3646.6800000000003s)]
*  and the Whittins tell is, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3649.96s)]
*  oh yeah, there were these crazy people, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3652.8s)]
*  they were very embarrassing, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3654.32s)]
*  they were always focused on anti-gravity. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3655.48s)]
*  But we were clever enough to defraud them of their money [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3658.28s)]
*  to do real gravitational research, ha ha ha. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3662.48s)]
*  They both said that, both families? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3665.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, they didn't use defraud. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3666.92s)]
*  But that's kind of what they implied? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3669.08s)]
*  That's correct, because it's an embarrassment. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3670.4s)]
*  And in order to understand this hugely productive period [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3672.92s)]
*  relative to the stagnation, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3676.7599999999998s)]
*  the stagnation is incredibly high prestige. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3678.72s)]
*  Like most of the positions [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3682.2s)]
*  at the Institute for Advanced Study, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3683.7999999999997s)]
*  the top physics department, ostensibly, in the world, right? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3685.8399999999997s)]
*  You had a director named Robert Dijkgraaf, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3689.4s)]
*  you had a director named Robert Dijkgraaf, string theorist, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3692.3199999999997s)]
*  you had Edward Whitten, string theorist, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3696.52s)]
*  Natty Syberg, string theorist, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3698.64s)]
*  Juan Maldacena, string theorist, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3701.8399999999997s)]
*  and you had this guy, Nima Arkani-Hamed, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3704.3599999999997s)]
*  who I hope you will have on this program, who is amazing, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3706.64s)]
*  who is not a string theorist, but very string sympathetic. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3709.56s)]
*  This thing dominated, it just took over. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3714.8399999999997s)]
*  And this weird genesis of a high prestige field [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3717.52s)]
*  that can't accomplish what it's setting out to accomplish [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3724.44s)]
*  is in contrast to this mixed period between 1953 and 1973, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3727.92s)]
*  where you have the world's most prestigious physicists [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3732.7599999999998s)]
*  palling around with pseudoscience, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3736.08s)]
*  UFO-type stuff, gravity shielding, all this stuff. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3741.32s)]
*  So Babson is so crazy, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3746.28s)]
*  you can't even believe the story is true, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3748.96s)]
*  but he claims that his sister drowned in a pond [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3752.32s)]
*  because even though she was a good swimmer, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3755.1600000000003s)]
*  she couldn't overcome gravity. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3756.6800000000003s)]
*  So gravity becomes his sworn enemy, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3758.32s)]
*  and he's gonna use his fortune that he's predicted from, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3760.92s)]
*  that he's gotten from predicting the crash of 1929 [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3765.0s)]
*  because of Newton's laws, what goes up must come down, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3767.8s)]
*  so he gets out of the stock market six months early. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3769.88s)]
*  Babson makes a fortune. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3773.4s)]
*  He, Edison, and Clarence Birdeye of frozen food fame [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3775.28s)]
*  form this sort of little intellectual collective [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3781.08s)]
*  where they're gonna defeat gravity. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3783.04s)]
*  So for example, just because people are gonna say, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3784.56s)]
*  Eric, this is all nonsense, and it isn't. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3786.6800000000003s)]
*  Jamie, is it possible to pull up a stone monument [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3789.44s)]
*  at Tufts University to the anti-gravity that was done there, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3792.7200000000003s)]
*  so put in Tufts stone anti-gravity? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3796.28s)]
*  This guy littered universities all across the country [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3799.6400000000003s)]
*  with these monuments to prove that this anti-gravity stuff [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  was actually taking place at American universities, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3808.52s)]
*  and he established an essay contest. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3814.2000000000003s)]
*  All right, so check this out. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3818.0s)]
*  This monument has been directed [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3818.84s)]
*  by the Gravity Research Foundation, Roger Babson, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3820.28s)]
*  founder to remind students of the blessings forthcoming [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3822.36s)]
*  when science determines what gravity is and how it works, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3824.88s)]
*  and how it may be controlled. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3827.84s)]
*  This is about UFOs and the idea that we are gonna harness [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3830.76s)]
*  the power of gravity and we're going to get [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3835.76s)]
*  a supreme advantage, and these stones are littered [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3837.6400000000003s)]
*  around the country. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3841.88s)]
*  Here's another one. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3845.1200000000003s)]
*  So this is not widely known [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3846.6400000000003s)]
*  that this research is being done. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3848.28s)]
*  This is hugely embarrassing to us. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3849.76s)]
*  Hugely embarrassing because it hasn't yielded results? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3851.76s)]
*  No, hugely embarrassing because it carries the stench [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3854.1600000000003s)]
*  of pseudoscience. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3857.36s)]
*  See, when people don't like me coming on your program [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3858.96s)]
*  and saying things that nobody else in the world is saying, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  they call me a pseudoscientist or that's crackpot, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3864.1200000000003s)]
*  and these words, you don't take them that serious. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3867.6s)]
*  We had this discussion before with Tim Dillon [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3870.1200000000003s)]
*  saying something about me. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3872.4s)]

*  Academics play these games with each other [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3876.6400000000003s)]
*  where we try to push each other out of the ring [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3879.56s)]
*  like sumo wrestlers, and the way you push somebody out [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3881.8s)]
*  is you say, oh, that guy's a crackpot. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3884.04s)]
*  He's a grifter. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3885.56s)]

*  He's nutty, he's a nutter. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3888.44s)]
*  Bullshit. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3891.12s)]
*  This was the marriage of the ultimate nuttiness [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3892.24s)]
*  with the highest prestige physics we know how to do. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3895.68s)]
*  Was this considered nuttiness in 64, though? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3900.28s)]
*  This is the interesting question. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3903.44s)]
*  In the middle of the 1950s, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3904.72s)]
*  this is mainstream in newspapers, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3907.48s)]
*  but, for example, Bryce DeWitt, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3910.36s)]
*  so here's how the two stories cross. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3913.36s)]
*  You start off with Babson and Bainson. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3915.88s)]
*  They're the money. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3919.08s)]
*  Babson found something called [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3921.44s)]
*  the Gravity Research Foundation in New Boston, New Hampshire, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3923.52s)]
*  and he gets the Glenn L. Martin Company, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3927.1200000000003s)]
*  which is the precursor of Martin Marietta, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3930.04s)]

*  Do you know this stuff? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3934.48s)]
*  No. Okay. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3935.32s)]
*  He gets them to hire Lewis Whitten out of Johns Hopkins. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3938.04s)]
*  Lewis Whitten is a respectable physicist [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3942.48s)]
*  who takes the position and forms something [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3945.28s)]
*  called the Research Institute for Advanced Study. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3947.8s)]
*  Now, you've probably heard of Bell Labs or Xerox PARC, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3950.56s)]
*  and you probably haven't heard [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3953.68s)]
*  of the Research Institute for Advanced Study. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3954.88s)]
*  Yet, this has illustrious names associated with it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3957.96s)]
*  Solomon Lefcets, the great topologist, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3962.64s)]

*  there's no shortage. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3974.9199999999996s)]
*  Sheldon Glashow, who discovers spontaneous symmetry breaking [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3975.8799999999997s)]

*  It has a campus in Baltimore, Maryland [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3984.4399999999996s)]
*  that, you know, I can tell you the address at some point. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3987.0s)]
*  We pretend that it didn't happen and doesn't exist. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3990.56s)]
*  But for example, if you were to look at Brown University, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3994.76s)]
*  Brown University has something called [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3997.6400000000003s)]
*  the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=3999.2400000000002s)]
*  And the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics is the spin out [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4001.6400000000003s)]
*  from the Research Institute of Advanced Study [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4005.1200000000003s)]
*  of Solomon Lefcets, the great topologist's work [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4007.1600000000003s)]

*  dynamical systems. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4013.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's this marriage of utter madness and kookiness [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4016.4s)]
*  with top drawer white shoe respectability. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4020.6000000000004s)]
*  So this was my puzzle about UFOs. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4025.2400000000002s)]
*  What was this anti-gravity thing between 53 and 73? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4029.28s)]
*  And the reason it ends in 1973 [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4033.36s)]
*  is a guy named Mike Mansfield, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4036.0s)]
*  I think of Montana as a senator, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4038.84s)]
*  passes something called the Mansfield Amendment, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4040.5200000000004s)]
*  which discontinues Army or Department of Defense [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4043.76s)]
*  military funding for blue sky research [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4048.4s)]
*  inside of our universities. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4050.6400000000003s)]
*  And what is blue sky research? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4053.12s)]
*  Hey, you're a young person, you're super smart, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4055.88s)]
*  here's a pile of money, don't even tell us [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4058.16s)]
*  what you're working on, we just believe in you go to it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4060.6s)]
*  This is what caused us to be the envy of the effing world, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4063.16s)]
*  cowboy science. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4066.16s)]
*  We were wild, okay? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4068.44s)]
*  We had skirt chasing, hard drinking, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4071.12s)]
*  charismatic, brilliant human beings who answered to no one [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4074.72s)]
*  and walked around with swagger with their shoulders back [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4078.8399999999997s)]
*  and their chest puffed out. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4082.8s)]
*  Because around Sputnik, we wanted the best of the best [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4084.36s)]
*  to go into science. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4087.56s)]
*  Around 1973, we discontinue this, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4090.04s)]
*  we start talking about Golden Fleece Awards, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4093.12s)]
*  how did you waste the taxpayers' money? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4095.0s)]
*  And we become incapable of equaling the performances, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4097.92s)]
*  like we worship Ted Williams because nobody's turned in [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4104.08s)]
*  a Ted Williams style performance in ages. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4107.36s)]
*  Even Ed Witten can't do it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4112.12s)]
*  In any era before this, Ed Witten would have won [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4114.04s)]
*  a Nobel Prize, the guy six months older than he is [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4116.28s)]
*  from 1951, a guy named Frank Wilczek who won [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4119.92s)]
*  the Nobel Prize, even being a tiny bit older [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4122.52s)]
*  than Ed Witten, you know, Frank is brilliant, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4126.4800000000005s)]
*  but he's not Ed Witten like, he got a Nobel Prize [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4130.24s)]
*  for something called asymptotic freedom [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4133.72s)]
*  in strong interactions. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4136.24s)]
*  This new found impotence, let's just call it impotence, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4139.0s)]
*  it's like you turned the world's most vital people [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4143.24s)]
*  into castrati and you did it by accounting [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4146.92s)]
*  for their dollars, making them say how everything [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4152.16s)]
*  they did had a practical application, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4156.12s)]
*  defending the purpose of blue sky research [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4158.28s)]
*  as if they were wasting taxpayer dollars, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4161.8s)]
*  they got called welfare queens and white lab coats. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4163.8s)]
*  The whole thing is completely ridiculous, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4167.84s)]
*  but we have been in the process of dismantling [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4169.64s)]
*  the world's most productive, powerful scientific enterprise [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4171.8s)]
*  from really 1965 or 73 till the present day. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4175.84s)]
*  And the 65 date dates from Ghislaine Maxwell's father. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4182.360000000001s)]
*  Robert Maxwell is basically the son of a bitch [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4186.96s)]
*  who introduced peer review, which had only really [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4190.8s)]
*  been strong in the biomedical literature. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4193.320000000001s)]
*  Intergeneral science, because he figured out [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4196.5s)]
*  how to make a fortune hacking the universities. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4199.46s)]
*  If you're a university, if you wanna have [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4203.22s)]
*  a complete library, you have to buy all the journals [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4204.74s)]
*  the paper is appearing. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4207.54s)]
*  So he said, great news, I'll jack up the prices [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4209.26s)]
*  and jack up the number of journals. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4211.9s)]
*  I'll just explode the number of journals. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4214.26s)]
*  And every university that doesn't want to be incomplete [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4216.3s)]
*  has to buy my product. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4219.9s)]
*  So suddenly there weren't enough good editors [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4221.820000000001s)]
*  to edit all of these tiny micro journals, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4225.46s)]
*  journal of hyper specific thing X. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4227.860000000001s)]
*  So peer review comes screaming in in 1965 [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4231.26s)]
*  through his company, Maxwell's company [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4236.7s)]
*  called Pergamon Press. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4238.9400000000005s)]
*  So Ghislaine Maxwell's father is like [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4242.66s)]
*  the first major attack on science. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4244.900000000001s)]
*  And then the Mansfield Amendment comes in, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4248.06s)]
*  there's something called the Eilberg Amendment in 1973. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4249.78s)]
*  In 1980, there's something called the Beidol Amendment. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4252.179999999999s)]
*  Then there's the Immigration Act of 1990. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4254.82s)]
*  And we're just chipping away [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4256.62s)]
*  at the vitality of American cowboy science. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4259.3s)]
*  So right now, if you go into a science department, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4261.94s)]
*  the whole question is, well, what have you done [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4263.86s)]
*  for diversity, inclusion and equity? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4265.099999999999s)]
*  Let's agree that there's no lone geniuses in the world [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4268.5s)]
*  as if we didn't have Einstein and von Neumann [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4271.86s)]
*  and Teller and all these people. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4273.86s)]
*  Everything is communal, everything is in the air. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4276.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like nobody wants to work in this environment. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4278.38s)]
*  Nobody good, right? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4280.34s)]
*  So whatever it is, we have been devitalizing [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4282.78s)]
*  certainly since 1973 for 50 years, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4285.78s)]
*  but also really since 1965. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4288.1s)]
*  How do you turn that boat around though? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4290.74s)]
*  We're doing whatever we can. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4292.66s)]
*  Like if you're rich and you're smart and you're connected, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4294.66s)]
*  if you're part of some secret program [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4297.74s)]
*  and you're watching this, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4299.46s)]
*  please reach out to the Joe Rogan Experiencer, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4300.900000000001s)]
*  Eric Weinstein to turn the ship around. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4303.38s)]
*  But let's keep going [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4305.58s)]
*  because I wanna get to the UFOs again. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4306.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4307.78s)]
*  So my question was, what is going on with antigravity, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4310.66s)]
*  UFOs, the world's smartest human beings between 1953 and 73? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4315.26s)]
*  Somebody help me out. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4321.54s)]
*  Why two families, the Dewitts and the Wittens? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4324.34s)]
*  And let me give you the reason [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4327.74s)]
*  that I didn't wanna touch this subject. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4329.5s)]
*  The reason I didn't wanna touch the subject [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4332.58s)]
*  has to do with something I learned from World War II. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4334.18s)]
*  So you probably know the code name for D-Day? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4337.700000000001s)]
*  No. Operation Overlord. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4341.5s)]
*  There was a companion thing called Operation Bodyguard [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4344.860000000001s)]
*  and in particular Operation Fortitude, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4348.14s)]
*  which was inside of Operation Bodyguard, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4350.06s)]
*  which was the planned invasion of Norway, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4352.22s)]
*  which was never gonna happen. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4355.5s)]
*  But we faked an entire invasion of Norway [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4357.66s)]
*  because we had a troop buildup in England [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4360.740000000001s)]
*  that was going to be headed into a very narrow place [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4363.46s)]
*  and was gonna be outgunned by the Germans. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4366.54s)]
*  So how do you get all of these people left to fight [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4369.34s)]
*  who have loose lips, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4372.14s)]
*  probably going off and seeing prostitutes? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4373.22s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4375.78s)]
*  Not to blow, spill the beans on D-Day. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4377.1s)]
*  Well, you create an entirely fake invasion of Norway. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4381.26s)]
*  Is it possible to bring up Operation Fortitude [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4385.42s)]
*  just to see a map of this thing? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4387.26s)]
*  So they faked radio chatter, they had inflatable tanks. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4388.74s)]
*  I think there were army divisions that didn't exist. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4392.82s)]
*  Just looking at something, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4395.259999999999s)]
*  it didn't call it what you call it, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4396.54s)]
*  but it's the same stuff. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4397.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4399.34s)]
*  I think this is the map you're talking about. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4400.54s)]
*  Well, that's in Northern France. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4401.98s)]
*  Fortitude would be targeted on- [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4404.98s)]
*  I've seen the inflated tanks. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4406.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny, right? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4408.179999999999s)]
*  That was what it was regarded to. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4409.0199999999995s)]
*  So deception, and we talked about K-Fabe before. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4411.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4414.179999999999s)]
*  Like I'm very focused on it. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4415.0199999999995s)]
*  What I really care about- [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4416.9s)]
*  Look at that, that's hilarious. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4419.099999999999s)]
*  They had a bunch of inflatable tanks. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4421.1s)]
*  So this entire deception had to be parallel. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4423.820000000001s)]
*  Overlord wouldn't have worked without Fortitude. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4429.660000000001s)]
*  Now, if you assume that that's the basic paradigm, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4433.820000000001s)]
*  which is whenever we're gonna do something badass, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4437.22s)]
*  we're also gonna do something fake. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4439.34s)]
*  I thought the UFOs was the Operation Fortitude [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4442.1s)]
*  part of something real. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4444.700000000001s)]
*  This is my bad, I screwed up, Eric failed, blah, blah, blah. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4447.620000000001s)]
*  So you thought, at what point? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4451.900000000001s)]
*  When the New York Times revealed they talked to people [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4456.02s)]
*  in the Pentagon? No, no, no, before that. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4458.14s)]
*  Before that. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4459.06s)]
*  I thought, okay, you wanna develop the SR-71 Blackbird. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4460.02s)]
*  You wanna develop the stealth bomber. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4463.700000000001s)]
*  You want a code, you want a cover program. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4466.820000000001s)]
*  So you're gonna come up with UFOs. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4470.06s)]
*  Somebody sees something in the air. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4471.46s)]
*  Dude, there was a flying triangle. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4473.740000000001s)]
*  I swear to God. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4476.02s)]
*  There was this thing that went so fast [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4477.1s)]
*  I couldn't even believe it. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4478.22s)]
*  Well, one of them's a B-2 bomber, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4479.58s)]
*  the other one is a SR-71 Blackbird. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4482.54s)]
*  Duh. Right. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4485.3s)]
*  So why do I wanna get involved with Operation Fortitude? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4486.62s)]
*  I'm a patriotic American. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4490.94s)]
*  If we're gonna lie about stuff [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4492.46s)]
*  and we're doing it for a good purpose [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4493.86s)]
*  and it's not hurting anybody, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4495.38s)]
*  I don't wanna get involved and say, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4496.46s)]
*  I'm so smart I can figure it out. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4497.58s)]
*  I don't wanna be anywhere near that. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4499.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4500.78s)]
*  So that's what I assumed about UFOs. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4501.62s)]
*  And I goofed. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4503.58s)]
*  So what do you think it is now? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4505.34s)]
*  Well, that's the new question. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4507.3s)]
*  And what made you shift this perspective? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4510.1s)]
*  So there was this weird thing that happened [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4512.82s)]
*  where we announced through the New York Times [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4514.7s)]
*  that this stuff may be more real [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4518.06s)]
*  than anyone cared to imagine. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4520.1s)]
*  And Jeremy Corbell was releasing these videos [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4522.26s)]
*  and who was leaking them, I don't know. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4524.62s)]
*  And the New York Times was authenticating. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4526.14s)]
*  And you get all of this, again, tons of ambiguity. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4528.66s)]
*  So everybody's decision tree blows out. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4532.18s)]
*  Nobody can think straight. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4533.82s)]
*  But I thought, oh no. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4534.82s)]
*  What if the old Feynman stories that I've been following [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4538.26s)]
*  are actually about something rather than about a deception? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4543.7s)]
*  So for example, Feynman has a story where he says, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4547.58s)]
*  hey, there was this guy who was giving physics lectures [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4551.7s)]
*  to aerospace engineers and they didn't like him [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4554.1s)]
*  so I had to go out to Buffalo. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4556.9800000000005s)]
*  I thought, Buffalo, that's Curtis Wright. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4558.38s)]
*  You're going to Curtis Wright Aerospace. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4560.78s)]
*  And he's got another one about, you know, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4563.42s)]
*  give me a dollar because somebody calls him up and says, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4565.74s)]
*  give us the nuclear patents [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4568.46s)]
*  to like fission-driven planes and crazy stuff. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4571.78s)]
*  Feynman is constantly telling us. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4579.94s)]
*  He's got a story called It's Greek to Me [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4583.9s)]
*  where he shows up in North Carolina. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4586.22s)]
*  Can't remember whether he's supposed to go [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4587.7s)]
*  to the University of North Carolina, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4590.3s)]
*  Chapel Hill or Greenville. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  And he has to figure it out and he says, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4594.66s)]
*  oh, I'm late to the conference. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4596.58s)]
*  There would be a bunch of people mumbling the words [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4598.38s)]
*  g mu nu and the guy says, oh, it's Chapel Hill. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4600.099999999999s)]
*  So he goes there. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4602.3s)]
*  Ha ha ha, it's a cute story about how clever Feynman is, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4603.139999999999s)]
*  which they all are. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4605.38s)]
*  But that was a conference sponsored [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4607.58s)]
*  by the Institute for Field Physics [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4610.58s)]
*  at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4612.18s)]
*  sponsored by Agnew Bainson through Bryce DeWitt, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4614.18s)]
*  who is the person who repurposed [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4618.0199999999995s)]
*  the Gravity Research Foundation essay, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4621.22s)]
*  which is only supposed to be about harnessing gravity, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4624.26s)]
*  anti-gravity, anti-gravity devices like UFOs. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4626.46s)]
*  And he said, well, if you really wanna get to anti-gravity, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4629.38s)]
*  you have to do it through quantum gravity, right? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4631.9800000000005s)]
*  Now he did that and then a couple of people [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4635.42s)]
*  from the Institute, it was Arnowitt and Desser, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4637.700000000001s)]
*  entered and won this competition [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4640.780000000001s)]
*  that had the stench about it [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4642.540000000001s)]
*  because it was like stigmatized. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4644.1s)]
*  You're gonna enter a competition for anti-gravity devices? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4646.02s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4648.860000000001s)]
*  Oppenheimer says, wow, you guys won this [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4650.14s)]
*  by using the name of the Institute [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4652.26s)]
*  for Advanced Study, you give the money back right now. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4654.06s)]
*  We're not gonna touch pseudoscience. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4655.66s)]
*  The guys kept the money. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4658.46s)]
*  And then the floodgates opened and Penrose entered it, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4659.86s)]
*  Wilczek entered it, everybody and their mother, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4662.66s)]
*  Martin Pearl entered this competition. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4664.98s)]
*  Lots of Nobel laureates win it. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4667.82s)]
*  This is this marriage of total bullshit [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4670.62s)]
*  and top drawer physics [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4674.38s)]
*  that the rest of us are not allowed to participate. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4676.5s)]
*  So if you want a weird model for how physics works, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4678.78s)]
*  think about diplomatic immunity, but in science. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4682.06s)]
*  You've got this group of people at the top [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4685.620000000001s)]
*  who are allowed to engage in quackery. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4687.860000000001s)]
*  They can hang out at Esselen and smoke dope and take LSD [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4690.14s)]
*  and go into sensory deprivation tanks like Feynman. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4693.22s)]
*  They can pal around with rich people [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4699.3s)]
*  who are talking about anti-gravity, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4701.780000000001s)]
*  but the rest of us have to stay in our lane. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4704.5s)]
*  Well, that ends now. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4708.18s)]
*  Now that I've been contacted by people saying, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4709.86s)]
*  Eric, Sam Harris and I were both contacted [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4712.139999999999s)]
*  saying that there's a disclosure planned [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4715.66s)]
*  and there's big updates and we need you to communicate [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4718.38s)]
*  this news to the world. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4723.7s)]
*  There's disclosure about a specific technology. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4724.94s)]
*  About something, I mean, more or less the way this works. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4728.259999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter who you talk to. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4732.099999999999s)]
*  Something is huge, I can't talk to you about it [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4734.46s)]
*  because you don't have clearance, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4736.299999999999s)]
*  but we're gonna fly out to Colorado Springs [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4737.9s)]
*  and we're gonna show you some stuff [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4740.74s)]
*  and you're never gonna be the same. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4742.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4744.379999999999s)]
*  Like, okay, I'm on standby. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4745.5s)]
*  My process, Joe, is that I'm very open-minded, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4749.94s)]
*  but I have a very strong filter before I'll say, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4753.0199999999995s)]
*  yeah, that's true, that's real. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4755.339999999999s)]
*  That freaks people out. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4757.5s)]
*  Why are you even talking to these people? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4758.7s)]
*  Well, because I know the history and you don't. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4760.099999999999s)]
*  So I was open to this, Sam was open to this, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4764.0199999999995s)]
*  and it's Lucy and the football every goddamn week. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4768.14s)]
*  When am I headed out to Colorado? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4771.78s)]
*  You're gonna be met by a car and you're gonna be blindfolded [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4774.06s)]
*  and you won't know where you are, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4776.74s)]
*  like, blah, blah, blah, okay. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4777.98s)]
*  This week, next week, the week after, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4780.46s)]
*  oh no, something's come up on the hill. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4782.18s)]
*  Things are getting crazy. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4783.98s)]
*  We're gonna be talking to some very big people. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4785.58s)]
*  I can't talk to you right yet. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4787.14s)]
*  So that's been my weird life now, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4789.0199999999995s)]
*  a part of it for like three years, I don't know how long. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4792.3s)]
*  For three years they've been telling you [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4794.5s)]
*  that they're gonna release this. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4795.98s)]
*  And it's always pushed out, right? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4798.26s)]
*  So like, it's a manana program, okay? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4800.18s)]
*  It's always manana. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4805.02s)]
*  And I'm not falling for it, but I'm telling you now [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4807.02s)]
*  that I have information. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4809.9800000000005s)]
*  I can't tell you everything I know. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4813.5s)]
*  I wish I could, but I'm a team player [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4815.34s)]
*  and if somebody says something in confidence, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4817.42s)]
*  I'm not gonna reveal it on the Jo Rogan Experience. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4819.46s)]
*  But there's some things I can say [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4824.66s)]
*  that nobody else can say, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4826.06s)]
*  which is I had a very weird reaction to this. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4827.26s)]
*  I think Sam was initially interested [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4829.54s)]
*  and then they manana'd him three times [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4831.26s)]
*  and he said, I'm out. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4833.700000000001s)]
*  Doesn't talk about it. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4835.34s)]
*  I went a different route. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4837.580000000001s)]
*  I said, okay, you guys keep saying all this stuff is real. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4838.9800000000005s)]
*  You keep saying you've got high quality data [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4841.38s)]
*  that you can't show anybody because it's all stove piped. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4843.580000000001s)]
*  You hear this word over and over, stove piped, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4846.22s)]
*  meaning that each little group is isolated. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4847.900000000001s)]
*  Like Bob Lazar says, I was only allowed [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4851.18s)]
*  to see this little thing. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4853.580000000001s)]
*  So I say, okay, am I right that you're telling me [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4856.700000000001s)]
*  that these things are real? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4859.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4861.06s)]
*  And then they say, and that nobody could do this [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4862.02s)]
*  that we know of? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4865.18s)]
*  I said, that's right, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4866.14s)]
*  because they seem to defy the laws of physics. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4866.9800000000005s)]
*  You hear this phrase over and over again, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4869.620000000001s)]
*  defy the laws of physics. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4870.740000000001s)]
*  I say, great, I need to talk to somebody who speaks physics. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4872.780000000001s)]
*  How do you know they defy physical law? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4876.38s)]
*  We can see that they do. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4879.54s)]
*  It's like, okay, if they defy physical law, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4880.700000000001s)]
*  then there should be a physicist to tell me [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4884.46s)]
*  that they defy physical law. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4886.74s)]
*  Who's seen the data? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4888.0599999999995s)]
*  Maybe he can't release it to me or she, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4889.0599999999995s)]
*  but tell me somebody who speaks tensor analysis. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4892.14s)]
*  Tell me somebody who knows what the Dirac equation is. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4896.5s)]
*  Like a pretty low bar for a physicist. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4898.9s)]
*  There is no one. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4902.14s)]
*  And I don't quite mean no one, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4904.38s)]
*  but do you know who Eric W. Davis is? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4906.78s)]
*  No. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4909.0599999999995s)]
*  You ever heard of the Wilson memo? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4910.26s)]
*  No. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4911.62s)]
*  Okay, there's something called the Wilson memo [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4913.22s)]
*  where there's a physicist who meets a general or an admiral, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4915.18s)]
*  and the general or the admiral is trying to figure out, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4919.06s)]
*  I think this is at EG&G, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4921.34s)]
*  why is there some program that I'm not allowed to know about? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4924.54s)]
*  I have the highest clearances, I have a need to know. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4927.34s)]
*  Like, sorry, we can't tell you. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4929.9800000000005s)]
*  He's talking to somebody named Eric W. Davis. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4932.46s)]
*  Eric W. Davis, so far as I can find, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4936.14s)]
*  is the only person other than maybe Hal Puthoff, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4940.94s)]
*  who I've been able to talk to, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4944.94s)]
*  who speaks anything of these languages. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4946.219999999999s)]
*  This is not a particularly famous physicist. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4949.82s)]
*  Hal Puthoff is an electrical engineer, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4953.219999999999s)]
*  I think, PhD in electrical engineering. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4955.179999999999s)]
*  Eric W. Davis says to me, I said, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4958.7s)]
*  is there nobody out here who speaks physics? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4960.86s)]
*  This doesn't make any sense. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4963.219999999999s)]
*  And he says, well, you, Hal, and I [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4965.099999999999s)]
*  are the three most technical people on this. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4966.58s)]
*  Joe, I'm not even on this. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4970.02s)]
*  So you know as much about it as anyone, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4973.22s)]
*  and you're not even involved, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4976.42s)]
*  and there's only two other people [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4977.700000000001s)]
*  that know the science behind this? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4978.740000000001s)]
*  And like one of them is into remote viewing, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4980.620000000001s)]
*  and was a Scientologist. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4985.42s)]
*  So, I'm just, imagine that you take your wife [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4989.38s)]
*  to the symphony, okay, and you're gonna see Beethoven's [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4993.9800000000005s)]
*  seventh, and you look at the string section, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4995.9400000000005s)]
*  brass section's in place, and the percussion is there, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=4998.94s)]
*  and you look at the string section, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5002.62s)]
*  and it's a bunch of certified public accountants. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5003.7s)]
*  Where are the violins? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5008.339999999999s)]
*  Where are the violas? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5009.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, oh no, actually we have reporters for the AP, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5011.139999999999s)]
*  they're stringers, that's not the same thing. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5014.58s)]
*  We have string theorists, that's not the same thing. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5016.46s)]
*  I'm looking for, this is simple. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5018.78s)]
*  I've been on this for three years, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5021.9s)]
*  and I can't find anybody who speaks this language, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5023.219999999999s)]
*  which now that is a huge clue. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5025.78s)]
*  Imagine that you say that we've lost control [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5029.099999999999s)]
*  of our airspace, we're being menaced, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5031.139999999999s)]
*  threats to civilian aviation, military aviation, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5035.0199999999995s)]
*  they're seeing these things every day, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5037.62s)]
*  they defy the physical laws, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5038.82s)]
*  and there are no physicists anywhere to be found. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5040.139999999999s)]
*  That smells like BS, or it smells like a pathological level [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5042.82s)]
*  of bureaucratic incompetence. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5048.299999999999s)]
*  And Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gilderand, if you're out there, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5050.74s)]
*  can you please find out why there are no [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5054.740000000001s)]
*  technically competent people on an area [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5058.62s)]
*  of national security, and please don't mumble [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5062.02s)]
*  the word stovepipe, or need to know, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5063.860000000001s)]
*  or sources and methods. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5066.5s)]
*  I mean, we had a Manhattan Project, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5068.3s)]
*  we staffed it with physicists, you have a physics problem. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5070.14s)]
*  If these things are here, Joe, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5073.9400000000005s)]
*  they are here from so far out of town, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5076.42s)]
*  or they are co-mingling with us on Earth, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5078.38s)]
*  I can't tell you which. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5080.860000000001s)]
*  There are some reports that these things come screaming in [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5083.14s)]
*  from behind our satellites that are trained at Earth [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5086.14s)]
*  along non-ballistic trajectories. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5089.34s)]
*  I have no idea how to say this. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5091.22s)]
*  I'm talking all the time to Avi Loeb [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5093.3s)]
*  with the Galileo Project, trying to help him out. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5096.38s)]
*  He needs funding, and he needs some ability to, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5098.860000000001s)]
*  just if the government won't play ball, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5102.34s)]
*  he's gonna put out his own sensors in places [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5103.780000000001s)]
*  like Catalina Island, blanket the world, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5105.58s)]
*  and he'll be able to say, we're seeing these things, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5107.820000000001s)]
*  or we're not seeing these things. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5110.26s)]
*  But right now, we have a puzzle [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5113.1s)]
*  that our government won't release information [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5114.860000000001s)]
*  to its own scientific community. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5117.18s)]
*  And it reminds me of, you probably know Airplane, the movie. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5119.38s)]
*  Yeah, I speak Jive. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5122.38s)]
*  Well, there's this point where they're trying [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5123.700000000001s)]
*  to land this airplane with these people who aren't pilots. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5125.5s)]
*  He says, turn on the landing strip lights. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5128.780000000001s)]
*  And it was Lloyd Bridges or somebody who says, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5132.14s)]
*  no, that's just what they'll be expecting. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5134.06s)]
*  Like he's trying to sabotage the people [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5137.02s)]
*  who are trying to land the plane. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5138.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5139.740000000001s)]
*  I'm sure there are scientists. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5140.58s)]
*  Do you think this is because there's a level of secrecy [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5142.74s)]
*  that's attached to this technology, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5146.54s)]
*  and they've compartmentalized themselves to death, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5148.38s)]
*  and they've gotten themselves to a point [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5150.78s)]
*  where they don't know how to proceed further [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5152.1s)]
*  because they're preventing people from sharing information, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5155.58s)]
*  which is one of the most important things about science, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5158.98s)]
*  is that scientists get to share information [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5161.54s)]
*  and all work together to try to figure out [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5165.54s)]
*  what the problem is. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5167.74s)]
*  Is that reasonable? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5168.94s)]
*  Well, here comes the decision trees. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5171.7s)]
*  I wish I could say, yeah, that's what I think it is. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5173.46s)]
*  Right, but it might not be. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5175.58s)]
*  So one possibility is, let's be honest, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5176.54s)]
*  if you are faking UFOs, the last people you want [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5180.139999999999s)]
*  are the world's most brilliant physicists. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5185.0199999999995s)]
*  You give them the data, they're gonna say, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5187.9s)]
*  oh, look, I see what you did. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5189.66s)]
*  You put a couple of flashlights with lasers into the sky [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5192.099999999999s)]
*  and you can move them really quickly by the angle, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5195.74s)]
*  and that creates the illusion [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5197.54s)]
*  that something is zipping through the world. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5198.66s)]
*  Right, if you are faking UFOs, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5200.78s)]
*  if you're faking a UFOgasm, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5203.7s)]
*  the last thing you want is theoretical physicists [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5205.78s)]
*  on the case. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5208.34s)]
*  So that would be one reason to clear them out. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5209.18s)]
*  Another reason would be bureaucracy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5210.94s)]
*  You've got these rival groups, they're all starved for money. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5213.78s)]
*  Nobody wants to invite somebody smarter than they are. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5216.62s)]
*  So the problem with a B-level and C-level players [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5218.82s)]
*  is that they're looking for DNF players [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5221.34s)]
*  so that they're not threatened. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5223.0199999999995s)]
*  That's another possibility. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5224.3s)]
*  A different possibility is that we do have [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5226.7s)]
*  a Manhattan Project, and we don't know about it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5228.9s)]
*  So for example, we have a Manhattan Project [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5232.5s)]
*  for decoding cryptographic messages, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5234.42s)]
*  and it's called the National Security Agency, NSA. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5237.3s)]
*  And it used to be called No Such Agency [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5241.0199999999995s)]
*  because we wanted to deny its existence, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5242.54s)]
*  but now we know it's got a giant building. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5244.54s)]
*  How do you know that it exists if nobody told you? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5247.179999999999s)]
*  Well, you'd look at the number theory PhDs, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5249.54s)]
*  and people who specialize in things like elliptic curves, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5254.46s)]
*  and you would notice that a giant number of them [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5257.3s)]
*  after their PhDs disappear. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5259.22s)]
*  And you'd track to see, well, where do those people live? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5262.3s)]
*  Where do those names live? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5264.3s)]
*  Oh, they live in Virginia. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5265.26s)]
*  Okay, so you'd start to get an idea. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5266.82s)]
*  Now, in the case of UFOs, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5270.02s)]
*  if there was an antigravity project, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5273.1s)]
*  which it's painful for me to even say these words, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5275.3s)]
*  really what it would be is a post-Einsteinian physics project. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5279.06s)]
*  If you had a post-Einsteinian physics project, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5283.46s)]
*  you would want three subspecialties for sure. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5286.22s)]
*  That would be differential geometry, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5290.06s)]
*  which is the basis for originally general relativity. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5291.9s)]
*  In 1976, 75, two guys named Sien Yang and Jim Simons, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5299.38s)]
*  who Jim Simons becomes the world's greatest hedge fund manager, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5305.94s)]
*  figure out that quantum field theory [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5309.82s)]
*  is also based on geometry, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5313.7s)]
*  but it's a different version of differential geometry. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5316.179999999999s)]
*  So that's one specialty that you would want. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5318.74s)]
*  Second specialty that you would want [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5321.259999999999s)]
*  would be particle theory or high energy physics, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5323.46s)]
*  however you wanna say it. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5326.94s)]
*  The third specialty you'd want is general relativity. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5328.66s)]
*  So if you wanted to detect [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5332.099999999999s)]
*  whether we had a secret Manhattan project, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5333.7s)]
*  but it wasn't identifiable by a building [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5335.98s)]
*  because we didn't announce its existence, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5340.98s)]
*  you'd say, is there anything [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5342.66s)]
*  that eats those three specialties [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5344.379999999999s)]
*  unless you believe that there's a secret university system? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5346.379999999999s)]
*  Because we have lists of everybody who gets produced [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5348.66s)]
*  with a PhD in these fields. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5350.62s)]
*  If that was the case, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5353.7s)]
*  the two places that you would have a secret place [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5356.0599999999995s)]
*  would be Austin, which is the successor [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5359.339999999999s)]
*  to the Institute for Field Physics [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5363.419999999999s)]
*  at the University of Texas Austin Gravitational Group, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5364.86s)]
*  which is our general relativistic group, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5368.7s)]
*  which has had John Archibald Wheeler, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5370.82s)]
*  Steven Weinberg, Bryce DeWitt. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5373.38s)]
*  This is a powerhouse of a place [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5376.58s)]
*  that you happen to live in, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5378.42s)]
*  and you should have these people [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5379.42s)]
*  who are the successors to these people on [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5380.46s)]
*  because most of these people have died. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5382.46s)]
*  But the more spectacular place [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5385.94s)]
*  would be Sataka, Long Island. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5388.259999999999s)]
*  The State University of New York at Stony Brook [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5390.02s)]
*  has an astounding collection of monster minds, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5397.540000000001s)]
*  and it's not highly regarded as a university. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5403.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's strong, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5407.34s)]
*  but you would have no idea how strong this place is. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5409.740000000001s)]
*  It's got multiple fields, medalists. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5413.14s)]
*  It's got an institute called the, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5416.3s)]
*  what is it, the Simon Center for Geometry and Physics. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5418.86s)]
*  C.N. Yang, who's arguably [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5423.219999999999s)]
*  the greatest living theoretical physicist, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5425.38s)]
*  is at this university. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5429.54s)]
*  He's 101 years old, so he's pretty much on his way out, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5430.54s)]
*  but this is where he called home. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5433.82s)]
*  And it's not advertised as the powerhouse that it is. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5437.0599999999995s)]
*  So shout out to the State University of New York [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5442.259999999999s)]
*  at Stony Brook. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5444.299999999999s)]
*  If I was gonna locate a Manhattan project in plain sight, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5445.299999999999s)]
*  and get US News and World to report this [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5449.26s)]
*  as a minor player in research, that's where I'd go. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5450.7s)]
*  But more importantly, and this is the really weird thing, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5456.66s)]
*  and again, I don't wanna spread this as a rumor, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5460.0199999999995s)]
*  but I am saying, if you wanted to imagine [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5462.7s)]
*  that the government wasn't incompetent, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5466.34s)]
*  and we actually had great people on this project, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5468.46s)]
*  my friend and advisor who's now died, Isadore Singer, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5471.98s)]
*  once said to me, he said, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5477.0599999999995s)]
*  the world's greatest mathematics and physics department [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5479.0199999999995s)]
*  is Renaissance technologies. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5481.86s)]
*  I said, what? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5484.459999999999s)]
*  Didn't make any sense to me. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5486.459999999999s)]
*  It's great people, but it's a hedge fund. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5488.82s)]
*  Okay, so you've got this weird thing [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5492.259999999999s)]
*  where you've got three basic institutions [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5493.7s)]
*  that are very closely intertwined. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5498.139999999999s)]
*  You've got Brookhaven National Laboratory. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5500.339999999999s)]
*  You've got State University of New York at Stony Brook, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5503.38s)]
*  a mid-level university with an out-of-this-world [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5506.38s)]
*  math and physics program. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5509.58s)]
*  And you've got a hedge fund that makes more money [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5512.18s)]
*  than anybody can possibly imagine. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5514.7s)]
*  Like, there used to be four fortunes in hedge funds [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5517.900000000001s)]
*  that didn't make any sense. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5522.900000000001s)]
*  One was D.E. Shaw, one was Bernie Madoff, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5525.74s)]
*  one was Jeff Epstein, and one was Renaissance Technologies. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5529.66s)]
*  And I guessed that Bernie Madoff had a legitimate business [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5537.259999999999s)]
*  and an illegitimate business, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5542.66s)]
*  and he was front-running the legitimate business [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5543.82s)]
*  with his illegitimate business, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5546.0599999999995s)]
*  so he was effectively stealing from his own clients [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5547.78s)]
*  in two separate, in one division. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5550.259999999999s)]
*  One was the theft, one was the dupes. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5552.7s)]
*  I got that wrong, he was just running a Ponzi scheme, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5555.74s)]
*  so shame on me. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5557.98s)]
*  But I was giving talks about, you know, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5559.98s)]
*  there's BlackRock and Blackstone as investment groups, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5562.62s)]
*  and I was going around in the early 2000s [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5566.139999999999s)]
*  talking about Black Arts Capital, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5568.58s)]
*  and we'd give talks on Black Arts Capital. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5570.459999999999s)]
*  We'd tell you what we're doing, but we'd have to kill you. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5572.9s)]
*  And that was a reference to Madoff and Epstein, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5575.099999999999s)]
*  because Epstein's fortune made no sense, right? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5578.259999999999s)]
*  Renaissance has existed in its medallion fund for decades, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5583.3s)]
*  has turned into performance never seen [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5589.42s)]
*  by anything else remotely, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5591.62s)]
*  effectively just a money printing machine. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5592.860000000001s)]
*  No one knows how it works. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5595.820000000001s)]
*  I've met with Jim Simon's one-on-one for three hours, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5599.02s)]
*  and because his wife is an economist, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5602.66s)]
*  my wife is an economist, I'm a differential geometer, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5604.34s)]
*  he's a differential geometer, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5606.38s)]
*  I gave him this entire theory [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5608.7s)]
*  that all of modern neoclassical economics [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5610.46s)]
*  is actually differential geometric. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5613.58s)]
*  And three hours later, he's been chain smoking, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5616.74s)]
*  he smokes like a chimney, never wears socks, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5619.18s)]
*  very eccentric guy, brilliant as the day is long, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5621.18s)]
*  still alive, go get him for a guest. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5623.66s)]
*  He says, well, Eric, that's brilliant, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5629.54s)]
*  if you knew what we were actually doing, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5631.26s)]
*  you'd be very disappointed. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5632.66s)]
*  He said, I never thought of this. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5634.06s)]
*  Now, a little while later, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5637.82s)]
*  I don't know if you know who Brian Keating is, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5638.94s)]
*  he's a professor at UCSD, he's an experimentalist. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5640.46s)]
*  Jim is basically his uncle, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5644.74s)]
*  and he calls me out to Santa Barbara, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5646.62s)]
*  and Jim is having dinner at his brother's house. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5649.58s)]
*  And what you guys don't know about Jim Simon's [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5654.379999999999s)]
*  is that with a guy named S.S. Churn, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5658.58s)]
*  he came up with something called [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5661.339999999999s)]
*  the Churn-Simon's Function, or Churn-Simon's Functional, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5662.62s)]
*  where if you differentiate this thing, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5666.5s)]
*  the way you differentiate the Einstein-Hilbert Functional, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5669.58s)]
*  you get an equation that looks very similar [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5672.0599999999995s)]
*  to the Einstein field equation for gravity, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5674.58s)]
*  only it looks a lot more like particle theory. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5677.26s)]
*  So I told Jim, I said, I don't know if you know this, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5681.179999999999s)]
*  or you don't know this, but I think you're sitting on top [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5684.98s)]
*  of a piece of the puzzle [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5688.94s)]
*  that supersedes general relativity. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5690.42s)]
*  And on the spot, he asked me whether I wanted to come out [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5692.94s)]
*  to the State University of New York at Stony Brook [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5695.179999999999s)]
*  for a year to work on this. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5698.18s)]
*  We had like a very technical conversation. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5702.740000000001s)]
*  Jim Simon's is potentially, I mean, beyond brilliant, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5705.1s)]
*  but also has a claim on a part of what I believe [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5710.14s)]
*  is going to supersede general relativity [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5713.9800000000005s)]
*  by imitating the Einstein-Hilbert action [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5716.740000000001s)]
*  from which the Einstein field equations are derived. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5720.42s)]
*  This thing generates something [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5722.740000000001s)]
*  which you would call the Churn-Simon's equation. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5724.46s)]
*  Ed Witten gets the Fields Medal for quantizing [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5728.06s)]
*  this thing that looks like gravity, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5731.06s)]
*  but is actually sort of particle theoretic. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5733.06s)]
*  And I can't get into it [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5735.9400000000005s)]
*  because we don't have the common language to do it. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5737.22s)]
*  This is huge stuff. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5742.42s)]
*  What's going on at Stony Brook? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5744.740000000001s)]
*  What has happened is Stony Brook is ground zero [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5746.5s)]
*  for the explosion in mathematical physics [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5749.58s)]
*  that came through something called the Wu Yang Dictionary, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5751.9400000000005s)]
*  where suddenly the quantum became as geometric [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5754.98s)]
*  as general relativity. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5757.94s)]
*  Then it got more geometric [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5759.419999999999s)]
*  through something called geometric quantization. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5760.459999999999s)]
*  Then it got more geometric [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5762.419999999999s)]
*  through something called Geometric Quantum Field Theory, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5763.5s)]
*  or Topological Quantum Field Theory, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5766.179999999999s)]
*  or Conformal Quantum Field Theory. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5767.7s)]
*  I don't know whether Sotoket is the locus. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5770.219999999999s)]
*  Can you bring up the iconic wall, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5775.86s)]
*  picture of the iconic wall? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5778.94s)]
*  This is like a religious artifact. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5780.0599999999995s)]
*  Let me pee. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5781.98s)]
*  Hold this right here. Sure. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5783.379999999999s)]
*  Let's hold right here with this. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5784.42s)]
*  We'll bring that up. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5786.18s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5787.1s)]
*  We're back. We're up. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5788.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5790.3s)]
*  So Jamie, what was this thing that you were pulling up? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5791.14s)]
*  We have a picture here of the iconic wall at Stony Brook. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5795.14s)]
*  It's a little hard to see in the picture, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5799.54s)]
*  so that is what is on it. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5801.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5803.54s)]
*  So this is like, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5804.38s)]
*  imagine ancient Egyptian ruins, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5805.9800000000005s)]
*  and like the most crazy, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5809.1s)]
*  first of all, I would correct this thing [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5812.38s)]
*  in a million different ways, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5815.02s)]
*  but you see the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5815.860000000001s)]
*  equation for the curvature tensor, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5819.820000000001s)]
*  Maxwell's equations in geometric form, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5821.1s)]
*  written out in differential form, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5823.46s)]
*  equations for string theory. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5826.34s)]
*  This thing, E8, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5828.5s)]
*  the 248 largest simple Lie group in the world, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5831.38s)]
*  this is like almost a religious pilgrimage site. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5835.38s)]
*  What's wrong with that that you would correct? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5840.22s)]
*  You want to put it up? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5842.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5843.18s)]
*  DA star of FA at the bottom of the ellipse equals zero [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5849.3s)]
*  is only the vacuum equations. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5852.860000000001s)]
*  I would put in a term called J. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5854.46s)]
*  Above that, you see Dim-Kur-D. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5861.66s)]
*  This is the Atiyah-Singer, remember Isidore-Singer. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5864.02s)]
*  That thing should be expanded [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5867.820000000001s)]
*  to something called the Atiyah-Petodi-Singer Index Theorem. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5869.740000000001s)]
*  That's the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5874.14s)]
*  for manifolds with boundary. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5875.9400000000005s)]
*  Above that, you see the Dirac equation, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5877.66s)]
*  I D slash minus M times psi equals zero. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5880.62s)]
*  Actually, if I'm correct, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5885.700000000001s)]
*  it should be a hybrid between the Rurida-Schwinger [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5887.14s)]
*  and the Dirac equations based on a three complex [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5889.860000000001s)]
*  tensored with a spinner. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5892.54s)]
*  Above that, you have a non-relativistic equation, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5894.900000000001s)]
*  which is the Schrodinger equation, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5897.14s)]
*  because there's only one derivative in terms of T, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5898.900000000001s)]
*  which is different in terms of space. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5901.42s)]
*  So you can't treat space and time asymmetrically. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5903.74s)]
*  Above that, you have the Einstein field equations, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5905.9800000000005s)]
*  R mu nu minus one half R times G mu nu. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5909.34s)]
*  There should be a cosmological constant in there, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5911.3s)]
*  which is missing. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5913.9800000000005s)]
*  To the right, you have the E8 diagram, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5918.1s)]
*  should be the Titz-Freudenthal Magic Square. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5920.74s)]
*  So I don't know whether this is like a Straussian [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5923.14s)]
*  communication in the sense that if you're smart enough, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5924.9s)]
*  you should know that there are tons of errors, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5927.9800000000005s)]
*  limitations, and bad choices. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5930.38s)]
*  I would not write out the Maxwellts above that. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5933.18s)]
*  You've got these Nobla B, Nobla E equals zero. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5936.26s)]
*  What's the other possibility in terms of these errors? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5939.46s)]
*  Somebody hired somebody to do something impressionistic [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5942.02s)]
*  and it got too far in the process, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5945.18s)]
*  carving Indiana limestone before they figured out [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5946.82s)]
*  that you should really do this better. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5949.06s)]
*  But this is gorgeous, and it's the only place in the world, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5951.06s)]
*  this is my language, Joe. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5955.78s)]
*  If you ask what language does Eric speak [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5957.74s)]
*  and why does he act weird when he comes on my show, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5960.5s)]
*  this is my native language. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5962.46s)]
*  Beautiful piece. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5965.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, beyond. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5966.66s)]
*  It's really wild. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5968.5s)]
*  And it costs a fortune, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5969.5s)]
*  and this is Jim Simon's money at work. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5971.299999999999s)]
*  You need to know, Jim. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5976.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5978.54s)]
*  So my question is, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5984.66s)]
*  do we have a project? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5988.7s)]
*  If we're not doing something in Sao Tucket, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5990.9s)]
*  or we're not doing something [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5992.339999999999s)]
*  at the University of Texas at Austin, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5993.299999999999s)]
*  I'm worried we're not doing something anywhere. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5994.98s)]
*  I went to the Institute for Advanced Study [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5997.139999999999s)]
*  to visit friend acquaintance, Neema Arkani Hamed, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=5999.46s)]
*  who I think very, very highly of. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6003.179999999999s)]
*  He said some pretty wild things, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6006.5s)]
*  should be on the show. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6009.58s)]
*  He's the most bizarre thing [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6010.54s)]
*  in that he's an unbelievable salesman showman [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6013.139999999999s)]
*  who's pathologically honest in a weird way. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6015.259999999999s)]
*  So that's very unusual characteristics. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6018.5s)]
*  He made the point, he said, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6021.66s)]
*  the Casimir effect is an example of negative energy, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6023.5s)]
*  negative mass energy, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6026.42s)]
*  where you take two plates that are so close together [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6028.94s)]
*  that quantum waves, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6031.62s)]
*  many of the frequencies can't fit between these two plates. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6033.86s)]
*  And so the pressure outside of them [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6037.38s)]
*  is not counterbalanced by pressure between them, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6039.3s)]
*  so they get forced together when they're very, very close. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6041.3s)]
*  And his point is, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6044.02s)]
*  that's an example of actual negative mass, negative energy, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6044.86s)]
*  where we pretend that that's not true. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6048.3s)]
*  He says, geckos actually use this when they climb up a wall, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6050.22s)]
*  they use the Casimir effect. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6053.3s)]
*  So it's real. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6055.42s)]
*  Now the question, can you harness it? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6056.42s)]
*  This is always that, you know, you've got UFOs, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6058.34s)]
*  people who try to think about how you could get physics [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6060.3s)]
*  to do these things, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6062.9400000000005s)]
*  focus on the Casimir effect, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6064.740000000001s)]
*  or they'll focus on negative energy solutions. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6066.860000000001s)]
*  Now, if you look at that 1957 conference [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6070.42s)]
*  at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6072.9800000000005s)]
*  one of the most eminent mathematician physicists, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6075.58s)]
*  a guy who was first ranked at Cambridge, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6078.06s)]
*  was a guy named Herman Bondy, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6079.5s)]
*  an Austrian, I think, mathematician. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6081.38s)]
*  And his paper is about negative mass in general relativity. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6083.9400000000005s)]
*  Now, I don't know if you've ever heard of this stuff. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6089.46s)]
*  No. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6092.02s)]
*  If you have two masses in general, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6093.34s)]
*  they always attract each other gravitationally. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6095.14s)]
*  But what if somehow you had a different kind of mass [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6098.22s)]
*  that was negative, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6100.900000000001s)]
*  just like you could have negative and positive charges? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6101.740000000001s)]
*  Well, weirdly, you change two things. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6104.900000000001s)]
*  You change the force law, F equals ma, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6107.42s)]
*  and you change the gravitational law, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6110.22s)]
*  g, you know, F equals g, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6112.26s)]
*  m, first mass times second mass over r squared. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6115.02s)]
*  So when you change both of those, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6118.54s)]
*  oddly, the negative mass is still attracted [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6120.62s)]
*  just the same way to the positive mass, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6123.58s)]
*  as if there was no difference. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6125.14s)]
*  But the positive mass is always repelled. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6126.58s)]
*  So you get this weird solution [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6129.34s)]
*  where the negative mass chases the positive mass, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6131.22s)]
*  and they go off to like, you know, unbounded acceleration. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6134.7s)]
*  So Bondi was thinking about why is it [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6139.26s)]
*  that we've got these artificial conditions [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6142.74s)]
*  in general relativity, which we impose by hand. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6144.9s)]
*  They're not the same beautiful marble [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6147.139999999999s)]
*  that Einstein used for his field equations, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6149.7s)]
*  but we throw some extra crappy stuff in [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6151.86s)]
*  called positivity conditions [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6154.78s)]
*  to stop general relativity from giving us madness. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6156.7s)]
*  So Bondi started asking the question, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6160.74s)]
*  maybe we shouldn't. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6163.34s)]
*  Maybe what you think of as madness has meaning. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6165.14s)]
*  And this is why this conference, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6169.7s)]
*  which is a confluence of the two families, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6173.34s)]
*  the Wittons and the Dewitts, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6175.1s)]
*  with Feynman and Wheeler [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6176.82s)]
*  and all of these unbelievable characters in attendance, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6178.06s)]
*  is this pivotal, strange experience, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6181.78s)]
*  is that people are smoking the ganja [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6184.02s)]
*  on extending general relativity to places [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6187.62s)]
*  that it's never been extended. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6189.9400000000005s)]
*  And the high-brow version of this doesn't work, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6191.54s)]
*  and the low-brow version of this [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6194.82s)]
*  doesn't work so far as we know. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6196.18s)]
*  The low-brow version is called pseudo-scientific [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6197.78s)]
*  anti-gravity, gravity shielding, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6200.86s)]
*  electro-gravitics, gravitated dynamics. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6203.9s)]
*  The high-brow version of this is called quantum gravity, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6207.74s)]
*  and all the most respectable people are in it, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6211.3s)]
*  and it doesn't work, and you can't say, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6213.18s)]
*  why are we doing this if it doesn't work? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6215.46s)]
*  Why can't I say Ed Witton's great, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6218.0199999999995s)]
*  but he made a terrible blunder. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6221.820000000001s)]
*  David Gross and Ed Witton should be [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6223.38s)]
*  in front of the community explaining, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6226.9800000000005s)]
*  why did you take all the smartest people, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6228.780000000001s)]
*  all the resources, all the attention? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6230.62s)]
*  Michio Kaku, get Michio Kaku in here with me. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6233.9800000000005s)]
*  Michio Kaku is out of control. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6238.14s)]
*  Sean Carroll is covering up for this as well. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6242.02s)]
*  In what way? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6244.860000000001s)]
*  They are too kind. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6246.34s)]
*  Brian Greene, like I had this interchange [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6248.46s)]
*  between Brian Greene where I said, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6250.38s)]
*  we're not being honest about the failure of string theory. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6254.3s)]
*  Brian's like, oh, well, maybe we were a little bit exuberant. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6259.86s)]
*  I blurt out Institute for Arts and Ideas, I blurt out. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6262.46s)]
*  That's like saying, my lie was irrational exuberance. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6267.66s)]
*  No, you put a lot of people's careers in the shredder [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6272.900000000001s)]
*  in order to have this quantum gravity experiment, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6276.82s)]
*  which is like the people bowing and praying [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6279.9s)]
*  to this thing that doesn't work. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6282.86s)]
*  The dog doesn't hunt and anybody who questions it [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6285.94s)]
*  is a crackpot, I'm done with this Joe. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6288.139999999999s)]
*  You wanna come at me and say, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6292.42s)]
*  Eric doesn't know what he's talking about? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6294.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm debating physicists, I'll debate anybody [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6295.38s)]
*  with the possible assumption of Ed Witton, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6297.58s)]
*  who still scares me, but I'll probably debate him too. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6299.299999999999s)]
*  In open forum, we have got to purge [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6302.74s)]
*  the physics community of its quackery [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6306.46s)]
*  and the quackery is coming from [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6309.26s)]
*  the high prestige version of this. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6310.54s)]
*  The high prestige version of anti-gravity [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6312.66s)]
*  is called quantum gravity and it just doesn't work. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6314.58s)]
*  So to get back to the UFOs, why is this stuff important? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6318.3s)]
*  One, I don't know, four years, five years ago [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6325.3s)]
*  when I was doing this riff on the twin nuclei problem, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6329.06s)]
*  I said, we've gotta get off this planet. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6332.1s)]
*  I said, we now become gods, but for the wisdom [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6334.26s)]
*  and I just threw it off and you said, focus on that, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6336.42s)]
*  that's a great saying, turned out to work. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6338.26s)]
*  That came true. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6342.42s)]
*  The COVID in your lungs probably came out [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6344.1s)]
*  of the Wuhan Institute of Virology [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6346.02s)]
*  and we're lying about it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6347.66s)]
*  That is engineering the nucleus of the cell, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6350.26s)]
*  the nucleic acids that we found [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6353.1s)]
*  the structure of in their function. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6354.780000000001s)]
*  Right now, we are screwing around with Vladimir Putin [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6357.22s)]
*  with nukes pretending that the sacred borders of Ukraine, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6360.26s)]
*  which have been fluctuating for centuries, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6363.38s)]
*  are somehow sacrosanct. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6366.58s)]
*  And yes, it's terrible that he's invaded [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6368.78s)]
*  and I do think that the border shouldn't move, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6372.54s)]
*  but we really shouldn't have been antagonizing Russia [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6374.5s)]
*  by pretending that there's no concept [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6378.22s)]
*  of a sphere of influence because I'll tell you, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6379.9s)]
*  when somebody puts nukes on our border with Mexico [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6381.54s)]
*  in Monterey or Baja, California, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6384.58s)]
*  we're gonna be plenty upset. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6386.66s)]
*  We now need to leave and I tried to say that [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6390.86s)]
*  kind of a little bit light tongue in cheek. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6395.820000000001s)]
*  Everything's accelerated. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6397.9400000000005s)]
*  Think about our water having broken in the last three years. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6399.22s)]
*  This is our womb. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6403.58s)]
*  It's time to go. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6405.54s)]
*  And in order to have any hope of getting off this planet, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6407.3s)]
*  you can't leave it to Elon and chemical rockets. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6410.46s)]
*  Can you imagine that Elon and I do not meet ever? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6413.5s)]
*  It's like we know a million people in common. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6417.58s)]
*  He knows that I'm focused on getting off this planet. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6419.38s)]
*  He's got a chemical rocket company. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6423.02s)]
*  He's exactly right about almost everything that he's saying [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6424.58s)]
*  up until he gets to the moon and Mars and like, who cares? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6427.46s)]
*  You're not gonna terraform the moon and Mars [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6430.3s)]
*  in the next three years or 30. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6432.98s)]
*  The only way to really get off this planet [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6436.46s)]
*  is to leave the solar system [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6438.26s)]
*  because those are the only two rocks [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6439.54s)]
*  that are even halfway viable. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6441.1s)]
*  And if you think about how far away everything is, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6443.34s)]
*  we've got this thing that I call the Einstein mote. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6445.98s)]
*  The nearest star, if we took a human traveling [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6449.1s)]
*  at the top speed a human has ever gone at, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6451.66s)]
*  I think is 100,000 years away at that top speed. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6455.18s)]
*  So you can fantasize, but oh yeah, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6460.02s)]
*  we just come up with huge ships [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6461.860000000001s)]
*  and people have multi-generational experience. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6463.46s)]
*  All of Jewish history is 5,000 years [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6465.74s)]
*  and you're talking about 100,000 years. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6467.5s)]
*  No way you're gonna do this on a ship. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6469.62s)]
*  Imagine wars on a ship. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6471.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6472.900000000001s)]
*  And then you have this next problem, which is, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6474.06s)]
*  oh, we're gonna use time dilation. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6477.06s)]
*  No, no, we're gonna use wormholes. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6478.5s)]
*  It's like, yeah, and we're gonna bring nunchucks [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6479.900000000001s)]
*  and throwing stars [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6482.1s)]
*  and we're gonna be fucking awesome, dude. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6483.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, so it's like all of these sort of weird, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6484.82s)]
*  edgy stuff inside. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6488.46s)]
*  Here's what's really happening. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6490.98s)]
*  We do not live in space time. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6492.78s)]
*  This place is not in space time. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6494.9s)]
*  There's a saying, the map is not the territory. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6497.219999999999s)]
*  Space time is a map, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6500.299999999999s)]
*  but the territory is wherever we actually live. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6502.74s)]
*  And space time has so many limitations on it [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6505.86s)]
*  that Newton never placed. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6508.419999999999s)]
*  So the longer we stay with no advancement [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6509.74s)]
*  in the general theory of relativity, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6512.34s)]
*  the more we feel that we are imprisoned here. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6513.78s)]
*  We're not going anywhere. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6516.22s)]
*  It's all sci-fi, it's all garbage. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6517.66s)]
*  It's children talking about things that aren't true. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6521.02s)]
*  Well, bullshit. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6523.7s)]
*  Every time you fundamentally push physical theory, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6525.66s)]
*  you better figure out whether you've got a new neutron [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6528.54s)]
*  or worse or better. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6531.1s)]
*  You're gonna get a lever. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6533.06s)]
*  Now, my claim, and so everything I've said up until now [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6534.900000000001s)]
*  has been idiosyncratic research, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6538.74s)]
*  but you can check it online. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6540.54s)]
*  None of this is something you can't check. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6542.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm now gonna put on a different hat [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6545.740000000001s)]
*  when you ask me about you, Eric, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6547.26s)]
*  because people are gonna say crank, crazy, whatever. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6549.3s)]
*  I'll meet you on the field of battle. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6552.14s)]
*  Cut the crap, people. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6554.22s)]
*  I am a post-Einsteinian person. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6559.1s)]
*  I have not been in a relativistic context for years. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6561.14s)]
*  And the reason that you get to leave relativity [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6565.860000000001s)]
*  is that you recover relativity from another theory. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6567.900000000001s)]
*  If you have a theory that includes relativity, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6571.02s)]
*  you can say, okay, yeah, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6574.14s)]
*  I know how to see relativity inside the theory, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6575.18s)]
*  but I can also see other stuff beyond it. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6577.46s)]
*  And so that's where I work, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6579.740000000001s)]
*  someplace called geometric unity, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6580.860000000001s)]
*  because the geometry underneath the standard model [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6582.34s)]
*  and the geometry underneath general relativity [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6585.540000000001s)]
*  is two different geometries [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6587.34s)]
*  called Riemannian and Erismannian. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6588.620000000001s)]
*  I combined them. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6591.46s)]
*  That was the point of it. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6592.5s)]
*  In this thing, there's a very clear idea [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6594.860000000001s)]
*  about how you would go about traveling great distances. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6597.780000000001s)]
*  I found that you still have this thing [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6601.3s)]
*  from the last time I was here two years ago. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6603.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is a model of a spacetime metric. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6605.34s)]
*  And if you think about where these hair ties are [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6609.46s)]
*  on the two rulers, so this is the angle between- [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6611.9s)]
*  For people just listening, there's an adjustable ruler [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6614.42s)]
*  with a sphere or a circle, rather. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6616.7s)]
*  So two rulers coming out of a protractor. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6619.5s)]
*  And you can change the angle of the ruler. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6622.46s)]
*  So whatever I choose this to be is 90 degrees. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6624.099999999999s)]
*  If I do it like this, that's still 90 degrees, or this. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6626.82s)]
*  That's what an Einsteinian metric is. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6629.02s)]
*  This hair tie that I can move up and down [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6631.9400000000005s)]
*  is gonna be the time measurement, like a watch. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6633.64s)]
*  Did you ever see when I gave Lex my watch? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6637.38s)]
*  No. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6639.820000000001s)]
*  So you gave Lex a watch, and I started talking [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6640.660000000001s)]
*  about multiple time dimensions, so I gave him my Fitbit. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6642.42s)]
*  Anyway, if you want to go a very long distance, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6645.620000000001s)]
*  one possibility is that you do something [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6651.02s)]
*  very energetically expensive. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6653.900000000001s)]
*  But the other possibility is grow the ruler [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6655.56s)]
*  to shrink the distance. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6658.24s)]
*  If the rulers and protractors that Einstein used, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6660.179999999999s)]
*  he chose one through his equation, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6662.84s)]
*  are instead variables, and you have full access to them. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6666.34s)]
*  If I wanted to go a very long distance, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6669.76s)]
*  the first thing I'd do is grow the ruler [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6672.2s)]
*  to shrink the distance, then go the distance [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6674.0s)]
*  under that ruler, and then I'd shrink the ruler back. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6676.04s)]
*  So when you talk about things like, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6680.04s)]
*  oh, these things are behaving like nothing I've ever seen, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6681.36s)]
*  well, there are a couple things that I'm worried about [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6684.719999999999s)]
*  if these things are real. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6687.6s)]
*  One is, does somebody else know how to grow rulers [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6689.42s)]
*  and shrink rulers, and grow watches and shrink watches, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6693.92s)]
*  speed them up, slow them down, in order to get in control [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6697.08s)]
*  of the thing that we thought was space time? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6700.620000000001s)]
*  The next issue is, are there multiple temporal dimensions? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6704.400000000001s)]
*  So Eric, your friend who's had too much coffee, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6709.64s)]
*  believes that there are either six [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6713.96s)]
*  or four extra temporal dimensions, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6715.44s)]
*  and whatever isn't temporal is spatial. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6717.799999999999s)]
*  So it's either four plus six, or six plus four [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6720.759999999999s)]
*  extra dimensions split between time and space. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6723.32s)]
*  If that's true, try to imagine [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6727.04s)]
*  extradimensional engineers who have full access [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6732.0599999999995s)]
*  to something where there's no arrow of time. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6736.839999999999s)]
*  The only time there's an arrow of time [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6740.139999999999s)]
*  is if time is one dimensional. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6741.86s)]
*  If time is two dimensional, you have a whirlpool of time, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6744.2s)]
*  which is either clockwise or counterclockwise. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6748.2s)]
*  If it's three dimensional, you have a right-hand rule [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6750.719999999999s)]
*  of time, and there's a left-hand rule of time. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6753.28s)]
*  These are called orientations. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6755.719999999999s)]
*  My belief is that we may be looking at something [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6758.12s)]
*  that has access to either four or six additional dimensions. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6761.88s)]
*  And again, I'm reading this off of a page [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6765.48s)]
*  of equations and notes, and so you know what they mean [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6768.5599999999995s)]
*  in physical reality. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6772.92s)]
*  In other words, if this thing on the page is true, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6773.92s)]
*  holy shit. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6777.4400000000005s)]
*  On the other hand, if it's just some geometry, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6779.04s)]
*  then you don't worry about it. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6781.16s)]
*  You say, okay, well, extra dimensions, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6782.24s)]
*  I can think in 17 or three, or what, doesn't matter. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6783.8s)]
*  It's not that hard to think in higher dimensions spatially [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6786.76s)]
*  for people who do what I do. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6790.52s)]
*  Almost none of us can think in multiple temporal dimensions. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6792.8s)]
*  There's one guy in Los Angeles at USC [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6795.36s)]
*  called Yitzhak Barz, a Turkish Jew, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6798.04s)]
*  who keeps talking about two-time physics, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6800.88s)]
*  and I've spoken to him. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6803.68s)]
*  But multiple temporal dimensions [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6805.400000000001s)]
*  would be a decisive game changer [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6807.08s)]
*  in terms of changing everything [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6810.04s)]
*  that we know about the world. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6811.68s)]
*  And what would be the technology [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6813.08s)]
*  that someone could use to access that? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6814.88s)]
*  Because that's the big thing. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6818.6s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6820.36s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6823.08s)]
*  You and I are both old enough to remember cassette tapes [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6825.32s)]
*  and vinyl albums. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6827.24s)]
*  On a cassette tape, you've played your favorite album [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6828.96s)]
*  all the way through, like Dark Side of the Moon, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6831.92s)]
*  and you want to play it again. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6834.6s)]
*  You have to rewind through every song you just played, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6837.04s)]
*  and you hear, right? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6840.6s)]
*  But that doesn't happen on an album. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6843.400000000001s)]
*  Towards the end of the turntable time, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6845.0s)]
*  you would just, the stylus would pick up, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6847.64s)]
*  and it would skip over all the stuff [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6850.4800000000005s)]
*  that you didn't want to hear again, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6852.12s)]
*  and it would go back to some track that you did. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6853.96s)]
*  Imagine you could do that with time. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6856.12s)]
*  You didn't have to go back through time [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6857.5199999999995s)]
*  to go back in time. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6859.68s)]
*  Do I even know what I mean? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6861.92s)]
*  Not really. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6863.12s)]
*  I'm sort of at the edge of where I can actually say things. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6864.48s)]
*  But you see, all of physics proceeds from the time, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6867.5199999999995s)]
*  from the assumption that time is one-dimensional. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6870.64s)]
*  We have this thing called deterministic propagation. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6873.04s)]
*  So if you take quantum mechanics, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6876.16s)]
*  there are really two rules. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6877.96s)]
*  One is completely deterministic with no probability theory. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6879.5199999999995s)]
*  You've got to know that. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6882.44s)]
*  You've got to know that. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6883.28s)]
*  You're deterministic with no probability theory. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6884.16s)]
*  You've got a system. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6885.8s)]
*  You know its initial conditions, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6887.16s)]
*  and you say, if I know the laws of physics, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6888.44s)]
*  I should be able to figure out where this is. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6890.08s)]
*  You know, I take this lighter, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6893.08s)]
*  and I throw it up, and I catch it, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6894.76s)]
*  and it described a parabola. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6897.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6899.44s)]
*  Initial condition, propagation, I measure it. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6900.68s)]
*  It's completely determined by the point of release. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6904.2s)]
*  In quantum mechanics, you have the second thing [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6908.2s)]
*  called quantum measurement, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6910.12s)]
*  and that is this weird probabilistic thing [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6912.5199999999995s)]
*  that nobody understands. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6914.639999999999s)]
*  Everybody says, if you think you don't understand [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6915.759999999999s)]
*  the quantum, you don't understand it. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6917.639999999999s)]
*  It's mind-blowing, blah, blah, blah. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6919.04s)]
*  But the first part of it is where we're trying [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6921.44s)]
*  to fit gravity, and when we quantize it. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6923.32s)]
*  I don't think gravity goes in that slot. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6927.08s)]
*  I think that what you do is you don't quantize gravity. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6929.24s)]
*  You harmonize gravity. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6931.16s)]
*  Gravity is the observer. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6933.0s)]
*  We say, well, when you make an observation, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6936.12s)]
*  well, who's doing the observation? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6937.799999999999s)]
*  Is Joe doing the observation? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6939.0s)]
*  Is Jamie doing the observation? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6940.16s)]
*  Who's doing this observation? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6941.44s)]
*  Who has the right to use the second rule [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6942.5599999999995s)]
*  for collapsing the state vector with Schrodinger's cat [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6945.16s)]
*  and all entanglement weirdness? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6947.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's gravity. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6950.839999999999s)]
*  I think that part of the story is that gravity [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6952.639999999999s)]
*  is the observer through something called [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6955.48s)]
*  a pullback operation. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6957.08s)]
*  And when you realize that, you realize that you don't [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6959.639999999999s)]
*  naively quantize gravity the way you quantize [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6962.759999999999s)]
*  everything else. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6965.599999999999s)]
*  In fact, gravity is the only field living on the successor [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6966.5199999999995s)]
*  to space time, if I'm correct. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6971.28s)]
*  There are two spaces called X and Y. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6973.12s)]
*  All the cool stuff in here, the electrons, the quarks [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6975.16s)]
*  that make up everything that you and I are, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6978.28s)]
*  is living on Y, except for the metric, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6980.96s)]
*  the rulers and the protractors, which lives on X, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6984.5599999999995s)]
*  which is how you keep gravity separate. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6986.88s)]
*  And the unification is the unification of these two things [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6989.32s)]
*  in a structure called a bundle. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6992.32s)]
*  Now, people will go over this, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6994.12s)]
*  and I'm sure professors will say, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6996.48s)]
*  well, this is what Eric was saying. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6998.759999999999s)]
*  Well, he's full of shit. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=6999.92s)]
*  No, no, no, he's actually making a point. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7000.76s)]
*  This story about space time engineering, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7003.4800000000005s)]
*  where you don't use the Einstein field equations [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7007.88s)]
*  because you're using the successor theory rather than, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7010.280000000001s)]
*  in the Einstein theory, the entire planet was pulling on you [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7013.2s)]
*  when you needed to go pee. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7017.24s)]
*  And your legs, I mean, they're obviously buff, you're fit. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7019.360000000001s)]
*  You just pulled against an entire planet [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7022.64s)]
*  to get out of your chair, and you won. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7024.76s)]
*  That's how weak gravity is. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7027.76s)]
*  That's how space and time is barely bent by all of Earth. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7029.08s)]
*  Now, you're gonna tell me about an Alcubierre warp drive [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7034.44s)]
*  where, okay, no, here's what's going on. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7038.0s)]
*  The ship is inside of this little bubble of warping. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7039.96s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7042.76s)]
*  If somebody's space time engineering, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7044.88s)]
*  and they can get here from very far away, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7046.68s)]
*  they're not using general relativity [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7049.8s)]
*  in the standard model, my friends. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7051.36s)]
*  They're using a successor theory, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7053.5199999999995s)]
*  and we have become pussies. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7055.0s)]
*  We are not going to look at successor theories [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7057.08s)]
*  because we've all learned the lesson [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7060.36s)]
*  that everybody who tries to bet [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7062.04s)]
*  against the standard model loses. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7063.24s)]
*  Everybody who bets against general relativity loses. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7065.36s)]
*  And this is that speech that Morpheus has to give. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7068.08s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie to you, Neo. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7070.76s)]
*  Everyone who's ever faced an agent [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7072.6s)]
*  who stood his ground has died. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7074.32s)]
*  It's like, okay, tough shit. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7077.0s)]
*  Now it's time. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7079.64s)]
*  Are we Americans? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7080.6s)]
*  Are we scientists? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7081.44s)]
*  Are we cowboys? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7082.26s)]
*  You know, please tell me we're Travis Pastrana [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7083.4s)]
*  and not some sort of diversity, equity, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7087.679999999999s)]
*  and inclusion committee. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7089.599999999999s)]
*  How is it that we move forward? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7091.639999999999s)]
*  Well, we take the ultimate risk, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7094.88s)]
*  and what do we do with it? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7096.44s)]
*  Our credibility. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7097.28s)]
*  Watch my Wikipedia entry as I try to do this. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7098.12s)]
*  But what do you think they're using [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7101.599999999999s)]
*  in terms of a technology to achieve these results? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7103.92s)]
*  And do you think that this is being examined [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7106.599999999999s)]
*  and this is being researched here on Earth, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7110.72s)]
*  or do you think we are being visited? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7114.18s)]
*  I don't know, but I know that if I were [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7115.14s)]
*  the federal government, if I was the Department of Energy, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7117.26s)]

*  and somebody went on the Joe Rogan Experience [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7124.9400000000005s)]

*  One of the last times I went on, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7134.46s)]

*  the FBI called me immediately. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7137.54s)]

*  Well, what did they talk to you about? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7157.7s)]
*  We're concerned about some of the stuff you were saying. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7160.06s)]
*  I think they thought I sounded revolutionary, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7164.22s)]
*  like it's time for heads on pikes. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7165.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7168.26s)]
*  That. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7170.7s)]
*  Because Tulsi would put heads on pikes, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7173.14s)]
*  because Tulsi is like, like VAD the impaler. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7175.1s)]
*  She's gonna be going around with a chainsaw, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7179.38s)]
*  actually cutting people's heads off. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7181.9400000000005s)]
*  She probably should phrase it differently. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7183.42s)]
*  Oh stop, Joe, you say stuff all. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7185.22s)]
*  Problematic. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7187.22s)]
*  You say in MMA, that guy's a straight up killer. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7190.26s)]
*  He's an assassin. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7193.42s)]
*  You don't get a call from the FBI. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7194.740000000001s)]
*  No, that's true, that's true, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7196.06s)]
*  but that is actually a compliment. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7197.54s)]
*  If you use that for Aaron Blanchfield. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7200.26s)]
*  In any event, I get occasionally called [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7202.62s)]
*  by somebody from inside. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7204.7s)]
*  And what I think they're doing, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7206.780000000001s)]
*  first of all, one, we may be faking a UFO situation [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7210.34s)]
*  for reasons that I don't understand. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7214.22s)]
*  If we are faking a UFO situation, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7215.900000000001s)]
*  do you think that there's technology that's available [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7218.1s)]
*  to people in the United States [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7220.820000000001s)]
*  that is beyond our current understanding of what's possible? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7222.860000000001s)]
*  90% no. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7228.42s)]
*  90% no. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7229.9400000000005s)]
*  Because it's very hard to imagine physicists [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7232.1s)]
*  continuing to work on nothing for their entire careers. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7236.46s)]
*  The number of people who are gonna be retiring shortly, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7240.58s)]
*  having never actually done physics as a physicist. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7243.18s)]
*  We're talking about wasted lives. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7247.62s)]
*  People are going to be very weird [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7249.1s)]
*  when they realize that they blew their entire career. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7251.5s)]
*  And I believe I can say what many of these problems are. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7255.1s)]
*  And if you want to humiliate me at a leading university, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7257.9800000000005s)]
*  just ask me to talk, you can put it on video. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7260.14s)]
*  You don't realize how many things the standard model [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7262.9400000000005s)]
*  has subtly wrong when we explain it to people. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7266.54s)]
*  It's not that the Lagrangian is wrong, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7269.38s)]
*  not that the rules are wrong, but we say wrong stuff. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7271.06s)]
*  We say like, there are three generations that are only [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7274.58s)]
*  of matter that are only distinguished by mass. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7276.780000000001s)]
*  In other words, there's three copies of this stuff here. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7278.780000000001s)]
*  This is like the wood version and then there's the [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7283.14s)]
*  plastic version and then there's the metal version. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7285.34s)]
*  There aren't three, there are two generations [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7289.22s)]
*  plus an extra imposter generation, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7291.3s)]
*  which looks like a generation. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7293.1s)]
*  I mean, I can get into these things. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7294.26s)]
*  And that should be a provocation that somebody says, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7295.66s)]
*  let's call this guy up, have him out, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7297.5s)]
*  and figure out what he's talking about. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7298.9800000000005s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7300.74s)]
*  I don't think we're doing physics. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7302.18s)]
*  What do you think they're doing? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7305.06s)]
*  I think we are playing paintball rather than going to war [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7306.62s)]
*  and we're giving prizes for generals [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7310.7s)]
*  who command the best paintball army. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7312.74s)]
*  And then we're referencing everyone else [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7315.7s)]
*  who's actually trying to figure out how to fight. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7317.74s)]
*  Well, have you submitted to the paintball competition? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7321.74s)]
*  It's like, no, I don't want to do paintball. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7324.7s)]
*  I understand that it keeps your skills up. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7327.139999999999s)]
*  I understand that some of them are transferable. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7329.139999999999s)]
*  But I mean, like you've been in street fights. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7331.78s)]
*  Not since I was a teenager. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7335.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I understand. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7336.099999999999s)]
*  I haven't been for a long time. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7337.5s)]
*  It's different than what you guys do in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7340.18s)]
*  There's lots of stuff you're not allowed to do. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7343.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7345.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7346.3s)]
*  You get in a street fight, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7347.12s)]
*  it's a completely different thing. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7347.96s)]
*  Sure. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7348.9800000000005s)]
*  What we're doing is not physics in the same sense. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7351.42s)]
*  So what they're doing is they're exercising. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7355.06s)]
*  We're doing safe stuff. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7358.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7359.9400000000005s)]
*  They're exercising. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7360.900000000001s)]
*  And the exercises are keeping people limber. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7361.740000000001s)]
*  They're keeping people in a fighting mentality. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7364.66s)]
*  It's not that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7367.22s)]
*  has nothing to do with fighting. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7368.780000000001s)]
*  We've seen people use it in the street for sure, right? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7369.78s)]
*  But small joint manipulation is part of street fighting. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7372.94s)]
*  Eye gouging is part of street fighting. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7376.38s)]
*  Pulling a knife is part of street fighting. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7378.0199999999995s)]
*  These things are not part of any reputable gym [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7380.46s)]
*  that you might go to. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7383.259999999999s)]
*  So I wanna do the thing that isn't paintball. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7384.82s)]
*  And I didn't want to do it up until recently [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7390.5s)]
*  because the danger of unleashing a neutron on the world [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7393.0599999999995s)]
*  is so high. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7397.82s)]
*  Now I realize I'm done with that. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7398.7s)]
*  You guys are willing to play footsies with Putin. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7400.66s)]
*  You're not gonna survive. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7403.24s)]
*  You're not the responsible adults I thought you were. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7404.66s)]
*  Like, if I unleash a neutron [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7407.5s)]
*  and it leads to some sort of proliferation [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7410.0599999999995s)]
*  of deadly technology, it's on you. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7412.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not on me. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7414.34s)]
*  You're already taking risks that you shouldn't be taking. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7416.9s)]
*  So if you think 90% sure [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7420.62s)]
*  that this is not coming from here, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7426.5s)]
*  you believe this because you don't think [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7427.92s)]
*  that the proper science in order to achieve [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7430.4800000000005s)]
*  these kind of results is being done by the people [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7432.52s)]
*  that you believe are capable of doing it? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7435.12s)]
*  That is correct. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7437.6s)]
*  I know that, for example, when I talk to Nima [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7438.4400000000005s)]
*  or when I talk to Juan Maldacena [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7442.24s)]
*  or when I've talked to Natty Seiberg, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7444.12s)]
*  these people are absolutely brilliant [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7445.8s)]
*  and they don't know the answer [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7448.6s)]
*  unless they're the greatest actors I've ever seen. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7449.72s)]
*  So the most brilliant physicists are looking at these [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7451.8s)]
*  supposed videos. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7457.0s)]
*  What is the best and most compelling? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7458.12s)]
*  Sorry, that's UFO stuff. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7460.2s)]
*  What are you talking about, then? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7461.6s)]
*  They're not talking about things that can extend Einstein. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7463.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7467.32s)]
*  That therefore, to get back to your technology question, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7468.16s)]
*  might have engineering applications [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7471.08s)]
*  because it's the engineering applications [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7473.2s)]
*  that are terrifying. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7475.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7476.32s)]
*  Right, the discovery of the neutron was one thing. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7477.16s)]
*  The Teller-Ulam design was its weaponization. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7478.3s)]
*  So suddenly, you know, you can do the Tsar Bomb [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7482.12s)]
*  or Castle Bravo, these unbelievable explosions, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7485.799999999999s)]
*  which, like the difference between, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7490.0s)]
*  there were Civil War veterans [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7494.879999999999s)]
*  who saw action in the Civil War [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7496.879999999999s)]
*  who lived to see Ivy Mike in the Pacific. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7498.4s)]
*  So the Civil War was almost a thermonuclear war [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7503.04s)]
*  in terms of human scale. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7506.0s)]
*  It's less than 100 years different. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7508.16s)]
*  So, people have forgotten how terrifying, important, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7510.36s)]
*  wonderful, jaw-dropping, and awesome physics is [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7515.36s)]
*  because it hasn't done anything [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7518.679999999999s)]
*  that completely screws your mind. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7520.08s)]
*  Like Hiroshima or Nagasaki. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7523.2s)]
*  Or Castle Bravo. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7525.759999999999s)]
*  With Castle Bravo. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7527.799999999999s)]
*  That was the test in the Pacific [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7528.839999999999s)]
*  where we thought it was gonna be controlled [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7530.799999999999s)]
*  and like, or what is it, starfish, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7533.639999999999s)]
*  where we did an atmospheric explosion over Hawaii, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7536.08s)]
*  and then the Russians like, hold my beer, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7538.64s)]
*  no vasemillium. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7540.92s)]
*  Pfft. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7542.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7542.96s)]
*  You know, remember, I'm the guy five years ago [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7543.780000000001s)]
*  who was saying we need above-ground nuclear tests [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7547.0s)]
*  because all you people have lost your fear. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7550.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, yes, Eric is crazy, but he's correct. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7552.4800000000005s)]
*  What's this one? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7556.56s)]
*  That's Castle Bravo. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7558.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, shit. Oh my God. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7559.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7562.76s)]
*  So they detonated in that facility [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7563.92s)]
*  and they expected it to be far smaller than it was? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7565.96s)]
*  They detonated in the Pacific. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7569.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7570.12s)]
*  But it's right next to that facility that was in the video. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7572.12s)]
*  Was that the facility that was initially filmed? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7575.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7579.08s)]
*  What is this facility? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7579.92s)]
*  That's it. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7580.759999999999s)]
*  It was Inawok, I forget, Atoll. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7581.599999999999s)]
*  So, like, we just- [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7585.5199999999995s)]
*  It's crazy how long ago that was [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7587.36s)]
*  and how close it was to the Civil War [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7589.24s)]
*  if you really put it in that context. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7590.799999999999s)]
*  Well, this is what I'm trying to say is, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7592.32s)]
*  what I'm trying to tell you. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7594.759999999999s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7596.5599999999995s)]
*  That's so insane. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7599.36s)]
*  Have you done this in Oculus? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7600.679999999999s)]
*  No, I have not. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7602.44s)]
*  I highly recommend it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7603.28s)]
*  They're not gonna let us do a nuke above ground [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7604.48s)]
*  so that we can save ourselves by fear. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7607.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7609.719999999999s)]
*  Right, this is religious stuff, Joe. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7612.24s)]
*  Yeah, it is religious stuff. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7614.759999999999s)]
*  Like, we have announced, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7615.599999999999s)]
*  if somebody is listening to these tests that we did, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7618.44s)]
*  my belief is very shortly before you get the ability [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7622.839999999999s)]
*  to traverse the cosmos, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7626.24s)]
*  if that is possible, if that is possible, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7628.72s)]
*  you let off a nuke. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7631.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7634.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7635.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, you've had kids. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7636.5199999999995s)]
*  There's some stuff that happens right before they figure [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7639.2s)]
*  how to break out of the crib. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7641.28s)]
*  You know, that's part of UFO folklore, too. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7642.88s)]
*  I know. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7645.24s)]
*  Fat Man and Little Boy. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7646.08s)]
*  That's a big part of UFO. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7647.5199999999995s)]
*  Once they drop those, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7649.12s)]
*  that's when all the UFOs started appearing. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7650.4s)]
*  So the question is, you know, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7653.56s)]
*  the analogy I give, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7657.24s)]
*  so I talked to Avi about the following thing. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7659.2s)]
*  I am a fan of something I call the doubly scientific method. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7661.16s)]
*  The usual scientific method makes a hidden assumption [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7665.44s)]
*  that it never voices, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7668.32s)]
*  which is if we're gonna study orcas, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7670.08s)]
*  we assume that we are smarter than orcas, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7671.679999999999s)]
*  or if we're gonna study cephalopods, right, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7673.759999999999s)]
*  like an octopus. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7676.719999999999s)]
*  We think we're smarter. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7678.16s)]
*  And what do we do? [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7680.2s)]
*  We disguise ourselves. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7681.48s)]
*  We create artificial environments. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7683.679999999999s)]
*  We do all sorts of crazy things based on the fact [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7685.4s)]
*  that we're smarter than what we study, [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7688.08s)]
*  from everything from rocks to orcas. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7689.92s)]
*  The doubly scientific method says, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7693.5599999999995s)]
*  okay, assume that you're studying a rat in a maze, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7695.599999999999s)]
*  but you yourself are the rat in somebody else's maze. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7698.16s)]
*  Now you have to look up the intelligence scale, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7701.719999999999s)]
*  not just down. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7704.679999999999s)]
*  And in the doubly scientific method, [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7706.32s)]
*  you have to assume that whatever is studying you [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7707.96s)]
*  is hiding from you the way you are hiding [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7710.24s)]
*  from your subjects. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7712.599999999999s)]
*  So if you see somebody in a duck blind, for example, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7714.04s)]
*  and he's studying ducks, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7716.08s)]
*  you understand that somebody may be hiding from you, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7717.8s)]
*  and they might be able to use multiple dimensions of time. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7720.84s)]
*  They might be able to cloak themselves [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7723.12s)]
*  and disguise themselves. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7724.5199999999995s)]
*  Or for example, if you take microscopic UFOs, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7725.4s)]
*  this cup has a radius of R and a circumference of two pi R. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7730.68s)]
*  The disc that it spans is pi R squared in area. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7737.2s)]
*  But if you look at this cup, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7740.84s)]
*  it's much larger than pi R squared, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7741.92s)]
*  because we pushed it out. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7743.72s)]
*  You could have a sphere [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7746.16s)]
*  where if you could cheaply engineer space time, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7748.360000000001s)]
*  not through the Einstein field equations, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7750.84s)]
*  but through the successor theory that recovers Einstein, [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7752.360000000001s)]
*  you could have an entire stadium inside of a tennis ball, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7755.400000000001s)]
*  just the way this cup doesn't blow your mind [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7759.72s)]
*  until you realize that its area [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7762.2s)]
*  is much greater than pi R squared. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7763.64s)]
*  You could, why look for a giant floating thing in the sky? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7766.16s)]
*  If you could bend space and time, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7769.68s)]
*  and you could play with the rulers the way I'm saying, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7771.56s)]
*  I would put this in a tiny little profile. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7775.240000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7779.0s)]
*  So we're only looking at it in terms of our understanding [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7780.72s)]
*  of the distance between objects, planets, gravity. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7785.72s)]
*  We're looking at that. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7790.0s)]
*  All that stuff where if it didn't exist, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7791.52s)]
*  if somehow or another we lived in some contained environment [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7794.400000000001s)]
*  and we had no concept of space whatsoever, [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7797.4800000000005s)]
*  and then we gained access to it, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7799.320000000001s)]
*  we would be unbelievably overwhelmed. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7801.76s)]
*  If you lived in some sort of underground facility [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7803.88s)]
*  your entire life, and then one day you got a chance [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7807.0s)]
*  to go outside and see the Keck Observatory in Hawaii [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7809.72s)]
*  in a clear night with no moon, you would be overwhelmed. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7813.88s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to believe that the world [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7817.88s)]
*  was as big as it really was, [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7820.5599999999995s)]
*  or that the universe was as big as it was. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7821.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's an impedance mismatch. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7823.68s)]
*  If you watch meteor showers the way my family does, [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7825.48s)]
*  it's religious, it's transformational, it's transcendent. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7831.5599999999995s)]
*  The problem, as you know, from the default mode network, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7836.12s)]
*  is that mostly what your brain is doing [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7841.36s)]
*  is not communicating information, but screening. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7843.28s)]
*  Your eyes, your fovea is precious, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7847.0s)]
*  because that's the thing that can resolve [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7849.04s)]
*  at very high levels. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7850.44s)]
*  But I can barely see Jamie out of the corner of my eye [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7851.68s)]
*  because my peripheral vision can't be at the same level [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7854.84s)]
*  as my fovea, I'd be overwhelmed. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7857.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7859.0s)]
*  So we're talking about tapping in to a picture of the world [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7860.56s)]
*  that we are not, our brain is not prepared for the idea [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7864.2s)]
*  that time is multi-dimensional. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7869.0s)]
*  That was the whole point of giving Lex another watch. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7870.52s)]
*  We don't have a way to think about it. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7874.24s)]
*  I'll meet you at 5.15 and 12.30, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7875.4800000000005s)]
*  according to two different scales of time. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7879.12s)]
*  Or for example, time and space, if I'm correct, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7881.72s)]
*  the 14-dimensional manifold [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7884.24s)]
*  that has all the quantum going on on it [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7886.24s)]
*  is split probably seven and seven dimensions, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7889.08s)]
*  because we have six extra time dimensions [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7891.88s)]
*  and four extra space, add six to one and three to four, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7893.5599999999995s)]
*  and you get seven. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7897.2s)]
*  So space and time are interchangeable. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7898.48s)]
*  There's a duality between them. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7901.8s)]
*  All of this stuff is like, you know, okay, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7903.679999999999s)]
*  how you hit on chicks in a bar, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7907.4s)]
*  hey, let me tell you something about space and time [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7909.599999999999s)]
*  you never thought about. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7911.76s)]
*  Oh my God, does that work? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7912.76s)]
*  What? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7914.24s)]
*  Worked for me? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7915.2s)]
*  That's why I'm not in better shape. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7918.92s)]
*  So do you think, now when you were talking [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7920.04s)]
*  about these people that keep manana-ing you [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7923.28s)]
*  and not giving you access to whatever they're talking about, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7926.76s)]
*  do you think they're talking about [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7930.719999999999s)]
*  some sort of an engineering solution [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7932.16s)]
*  to this type of technology? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7935.32s)]
*  I haven't met anyone in striking distance in three years. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7937.2s)]
*  So how could they have something [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7941.28s)]
*  that's gonna change your way of looking? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7943.36s)]
*  Is it possible that you've missed something? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7945.32s)]
*  I can just be wrong, first of all. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7948.28s)]
*  This is my life's work, right? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7951.96s)]
*  What is the way they phrase it to you? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7953.799999999999s)]
*  Which part? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7955.92s)]
*  The part about it changing the way you see the world. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7956.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, Eric, you know, I'll complain about data. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7959.08s)]
*  Like, that's not the data we have. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7963.5199999999995s)]
*  What we've been showing the public is down sampled, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7965.44s)]
*  meaning it's fuzzier, it's low resolution. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7967.839999999999s)]
*  Like, how clear is it? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7972.08s)]
*  As clear as you want. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7974.799999999999s)]
*  How clear are you that there's something to see? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7976.599999999999s)]
*  You can see it with your own eyes. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7979.24s)]
*  There's no question. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7982.839999999999s)]
*  Dude, if I was you, I'd just shut the fuck up [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7984.04s)]
*  and let them show me. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7985.719999999999s)]
*  I'd be like, let's go. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7987.24s)]
*  I'm not under any NDA. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7988.48s)]
*  I know, but I'm saying, I... [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7990.0s)]
*  But you want to know. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7991.839999999999s)]
*  I wanna know. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7993.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I wanna know in a different... [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7993.92s)]
*  Look, my life's work is a theory. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7995.12s)]
*  It's one theory. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7997.32s)]
*  My entire life is really about one theory, okay? [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=7998.32s)]
*  Like, I do this entertainment thing [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8002.36s)]
*  and I talk to people and all this stuff. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8003.92s)]
*  Bullshit. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8006.08s)]
*  Really what I am is an academic who realized [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8006.92s)]
*  that you can't do academics inside of the university system [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8008.88s)]
*  and watch it disintegrate into madness as we speak. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8011.48s)]
*  I figured this out a long time ago. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8015.2s)]
*  I wanna know whether this is right or wrong so much better, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8021.08s)]
*  so much more than I wanna know whether UFOs exist. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8023.719999999999s)]
*  UFOs to me are an indication of whether I'm right or wrong. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8026.28s)]
*  It's an input to me. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8031.44s)]
*  So if you're right, that means... [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8033.48s)]
*  If we have a future, it means we can leave [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8035.799999999999s)]
*  not the planet, but the solar system. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8038.0s)]
*  We can explore... [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8039.839999999999s)]
*  The cosmos are traversable. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8040.679999999999s)]
*  If we can leave, anything else can visit. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8043.28s)]
*  If you look at the entirety of the universe [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8047.08s)]
*  and you imagine that ultimately there are societies [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8049.0s)]
*  that destroy themselves because they get atomic weapons [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8052.24s)]
*  before they figure out how to leave. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8055.0s)]
*  Some societies are smarter than that [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8057.48s)]
*  and they'll be able to leave and colonize the cosmos. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8059.92s)]
*  And for them not to be here would be madness. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8063.08s)]
*  So if you've heard my analogy, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8065.84s)]
*  there is an island in the Andaman chain [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8069.32s)]
*  called North Sentinel Island. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8072.0s)]
*  I know it well. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8074.4800000000005s)]
*  North Sentinel Island is my model potentially of us. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8075.4400000000005s)]
*  We are the North Sentinelese. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8079.84s)]
*  The 39 people that are direct descendants [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8081.76s)]
*  of people who left Africa 60,000 years ago. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8084.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8086.72s)]
*  We don't know if there's 39 or 300. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8087.92s)]
*  They kill everybody who lands there essentially. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8090.92s)]
*  There's a story that we actually buggered them. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8093.320000000001s)]
*  An English person buggered them, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8096.0s)]
*  which is why they don't want anyone landing. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8097.240000000001s)]
*  There actually are some very weird videos [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8099.6s)]
*  where we throw them coconuts [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8101.8s)]
*  because coconuts don't occur in their island [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8103.0s)]
*  and we actually have non-hostile contact. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8104.84s)]
*  But the most important part of it is India. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8107.0s)]
*  They do not know that they are claimed [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8110.400000000001s)]
*  by something called India. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8112.8s)]
*  And they don't know that they have a Fermi problem [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8114.4800000000005s)]
*  because India won't let anyone land [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8116.44s)]
*  unless they break the law. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8118.4s)]
*  So the great filter of North Sentinel Island [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8120.919999999999s)]
*  is a model for why don't we see anybody? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8123.04s)]
*  Why aren't we clear? [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8126.32s)]
*  Does India exist at some sort of UFO level? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8128.08s)]
*  Now this is the doubly scientific method. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8132.48s)]
*  You can laugh at it, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8134.28s)]
*  but then would you laugh at the North Sentinelese [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8135.32s)]
*  who are smart enough to say, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8137.48s)]
*  I wonder if there's another society [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8139.04s)]
*  that's screening everybody from landing here. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8140.719999999999s)]
*  Now what happens on North Sentinel Island [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8143.56s)]
*  if you're watching it [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8145.64s)]
*  and all these people with loincloths [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8146.48s)]
*  or no loincloths and spears and arrows and stupid stuff, [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8147.68s)]
*  suddenly you start hearing radio signals [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8150.88s)]
*  coming out of North Sentinel Island. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8153.68s)]
*  You're like, what? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8155.12s)]
*  Then you see a little mushroom cloud [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8157.12s)]
*  in the northeast of the island. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8158.48s)]
*  Then you see little boats that start exploring around [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8160.12s)]
*  that seem to be propelled internally. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8163.16s)]
*  You're like, are they burning the leaves? [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8164.92s)]
*  Have they invented internal combustion? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8166.68s)]
*  Some point with the mushroom cloud, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8168.32s)]
*  India says enough is enough. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8169.92s)]
*  India says enough is enough. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8171.36s)]
*  We cannot afford to let the North Sentinelese be treated [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8172.639999999999s)]
*  as some sort of backwards people [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8176.4s)]
*  who don't have anything developed that scares us. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8178.28s)]
*  That's a mushroom cloud, man. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8181.2s)]
*  That's time to go in. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8182.719999999999s)]
*  I see. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8185.4s)]
*  Right? [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8186.24s)]
*  So my claim is, is that you're not used [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8187.08s)]
*  to the doubly scientific method [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8188.32s)]
*  because there's been no reason [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8189.839999999999s)]
*  to have a doubly scientific method. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8191.04s)]
*  Do you believe that the orcas are smarter? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8192.48s)]
*  Well, possibly. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8194.32s)]
*  There aren't that many species [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8195.92s)]
*  that are really smarter than us. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8197.08s)]
*  Look at all the shit we do. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8198.32s)]
*  There aren't many that are dumber than us either. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8200.64s)]
*  But not my point. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8202.2s)]
*  Those sorts of models are what distinguish people [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8204.44s)]
*  who are gonna get called crazy but aren't [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8208.36s)]
*  because it's an obvious point. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8210.84s)]
*  You have to account for this possibility [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8212.6s)]
*  that there's something called India up in the skies [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8215.0s)]
*  that doesn't want anyone landing here. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8217.960000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8219.720000000001s)]
*  Who's monitoring what's going on [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8220.56s)]
*  and they're not going to be infinitely patient [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8222.4s)]
*  if they exist. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8224.76s)]
*  Now, if that's true and we can leave [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8226.56s)]
*  and we can't civilize ourselves [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8228.84s)]
*  and we bring this mad technology with us, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8231.08s)]
*  this ability to destroy, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8233.48s)]
*  I personally feel responsible [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8235.84s)]
*  in a way that my colleagues don't. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8237.599999999999s)]
*  They have these ideas like, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8240.0s)]
*  oh, I'm a physicist. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8240.84s)]
*  It's just fun. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8241.88s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8242.72s)]
*  It's a bunch of puzzles. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8243.539999999999s)]
*  My feeling is you doomed the human race [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8244.38s)]
*  and you don't feel responsible for building a lifeboat, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8247.0s)]
*  for saving us, for like, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8252.32s)]
*  what kind of a sociopath are you? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8256.48s)]
*  Like, I'm not even a physicist, Joe, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8259.359999999999s)]
*  and I feel responsible. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8261.84s)]
*  And this gets back to some weird stuff about. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8264.72s)]
*  So they're not thinking about that. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8269.48s)]
*  They're thinking about the equations they're working on. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8271.039999999999s)]
*  They're thinking about the puzzles they're trying to solve. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8272.88s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8274.88s)]
*  I get to play. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8275.72s)]
*  It's universe this and puzzle that. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8276.56s)]
*  And it's just like, please. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8279.24s)]
*  It's not. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8281.0s)]
*  Do they not think of a way to leave the earth [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8282.8s)]
*  because they don't think it's a surmountable? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8286.64s)]
*  Correct. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8288.8s)]
*  They live in space time. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8289.62s)]
*  They've crawled into the map, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8290.56s)]
*  the prison built by Einstein, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8292.56s)]
*  and they know that it's not right. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8294.960000000001s)]
*  Because there are these two singularities. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8298.08s)]
*  There's this singularity at the beginning of time, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8300.44s)]
*  which we call the Big Bang, [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8302.72s)]
*  assuming the time we're one dimensional. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8304.56s)]
*  And it's part of something called [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8306.06s)]
*  the Friedman-Robertson-Walker space time model. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8307.4s)]
*  And there's another one at the bottom of the black hole [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8310.36s)]
*  called the Schwarzschild singularity. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8312.76s)]
*  And the fact that space and time kink at these two points [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8314.88s)]
*  is an indication that we have something wrong [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8318.68s)]
*  to a mathematician or a physicist. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8321.48s)]
*  It says your equations work pretty well [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8323.119999999999s)]
*  right up into the point where there's some error [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8325.6s)]
*  that you have that you don't understand [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8328.6s)]
*  and you have like a division by zero error. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8330.16s)]
*  And if you could figure out your error, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8334.279999999999s)]
*  you don't know what sin you committed, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8335.84s)]
*  but the way that you know you committed a sin [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8337.119999999999s)]
*  is that you have a singularity. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8338.84s)]
*  So they know that there's some successor theory, [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8340.44s)]
*  and they'll give lectures about space-time is doomed, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8343.2s)]
*  and I'm gonna talk about non-commutative geometry, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8345.880000000001s)]
*  but these are all ways of avoiding the fact [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8348.36s)]
*  that you haven't done your homework for 50 years, okay? [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8350.16s)]
*  So like there's some class that you're supposed to show up to [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8353.08s)]
*  and you haven't been in a long time. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8355.04s)]
*  You don't wanna show up and suddenly say, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8356.8s)]
*  what, what's going on? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8358.44s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8362.36s)]
*  They are living inside of Einstein's model. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8363.880000000001s)]
*  So when you say something, they'll say, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8366.24s)]
*  well, that's impossible [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8367.32s)]
*  because you can't go faster than the speed of light. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8369.08s)]
*  And it's like, that's a space-time concept. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8370.92s)]
*  That's an Einsteinian concept. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8373.16s)]
*  You're not thinking post-Einsteinian. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8374.4s)]
*  You're not thinking about recovering Einstein, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8376.0s)]
*  or Einstein is what we would call an effective theory. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8377.96s)]
*  You're thinking that you really live in space-time [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8380.92s)]
*  so you know what you can do. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8383.0s)]
*  And then you fold your arms and say, well, that's impossible. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8384.44s)]
*  It's like, no, you have a limited map. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8386.84s)]
*  You think that Greenland is the same size [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8389.72s)]
*  as South America. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8392.92s)]
*  Okay, then as far as its application, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8395.4s)]
*  what could you imagine would be a way [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8399.96s)]
*  that someone could actually apply these laws, these theories? [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8403.6s)]
*  So imagine for the moment, again, this goes back to, [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8409.68s)]
*  let me put my, Eric, the science person [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8412.72s)]
*  doing his own theory, right? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8417.64s)]
*  This is my thing that I tried to give you [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8419.119999999999s)]
*  last time I was here. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8420.84s)]
*  If we imagine that there are two spaces, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8425.52s)]
*  and one of them is 14-dimensional, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8429.359999999999s)]
*  and one of them is four-dimensional, [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8431.0s)]
*  and gravity connects them, that is the metric, the gadget. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8432.32s)]
*  Think of a phonograph. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8437.8s)]
*  The record is like the 14-dimensional world. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8439.72s)]
*  And are you a Doors fan? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8443.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8445.039999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you've got Doors one, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8445.88s)]
*  Break On Through to the other side [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8448.039999999999s)]
*  is on the same side as Soul Kitchen. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8449.48s)]
*  You don't hear Break On Through to the other side [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8452.84s)]
*  or Soul Kitchen simultaneously. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8454.8s)]
*  They're both there on the record. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8457.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8459.759999999998s)]
*  The phonograph, imagine you're doing it [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8461.439999999999s)]
*  on a Victrola somehow, you're retro. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8463.32s)]
*  You're listening to that record in four dimensions, [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8467.72s)]
*  but it's a 14-dimensional record. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8471.32s)]
*  So you and I are playing back [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8473.24s)]
*  a 14-dimensional quantum world, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8475.48s)]
*  but we're only playing back slices of it. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8478.199999999999s)]
*  So the illusion is that we're having [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8480.199999999999s)]
*  a four-dimensional conversation [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8481.519999999999s)]
*  because the Victrola part, that phone, his master's voice, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8482.96s)]
*  is the four-dimensional thing. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8487.439999999999s)]
*  And what's the stylus? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8488.759999999998s)]
*  It's the metric. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8490.439999999999s)]
*  It's gravity. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8492.039999999999s)]
*  The stylus is pulling off different data [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8493.48s)]
*  that is simultaneously existing. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8496.88s)]
*  So it's like the record is the multiverse, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8498.839999999998s)]
*  but you don't think of it in these terms. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8500.88s)]
*  You don't freak out and say, [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8502.439999999999s)]
*  oh my God, I'm holding the multiverse [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8503.759999999998s)]
*  because Light My Fire is somewhat adjacent to Soul Kitchen. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8505.359999999999s)]
*  That is my structure. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8510.64s)]
*  That's what I believe is true. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8513.519999999999s)]
*  And we're having the discussion [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8515.199999999999s)]
*  is if it's only the phonograph, the Victrola part. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8516.279999999999s)]
*  If you could then go to the record, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8523.119999999999s)]
*  you don't have to scratch your way back. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8525.439999999999s)]
*  You can do these weird moves [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8527.64s)]
*  where you can alight the stylus in different places [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8529.56s)]
*  and shrink things and grow things [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8532.439999999999s)]
*  and change the angles and all this stuff. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8534.68s)]
*  And you have engineering possibilities. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8537.72s)]
*  Like I will say what I believe [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8539.68s)]
*  the internal properties of the particles [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8542.800000000001s)]
*  that we have yet to find, the dark matter, if you will, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8545.68s)]
*  are. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8549.28s)]
*  I will tell you places that I believe [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8550.12s)]
*  the standard model is wrong. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8551.28s)]
*  And I'm happy to go down on the ship [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8552.48s)]
*  and move on with my life if I'm wrong. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8553.960000000001s)]
*  But I can't, I've been 40 years trying [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8556.76s)]
*  to have this conversation with a competent person. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8558.48s)]
*  And every excuse under the sun is used [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8561.800000000001s)]
*  to avoid talking about what I'm saying. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8564.44s)]
*  And I'll say some stuff that [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8567.44s)]
*  when I, 1987 around, I proposed a set of equations [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8571.6s)]
*  that were like the junior version of geometric unity. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8576.08s)]
*  I was told that those equations [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8580.720000000001s)]
*  were insufficiently nonlinear, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8582.16s)]
*  that they involve spinners and spinners [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8584.84s)]
*  have nothing to do with something called self-duality, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8587.4s)]
*  that I'd violated the spin statistics there. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8590.04s)]
*  And I did a whole bunch of things. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8594.800000000001s)]
*  And I was invited to leave Harvard, [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8596.640000000001s)]
*  where they said, you have to move out of Massachusetts. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8599.04s)]
*  You cannot live in Massachusetts. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8602.2s)]
*  And I said, you don't have the right to tell me [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8603.92s)]
*  where I come from, that's not part of our agreement. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8606.04s)]
*  They said, well, if you want to continue in this department, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8611.160000000002s)]
*  you have to move out of Massachusetts. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8613.36s)]
*  I only- [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8615.560000000001s)]
*  What was the reasoning behind that? [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8616.400000000001s)]
*  They thought I was wrong and crazy. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8619.36s)]
*  So, but- [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8622.08s)]
*  Let me keep, okay. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8622.92s)]
*  In 1994, Ed Witten is giving a lecture [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8625.84s)]
*  in the main seminar room in building two [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8632.72s)]
*  in the MIT math department, [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8634.88s)]
*  where I am now a postdoc [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8636.16s)]
*  under a National Science Foundation fellowship. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8638.04s)]
*  So I had gone through huge trouble [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8640.44s)]
*  and I crawled back on top. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8642.56s)]
*  And Ed Witten says, the self-duality revolution, [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8646.24s)]
*  which is related to Jim Simon's work, [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8649.4s)]
*  which I was saying before, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8652.12s)]
*  he says, theoretically, you don't have to deal [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8654.320000000002s)]
*  with these super complicated equations anymore. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8656.160000000002s)]
*  He doesn't say what replaces them. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8658.92s)]
*  And a guy named, I think, Alan Knudsen, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8661.400000000001s)]
*  who's now at Cornell, I think raises his hand like a punk. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8664.0s)]
*  And he says, do you want to tell us [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8667.960000000001s)]
*  what equations we would use instead? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8670.04s)]
*  And Ed Witten writes down these two sets, [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8672.52s)]
*  these set of two equations. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8674.84s)]
*  And I look at them and I say, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8677.76s)]
*  those are the equations that I proposed at Harvard [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8679.6s)]
*  in like five years ago or seven years ago. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8682.68s)]
*  And I said, huh, that's really interesting. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8687.12s)]
*  He's about to get told that they're insufficiently nonlinear, [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8689.4s)]
*  that they involve spinners, [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8692.720000000001s)]
*  which can't possibly involve self-duality, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8693.800000000001s)]
*  and that he's violated spin statistics. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8696.0s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to watching what happens [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8697.800000000001s)]
*  when Ed Witten is told this. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8700.4s)]
*  Couple of weeks later, [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8703.36s)]
*  I'm at the MIT commissary with Is Singer [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8705.16s)]
*  and the math physics group, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8708.8s)]
*  and a guy named Andras Senes, Hungarian brilliant guy, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8711.4s)]
*  now in Geneva, I think, says, have you heard the news? [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8715.64s)]
*  He comes by, he says, what news? [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8718.439999999999s)]
*  All of Donaldson theory and self-dual equations is falling. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8721.16s)]
*  He's like, what? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8725.72s)]
*  He's like, they were using the wrong equations. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8726.96s)]
*  Everything has become trivially easy. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8729.679999999998s)]
*  Can you bring up an article called [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8733.359999999999s)]
*  Gauge Theory is Dead, Long Live Gauge Theory? [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8734.8s)]
*  So, like, I didn't wanna tell these stories the last time. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8739.439999999999s)]
*  This is like super painful, but I'm done with this stuff. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8744.08s)]
*  I'm just completely done with this. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8746.599999999999s)]
*  So, you see, there was this thing called [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8749.08s)]
*  the self-dual equations, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8752.119999999999s)]
*  which Isadora Singer brought to Michael Atiyah [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8754.64s)]
*  and Nigel Hitchin. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8759.759999999998s)]
*  Oh, the other one was, if spinners were involved, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8761.24s)]
*  Nigel Hitchin would know, and he would have told us, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8764.199999999999s)]
*  which is bullshit. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8765.96s)]
*  Keep going to the next page. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8767.04s)]
*  The new gauge theory, you see those two equations, [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8770.320000000002s)]
*  D, A of phi equals zero. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8772.12s)]
*  I had written psi rather than phi. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8774.240000000002s)]
*  Phi has to do with the spin of the field. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8776.2s)]
*  But F, A plus equals I. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8779.92s)]
*  I had written these things down [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8782.720000000001s)]
*  in a slightly different form [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8783.92s)]
*  and had been effectively laughed out of Harvard for this. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8785.160000000002s)]
*  And it turns out that what was going on was [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8789.44s)]
*  Ed Witten had written these things down, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8794.400000000001s)]
*  and now all of these people were converted. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8796.400000000001s)]
*  And a lecture is given at room 507 [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8800.32s)]
*  in the Harvard math department on the fifth floor [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8802.84s)]
*  across from the office of a guy named Raoul Bott, [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8805.12s)]
*  who is absolutely not my advisor, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8807.28s)]
*  but the internet is determined to make him my advisor. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8809.12s)]
*  It's making me really upset. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8811.640000000001s)]
*  Raoul Bott is my hero, but he was not my advisor. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8813.6s)]
*  He's a great man, and you shouldn't do that to him, [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8817.36s)]
*  and you shouldn't do that to me. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8819.92s)]
*  So I go to this lecture, and the person giving it [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8822.640000000001s)]
*  was really the closest thing I had to an advisor, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8825.96s)]
*  if it's not a guy named Dror Barnatan, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8829.119999999999s)]
*  is the brother of somebody you've had on your program. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8831.4s)]
*  You've had Gary Taubes on your program. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8834.16s)]
*  His brother is named Clifford Taubes. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8836.919999999998s)]
*  And Clifford Taubes had picked a fight with Princeton, [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8840.08s)]
*  and he had said, you know, these guys at Princeton, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8845.96s)]
*  we work our asses off to get these results [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8847.96s)]
*  in Donaldson theory. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8849.96s)]
*  These equations are so hard, [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8851.919999999998s)]
*  and then always after the fact, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8853.279999999999s)]
*  Princeton tells us what we're really doing. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8854.56s)]
*  Thanks, guy. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8856.96s)]
*  So it was a fight between Cambridge and Princeton. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8857.8s)]
*  And now he's got to eat crow, okay? [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8861.359999999999s)]
*  So he's giving this lecture, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8865.08s)]
*  and he titles it Witten's Magical Equations. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8866.119999999999s)]
*  This is the same guy who tells me [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8868.88s)]
*  that I can't live in Massachusetts in 1987. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8870.199999999999s)]
*  And he's going on, he's like saying, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8877.0s)]
*  this is the greatest day of my life. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8878.56s)]
*  I was in prison, I was working at hard labor for 10 years. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8879.96s)]
*  These equations make everything trivially easy. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8883.6s)]
*  I am sitting in the back row of room 507 picking my nose. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8886.0s)]
*  And a guy in the front seat, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8890.08s)]
*  right hand side is named David Kajdan, [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8891.12s)]
*  one of the most brilliant people on the planet. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8892.880000000001s)]
*  And he usually falls asleep during the lecture. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8895.4s)]
*  He's like a Soviet Jew who got through [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8897.52s)]
*  the anti-Semitic system at Moscow State, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8899.24s)]
*  like unbelievable mind. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8901.24s)]
*  And he says, excuse me, Cliff, [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8903.16s)]
*  didn't we have a student at some point [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8905.44s)]
*  who told us to look at the spinner bundles [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8907.68s)]
*  and maybe these equations? [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8910.12s)]
*  And Cliff goes white as a ghost. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8912.16s)]
*  And I'm picking my nose, right nostril, [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8913.64s)]
*  and the entire room swivels and looks at me. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8916.08s)]
*  And then I realized like everybody actually remembers [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8918.64s)]
*  what I was saying and my thesis is on the spinner bundles, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8921.64s)]
*  all this stuff. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8924.039999999999s)]
*  And I have this question, do I tell them the whole theory? [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8926.92s)]
*  And I left mathematics at that moment. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8931.36s)]
*  I just decided, I can't trust you people. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8934.96s)]
*  Cliff knows the answer. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8938.52s)]
*  Cliff is supposed to say, you know, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8939.6s)]
*  Eric told me to look at that. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8941.44s)]
*  And he won't do it. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8944.4s)]
*  He's sitting there giving the credit, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8945.36s)]
*  not even to Syberg and Witten, [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8946.76s)]
*  who are the two people who do these equations. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8948.2s)]
*  He's giving a whole thing to Witten [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8949.92s)]
*  because he's scared, because he's apologizing. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8951.480000000001s)]
*  He's saying, I screwed up. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8954.44s)]
*  I doubted you, Princeton. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8955.92s)]
*  Princeton was right, Harvard was wrong. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8957.44s)]
*  New Jersey beats Massachusetts. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8959.960000000001s)]
*  Tough shit, that's the way it goes. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8961.84s)]
*  But Massachusetts actually had an entrant in that game [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8964.08s)]
*  and that was me. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8967.4s)]
*  And then Isidore Singer writes somewhere [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8969.24s)]
*  in one of his papers, you know, [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8972.039999999999s)]
*  I learned about this years ago before from Eric Weinstein, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8973.199999999999s)]
*  a paper with Kano and Ballou. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8978.64s)]
*  So this was my trajectory. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8983.52s)]
*  This is why I left mathematics in part, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8984.88s)]
*  because I realized that there was just no honor. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8986.96s)]
*  There was no way of making a name. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8988.8s)]
*  Like people are just gonna give away my stuff. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8994.039999999999s)]
*  So when I did this draft of GU, I said, I'm an entertainer. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=8995.92s)]
*  People don't have any clue why. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9000.16s)]
*  It's because I have copyright protection. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9001.92s)]
*  If I release a work of entertainment, [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9004.039999999999s)]
*  you can't just name it after yourself or your friend [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9006.119999999999s)]
*  or whoever you're upset with, you know, that might hurt you. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9009.0s)]
*  It's like, that's mine. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9012.119999999999s)]
*  It's my work of entertainment. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9013.16s)]
*  I own the Portal podcast, tough shit. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9014.4s)]
*  Now all that is long in the past. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9020.16s)]
*  I don't want the Syberg-Witten equations, [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9022.599999999999s)]
*  which is what they're now called. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9024.599999999999s)]
*  Natty Syberg and I have worked this out years ago [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9026.72s)]
*  at a meeting in San Francisco. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9028.199999999999s)]
*  He got $3 million. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9030.64s)]
*  I forced him to give me a hug in front of the Institute [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9031.92s)]
*  for Advanced Study, call it even. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9034.039999999999s)]
*  This is so much bigger than this. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9036.8s)]
*  Those things, the Syberg-Witten equations [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9038.88s)]
*  is the barest thumbnail of what's coming. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9041.279999999999s)]
*  And if we don't use this stuff, [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9045.92s)]
*  we're doomed here with Xi and Biden and Kamala [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9050.72s)]
*  and Trump and Putin and Zelensky and Khomeini [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9054.560000000001s)]
*  and all of these idiots. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9059.16s)]
*  We're not gonna make it. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9062.36s)]
*  What I work on, where I've disappeared, [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9065.48s)]
*  where's the Portal? [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9067.76s)]
*  We've loaded the Portal, you know, it's like, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9068.720000000001s)]
*  do you notice how everything that you love gets destroyed? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9071.84s)]
*  Jordan Peterson, Bret Weinstein, Sam Harris, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9074.800000000001s)]
*  even Lex Friedman, they go after Lex Friedman. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9078.2s)]
*  After I warn Lex, they're gonna come for you [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9080.16s)]
*  because of his reading list [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9082.0s)]
*  and because they misportray him [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9083.16s)]
*  as if he's claiming to be an MIT professor, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9085.28s)]
*  which he's never claimed in his life. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9087.4s)]
*  They destroy all of us if we don't sing from the hymnal. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9091.32s)]
*  This is so important to me because it's hope. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9095.24s)]
*  If I'm wrong, then maybe we don't have a way off this planet. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9098.08s)]
*  Maybe we don't have a way to the solar system, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9101.48s)]
*  out of the solar system. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9103.36s)]
*  That's bad news. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9105.0s)]
*  What would be the technology that would harness this? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9107.4s)]
*  You would figure out how to do the stuff on the record, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9112.96s)]
*  rather than the phonograph, the Victrola. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9117.039999999999s)]
*  You would start to move the space-time metric, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9120.0s)]
*  you would move along the directions of the metric, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9123.24s)]
*  not using the Einstein field equations. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9125.24s)]
*  So you would try to figure out, okay, [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9128.56s)]
*  if we're in flatland here, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9130.599999999999s)]
*  a four-dimensional slice of a 14-dimensional world, [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9132.199999999999s)]
*  how do I go what we, I have to say it in my own language, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9135.919999999998s)]
*  along the 10-dimensional normal bundle? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9139.119999999999s)]
*  14 equals four dimensions we know plus 10 we don't. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9141.2s)]
*  Call the 10 we don't the normal bundle. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9144.04s)]
*  You'd start navigating in the normal bundle. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9146.28s)]
*  You'd stop thinking about this sound [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9148.400000000001s)]
*  coming out of the Victrola, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9150.84s)]
*  you'd say that's three components. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9151.880000000001s)]
*  There's a stylus, there's a horn, and there's a record. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9153.76s)]
*  And you'd engineer around that [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9158.0s)]
*  so that you had a really efficient way to go very far, [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9160.16s)]
*  or to circle back in time without going back through time. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9163.92s)]
*  You'd try to figure out, what can I do with the stylus? [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9166.880000000001s)]
*  Where can I put the stylus on the record to get different? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9170.08s)]
*  And what technology would you employ to do that? [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9172.8s)]
*  Well, so first of all, [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9176.56s)]
*  we know about three families of matter. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9178.44s)]
*  Like this is made, everything you see around you [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9181.36s)]
*  is made of the first family of matter. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9183.44s)]
*  It's all up quarks, down quarks, electrons, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9185.039999999999s)]
*  and you and I are being penetrated [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9187.16s)]
*  as much as that's very distasteful by neutrinos. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9188.76s)]
*  That's the first family of matter, okay? [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9192.12s)]
*  Then there's a second family, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9194.52s)]
*  where the up and down quarks [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9195.76s)]
*  are replaced by charm and strange, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9197.28s)]
*  the neutrino is replaced by the muon, [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9198.68s)]
*  neutrino of the electron is replaced by the muon. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9200.56s)]
*  And then there's a third one, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9203.12s)]
*  where the muon is replaced by the tau, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9204.24s)]
*  top, bottom, and tau neutrinos, okay? [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9206.64s)]
*  If I'm correct, there are two additional [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9211.2s)]
*  generations of matter that are not, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9216.24s)]
*  or families of matter that are not generations. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9218.4s)]
*  They don't have the same structure [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9220.52s)]
*  as the ones we already know. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9221.76s)]
*  Some of them are something called spin three halves, [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9224.0s)]
*  and some of them are exotic spin one half matter. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9226.28s)]
*  So first of all, if you have dark matter [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9229.08s)]
*  that you have no idea of, you can't do dark chemistry. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9230.640000000001s)]
*  But if you do have an idea, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9233.92s)]
*  then you can guess at what dark chemistry would be, [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9235.800000000001s)]
*  and you'll have dark light. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9238.04s)]
*  Everything you see here is spun left-handed [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9241.52s)]
*  if it's matter and spun right-handed if it's antimatter. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9245.480000000001s)]
*  My claim is we are decoupled from matter that spins right [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9249.720000000001s)]
*  and antimatter that spins left. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9254.56s)]
*  But in a low gravitational environment, [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9256.48s)]
*  it's like my left and my right hand don't know each other. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9259.84s)]
*  So you have the asymmetry of a hand, [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9262.56s)]
*  which is you say, oh, digits two and four [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9265.8s)]
*  look like each other. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9268.64s)]
*  The middle finger is the axis of symmetry. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9270.119999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, the pinky and the thumb [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9272.56s)]
*  look wildly different, but let's fudge it [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9274.6s)]
*  and imagine that there's a symmetry. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9276.4s)]
*  Suddenly, you realize neurologically you're disconnected, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9278.4s)]
*  and it's thumb to thumb on a different hand [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9281.6s)]
*  that you didn't know anything about. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9283.56s)]
*  So my claim is I believe that this world that appears [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9285.6s)]
*  to have a left-handed or right-handed nature, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9288.32s)]
*  like Cindy Crawford has a beauty mark [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9290.84s)]
*  so you know whether a photo is of her or her mirror image. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9292.519999999999s)]
*  There's like another Cindy Crawford [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9297.08s)]
*  with the beauty mark on the other side. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9299.119999999999s)]
*  Sorry, I'm dating myself, people. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9303.359999999999s)]
*  But that world would have engineering possibilities [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9305.08s)]
*  to do dark chemistry. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9308.76s)]
*  We would have additional forces. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9311.04s)]
*  Normally, we get additional forces [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9314.28s)]
*  through something called grand unification, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9315.84s)]
*  where we use theories called SU5 and spin 10 or SO10. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9318.080000000002s)]
*  And those are the wrong flavors of the right idea. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9322.880000000001s)]
*  The right flavor would be called spin six comma four, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9325.160000000002s)]
*  and SU5 would be replaced by SU3 comma two. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9328.28s)]
*  So there would be new unifications, new forces, [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9332.080000000002s)]
*  it would produce new problems, [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9335.240000000002s)]
*  because when you put that commas, you know, three comma two, [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9336.92s)]
*  you create something that is more space-timey [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9340.68s)]
*  than particle physics. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9342.96s)]
*  So there's stuff we don't know how to deal with. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9344.8s)]
*  But you see, there's nothing in the laws of physics [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9347.4s)]
*  that say the rules of the universe [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9349.279999999999s)]
*  will conform to what particle theorists [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9353.64s)]
*  currently know how to handle. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9355.96s)]
*  Nature seems to know things we don't know how to do, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9357.76s)]
*  and the time has ended for us to tell nature, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9360.72s)]
*  you can't have this or you must have that [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9363.88s)]
*  because we don't know how to handle you otherwise. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9365.8s)]
*  Tough luck. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9367.56s)]
*  It's the forces are different, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9368.8s)]
*  the opportunities are different. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9370.72s)]
*  Something called the Petit-Salam theory [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9372.279999999999s)]
*  of grand unification is tied to the Einstein theory. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9375.8s)]
*  And what I wanna do is to say, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9379.199999999999s)]
*  can I get people, lawyers, guns and money [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9381.759999999998s)]
*  to investigate this so that we can go traverse the cosmos? [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9386.0s)]
*  I don't know how to do the engineering [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9389.08s)]
*  any more than the person who invented the neutron, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9390.64s)]
*  it was Chadwick who was the one who found it. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9393.8s)]
*  He wasn't Lise Meitner who figured out the chain reaction [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9396.199999999999s)]
*  and she wasn't Enrico Fermi who figured out [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9398.759999999998s)]
*  how to do it experimentally. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9401.96s)]
*  That wasn't Trinity, which was the Manhattan Project [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9403.84s)]
*  and they weren't Teller and Ulam. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9406.039999999999s)]
*  So it's not on Eric to figure out [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9407.279999999999s)]
*  how to do the engineering project. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9409.64s)]
*  I need people. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9411.16s)]
*  What could you imagine would be involved [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9412.72s)]
*  in figuring out a way to harness that, [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9418.359999999999s)]
*  like and actually utilize it [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9420.32s)]
*  and actually go inter-dimensionally? [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9422.4s)]
*  Like what would you have to do? [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9425.279999999999s)]
*  What kind of power would have to be generated? [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9428.4s)]
*  Like what would be involved? [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9431.119999999999s)]
*  So what wouldn't be involved is getting an entire planet [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9433.16s)]
*  to put a tiny dent in space time [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9436.92s)]
*  because that's not gonna work. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9439.68s)]
*  It would be a question of saying, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9441.4s)]
*  I know about more degrees of freedom. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9443.359999999999s)]
*  Are those degrees of freedom accessible? [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9445.88s)]
*  And to give you an idea of what's involved, [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9447.8s)]
*  if you take a proton with two up quarks and a down quark, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9450.72s)]
*  so put two U's and a D inside of a ball, [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9453.4s)]
*  you call it proton. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9455.599999999999s)]
*  You're tempted to say, [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9457.119999999999s)]
*  okay, if those are hard little balls inside, [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9458.119999999999s)]
*  I wanna pull one out. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9459.72s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9461.92s)]
*  The equations have something that used to be called [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9463.56s)]
*  inferred slavery, but we're not allowed to say the word [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9465.96s)]
*  slavery because of diversity equity included. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9468.48s)]
*  I'm gonna say slavery because I'm here. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9470.519999999999s)]
*  You cannot pull a quark out of a proton. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9473.08s)]
*  So what looks like a degree of freedom [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9476.16s)]
*  is not accessible to you. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9479.04s)]
*  In the equations, you see up quarks and down quarks. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9480.68s)]
*  You don't see protons and neutrons, [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9483.320000000002s)]
*  but the consequence of the equations [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9485.28s)]
*  is protons and neutrons, right? [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9488.560000000001s)]
*  So when you look at the equations, [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9491.160000000002s)]
*  you can't tell is that accessible or inaccessible. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9493.04s)]
*  To bring it back to the UFO point, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9496.640000000001s)]
*  the reason UFOs matter to me is if they're here, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9499.36s)]
*  then these degrees of freedom are accessible. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9502.28s)]
*  And if they're not here, [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9504.68s)]
*  then it's probably like protons being filled [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9505.960000000001s)]
*  with up quarks and down quarks that we can't engineer. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9509.4s)]
*  The consequences of quark structure inside of the atom [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9511.84s)]
*  industrially are zero. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9515.72s)]
*  We've been at this since you're born when it's 67. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9518.96s)]
*  The year after you're born, we find quarks. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9522.439999999999s)]
*  We have zero industrial applications, right? [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9524.439999999999s)]
*  That means you have to think about both possibilities. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9529.599999999999s)]
*  One, that these things are actionable if they're right. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9533.039999999999s)]
*  So first of all, Eric can be wrong, [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9535.8s)]
*  and I'm happy to be wrong if I'm wrong, [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9537.56s)]
*  or I can be right. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9540.039999999999s)]
*  If I'm right, then it splits into a second level [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9541.199999999999s)]
*  of the decision tree. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9544.48s)]
*  Maybe the new degrees of freedom are things [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9545.6s)]
*  we can play with at the engineering level, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9547.279999999999s)]
*  and maybe they're inaccessible just the way we can't play [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9549.039999999999s)]
*  with up quarks and down quarks directly. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9551.32s)]
*  If we can play with it, then we've got so many new toys, [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9554.92s)]
*  you have no idea. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9558.519999999999s)]
*  New forces, new matter, new possibilities to flit in [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9559.72s)]
*  and out between dark and light matter. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9563.92s)]
*  But from an engineering perspective, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9566.0s)]
*  how would you make any of this happen? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9568.04s)]
*  You would build something based on new plans [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9571.84s)]
*  that did something that nothing else could do. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9576.68s)]
*  So to give an example, in the late 50s, [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9578.88s)]
*  we thought we knew electromagnetism cold. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9581.32s)]
*  We'd been playing with it since Maxwell's time, right? [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9583.96s)]
*  Two guys named Aronoff and Bohm said, [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9588.0s)]
*  "'Here's a crazy experiment. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9590.8s)]
*  Take a tube that's perfectly insulated almost [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9593.279999999999s)]
*  and run current through it, [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9597.199999999999s)]
*  and then pass an electron beam from like a cathode ray tube [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9598.56s)]
*  and reflect it off mirrors and see when it comes back [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9602.88s)]
*  and interferes with itself, how it interferes. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9605.64s)]
*  If it's perfectly insulated, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9609.72s)]
*  it shouldn't be able to tell whether there's current [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9613.119999999999s)]
*  running through the center of the solenoid, of that tube. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9615.279999999999s)]
*  Turns out when you turn on the tube [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9620.64s)]
*  and you run current through it, [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9623.04s)]
*  the electron beam can detect [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9624.84s)]
*  whether there's current running through it through magic. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9627.0s)]
*  Technically, magic here means something called holonomy. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9630.52s)]
*  We didn't know that the electromagnetic fields [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9633.960000000001s)]
*  are not where electromagnetism really happens. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9637.52s)]
*  It's something called the electromagnetic potential. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9641.0s)]
*  It's a precursor that actually determines the universe. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9643.28s)]
*  It determines the electromagnetic fields, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9646.36s)]
*  but this weird thing where somehow the current inside [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9649.119999999999s)]
*  a perfectly insulated tube is influencing the world [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9652.199999999999s)]
*  outside of it was like holy smokes. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9654.92s)]
*  We've been living with this stuff for how long. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9658.48s)]
*  We had no idea how it works. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9660.24s)]
*  The way you do this is we get together with a bunch of people [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9662.32s)]
*  and we'd say, if Eric is correct, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9665.199999999999s)]
*  or if somebody else is correct, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9667.72s)]
*  and you started to play with this extended model [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9670.599999999999s)]
*  of both general relativity and the standard model, [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9675.039999999999s)]
*  what are some experiments we could run [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9678.56s)]
*  that you think would have no actual content [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9681.24s)]
*  just the way the Aronoff-Bohm experiment [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9683.720000000001s)]
*  looks like it's not gonna do anything? [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9685.720000000001s)]
*  Or the Casimir effect, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9688.16s)]
*  or finding out that beta decay, radioactive decay, [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9690.0s)]
*  knows its left from its right. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9694.36s)]
*  These are all hugely surprising discoveries. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9695.76s)]
*  I don't know how to do that, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9699.16s)]
*  and it's one of the reasons I keep talking to Brian Keating, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9701.2s)]
*  who's an experimentalist, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9703.6s)]
*  because what you see here in the studio [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9704.88s)]
*  is 100% theorists. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9708.16s)]
*  You only invite theorists from physics. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9709.92s)]
*  You don't invite experimentalists. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9711.679999999998s)]
*  I don't know how to talk to the experimentalists, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9714.039999999999s)]
*  but that's why I go down [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9715.92s)]
*  to the University of California San Diego [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9716.759999999998s)]
*  and play down there, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9719.039999999999s)]
*  because I wanna talk to people who are like, [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9720.279999999999s)]
*  how do we build this? [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9721.96s)]
*  You're the engineers of physics. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9723.199999999999s)]
*  Tell me what I'm saying in terms [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9725.839999999998s)]
*  that we can build something [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9728.839999999998s)]
*  and actually see if it has consequences. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9730.56s)]
*  What could it be in terms of building something? [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9732.08s)]
*  Imagine, for example, [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9735.12s)]
*  that you look at the equivalence principle. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9736.44s)]
*  The equivalence principle says that the inertial mass, [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9740.84s)]
*  how much mass something appears to have [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9743.12s)]
*  when it's moving, how resistant it is to force, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9745.72s)]
*  that's the same, according to Einstein, [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9749.4s)]
*  as the gravitational force, the gravitational mass. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9751.24s)]
*  Gravitational mass equals inertial mass. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9754.56s)]
*  There are a whole bunch of different flavors of mass [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9756.84s)]
*  that happen to all be equal [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9760.04s)]
*  according to different principles. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9761.480000000001s)]
*  According to something called spontaneous symmetry breaking, [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9764.68s)]
*  mass is generated by the interaction [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9770.320000000002s)]
*  with the Higgs field in general. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9772.76s)]
*  It's not a number the way we thought it was [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9775.2s)]
*  coded into an equation. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9777.2s)]
*  It's something we would call a vacuum expectation value [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9778.800000000001s)]
*  through a Yukawa coupling, nevermind. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9781.480000000001s)]
*  It's that thing about the molasses [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9783.800000000001s)]
*  causes the mass to feel heavier, [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9785.44s)]
*  even though the mass of the cup hasn't changed [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9788.72s)]
*  because it's requiring more and more force to push. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9790.56s)]
*  If what we have is a bunch of different kinds of mass, [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9796.4s)]
*  we might be able to break some of these things [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9799.279999999999s)]
*  like the equivalence principle. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9801.439999999999s)]
*  We might be able to generate negative mass, [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9803.039999999999s)]
*  which is not technically excluded, [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9806.439999999999s)]
*  but is incredibly hard to think about. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9809.4s)]
*  We might be able to do things, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9811.92s)]
*  the only way we keep mass always positive [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9813.72s)]
*  is by putting in artificial conditions. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9816.4s)]
*  If you have a bigger theory, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9819.08s)]
*  you start to realize how you would do these things naturally. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9820.44s)]
*  So for example, we might be able to dial the mass [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9824.44s)]
*  of things differently by actually engineering [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9827.199999999999s)]
*  the thing that we call the Higgs field. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9830.52s)]
*  The Higgs field is the only thing that doesn't spin [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9834.24s)]
*  that is fundamental when we spin space time. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9838.08s)]
*  And they've detected the Higgs boson [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9840.8s)]
*  on a large Hadron Collider, right? [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9842.88s)]
*  100%, 2012 I think. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9845.800000000001s)]
*  So, but this is an enormous collider, right? [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9848.04s)]
*  I mean, to be able to generate the Higgs, [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9852.4s)]
*  it had to go through how many kilometers [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9856.48s)]
*  and it's an enormous piece of equipment, right? [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9858.4s)]
*  But that's in part because it's a stupid piece of equipment. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9862.48s)]
*  What we're really doing is banging rocks together, [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9865.72s)]
*  except the rocks are called protons. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9867.92s)]
*  So you're thinking there could be an engineering solution [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9870.12s)]
*  where you could generate something like that, [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9873.72s)]
*  but from a much smaller footprint. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9876.76s)]
*  100% that's a possibility, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9879.4s)]
*  because right now what we're doing [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9881.4s)]
*  is we're using electromagnetism only. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9882.76s)]
*  The only force that we actually have engineering power over [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9884.679999999998s)]
*  is electromagnetism. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9888.32s)]
*  Like when we do chemistry, so you fertilize your lawn, [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9890.76s)]
*  you're using electron orbitals based on electromagnetism [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9894.119999999999s)]
*  between the proton and the electron in an atom or molecule. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9897.279999999999s)]
*  We don't know how to interfere with the weak force [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9901.720000000001s)]
*  or the gravitational force. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9904.2s)]
*  Both of those are so weak that they're impossible. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9906.08s)]
*  And the strong force is crazily nuclear [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9907.84s)]
*  and super short range. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9910.36s)]
*  So we've got control of one out of four forces. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9911.92s)]
*  I can tell you what I believe the additional forces are, [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9915.92s)]
*  but what I need is I need people who are closer [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9919.16s)]
*  to engineering, experiment and standard theory. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9921.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm not even a physicist, Joe, so I. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9924.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9927.08s)]
*  What I'm curious about is like, [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9927.92s)]
*  what caused this shift in you to think about UFOs [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9930.0s)]
*  and UFO reports as being credible? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9934.119999999999s)]
*  Because we're talking theoretically [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9937.4s)]
*  and you're talking about your understanding of dimensions. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9939.839999999998s)]
*  Because I thought it was not, [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9941.919999999998s)]
*  I thought it was a smoke screen that we were using [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9943.8s)]
*  to do aerospace engineering projects. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9945.96s)]
*  I thought it was like Operation Fortitude [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9948.359999999999s)]

*  And so it's like, okay, please don't bother me [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9952.279999999999s)]
*  with your sci-fi stories. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9954.439999999999s)]
*  It's space opera. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9956.88s)]
*  For the same reason that I don't go into a Scientology [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9957.92s)]
*  center and spend all my time thinking about Xenu, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9960.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna spend all my time worried about space opera. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9962.92s)]
*  And what changed? [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9965.48s)]
*  Meeting an enormous number of very sober, [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9968.28s)]
*  very grown up people who seem to be changed, [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9970.92s)]
*  alter and believe that this is real. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9974.72s)]
*  I have met an enormous number of people now [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9978.0s)]
*  who had personal firsthand, like sober people [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9981.68s)]
*  who've had crazy firsthand encounters. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9986.12s)]
*  I don't understand how they're doing this as actors. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9988.6s)]
*  Very often it's unwanted, it ruins their lives. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9991.24s)]
*  It's sad. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9994.72s)]
*  You know, I ended up in San Marino [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9996.12s)]
*  at Lou Elizondo's invitation and then Lou couldn't come [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=9998.4s)]
*  so I ended up speaking in Lou's place at a UFO. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10001.12s)]
*  I mean, it was crazy. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10003.52s)]
*  But I met so many people who were just like, [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10005.0s)]
*  Eric, you know, let me explain my experience to you. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10007.2s)]
*  And I'm just not prepared for these highly detailed stories [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10010.08s)]
*  that have so much similarity, one to the next. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10014.32s)]
*  You know, like the Skinwalker Ranch thing [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10017.84s)]
*  on the History Channel looks incredibly junky [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10019.48s)]
*  put out by Prometheus Entertainment. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10023.199999999999s)]
*  I know Brandon Fugel, the owner of the ranch. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10025.8s)]
*  And I know Eric Bard, we keep talking via phone. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10029.36s)]
*  Eric Bard is like almost the only other person [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10035.08s)]
*  who has some idea of what differential forms are, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10037.72s)]
*  tensor analysis. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10039.64s)]
*  He's a sober, normal human being sitting out there [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10041.0s)]
*  on a ranch trying to figure out [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10044.88s)]
*  what the hell he's looking at. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10046.96s)]
*  I don't think he's lying to me. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10048.48s)]
*  And I don't think Brandon is lying to me. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10051.48s)]
*  And then you hear their stories, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10054.12s)]
*  like the Gary Nolan thing, I was completely unprepared. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10055.36s)]
*  Have you dealt with Gary? [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10057.88s)]
*  No, I watched him on Lex though. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10058.8s)]
*  I think Gary told me a story where he was like [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10061.72s)]
*  dealing with a subject, he's a medical guy [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10063.96s)]
*  and that's how he got involved with this. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10065.92s)]
*  And you know, somehow the medical person that he is [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10067.8s)]
*  is talking to a subject who says, [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10070.8s)]
*  you know, I encountered a spinning disc in the sky [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10072.88s)]
*  or whatever and a ball of light comes in. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10075.08s)]
*  Oh brother, another one of these stories. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10077.039999999999s)]
*  He's like, you know, the ball of light entered my body [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10080.08s)]
*  and I was in pain, but it was okay. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10082.08s)]
*  And it exited and whatever. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10083.88s)]
*  And then Gary looks at the person [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10085.4s)]
*  and there's a path of necrosis [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10086.64s)]
*  exactly where the person describes [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10088.039999999999s)]
*  this thing exiting. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10090.759999999998s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10092.72s)]
*  Are you, like, tell me what the level of conspiracy is here. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10095.359999999999s)]
*  That would be necessary to get all of this indirect evidence. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10100.84s)]
*  And this is the basic puzzle of UFOs. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10103.84s)]
*  Zero responsible adult direct evidence in the public domain. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10106.279999999999s)]
*  Zero, so far as I can tell. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10110.599999999999s)]
*  More indirect evidence than you can possibly imagine [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10113.679999999998s)]
*  with sober normal people claiming things [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10117.759999999998s)]
*  that I can't believe firsthand stuff. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10120.759999999998s)]
*  And then it gets weirder and worse from that. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10124.8s)]
*  I would love to keep this just at metallic flying objects, [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10128.12s)]
*  but like, no, it's always gonna be like, [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10132.320000000002s)]
*  no, they go under the water and then, you know, [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10134.880000000001s)]
*  the next level is like cattle mutilation. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10138.68s)]
*  It's like, oh, please don't bring in cattle mutilation. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10140.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, the stapes, you know, [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10142.800000000001s)]
*  the smallest bone in the body, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10144.160000000002s)]
*  the three bones that make mammals mammals. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10145.640000000001s)]
*  You know, one of them seems to be frequently missing. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10148.720000000001s)]
*  And then like Paul Hellyer and Chaim Eshed [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10150.960000000001s)]
*  and Ben Rich. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10155.36s)]
*  Then there's this like crazy level [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10157.84s)]
*  where the former Canadian defense minister believes [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10159.480000000001s)]
*  that there's a galactic federation, [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10163.28s)]
*  the humans are in contact and they is head [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10164.84s)]
*  of the Israeli space. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10166.84s)]
*  It's like enough, I can't handle it. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10167.68s)]
*  I don't know what we're looking at. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10170.880000000001s)]
*  And I'd love to keep it at something sober. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10172.880000000001s)]
*  And I see zero direct evidence. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10175.36s)]
*  And if we're gonna go on the direct evidence, [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10177.16s)]
*  Elon is right, it's bullshit. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10178.720000000001s)]
*  Tough luck. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10181.32s)]
*  But I don't know how this amount [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10182.880000000001s)]
*  of indirect evidence occurs [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10184.16s)]
*  because I don't think the government is capable [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10186.84s)]
*  of faking this. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10188.48s)]
*  On the other hand, if we go by the indirect evidence, [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10189.96s)]
*  how is it that none of us have, [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10193.68s)]
*  like even the center of mass coordinates of this Tic Tac, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10195.92s)]
*  you'll never hear me talking about the Tic Tac [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10198.56s)]
*  or the Zimbabwe kids or whatever. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10200.8s)]
*  Why? [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10202.96s)]
*  Because since the mid seventies, [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10203.8s)]
*  we've been able to do CGI in Star Wars [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10204.8s)]
*  that looks much more realistic than any video I've ever seen. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10208.64s)]
*  So you can show me any video and I don't care. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10211.36s)]
*  It's just not interesting to me. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10214.6s)]
*  We don't have center of mass coordinates for this Tic Tac [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10216.68s)]
*  that's claimed by the US government over the Nimitz. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10218.960000000001s)]
*  Please. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10222.28s)]
*  Oh, because it's sensitive. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10223.880000000001s)]
*  We don't, stop it, shut up. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10224.960000000001s)]
*  Hush. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10227.400000000001s)]
*  So is it they don't have it? [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10228.24s)]
*  They won't release it? [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10229.400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, they claim it's not released. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10230.24s)]
*  It can't be released to the public. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10231.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10233.480000000001s)]
*  I'm like, so down sample it, de-res, [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10234.32s)]

*  You're claiming it's something you can't understand [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10239.0s)]
*  and you have the 3D coordinates [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10242.44s)]
*  and I can't play with it in a model [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10244.4s)]
*  on like Google Earth or SketchUp or something. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10246.2s)]
*  Go after yourselves. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10250.039999999999s)]
*  You're gonna stove pipe this need to know. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10252.0s)]
*  I have a need to know. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10253.92s)]

*  Take your pick. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10260.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10288.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10289.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10290.08s)]
*  And every time I asked her out, she's like, [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10290.92s)]
*  I really wanna go out with you, [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10292.28s)]
*  but I really have to wash my hair [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10293.400000000001s)]
*  or I really have to hang out with my hair. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10294.92s)]
*  This is not going very well. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10297.32s)]
*  At some point, somebody pulls me aside and said, [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10300.48s)]
*  Eric, you're Jewish, she's Mormon. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10302.4s)]
*  Get the hint. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10304.28s)]
*  She likes you. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10305.12s)]
*  But there was nothing gonna happen. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10307.36s)]
*  Okay, I get it. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10309.92s)]
*  This is Meredith Baker. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10311.2s)]
*  You don't want, for some reason, [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10312.2s)]
*  to tell me what's actually going on. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10313.84s)]
*  Then don't waste my time. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10315.64s)]
*  Don't spend my credibility. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10316.76s)]
*  Do you think that they don't wanna release the information [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10318.0s)]
*  because they're still trying to digest it themselves [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10321.52s)]
*  and they don't want it to get out publicly [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10323.56s)]
*  and get into the hands of- [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10325.32s)]
*  I'm not smart enough to figure this out. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10327.16s)]
*  I believe- [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10328.28s)]
*  If there was something that was beyond our understanding, [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10329.12s)]
*  you want that data to be released? [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10334.92s)]
*  Can we have a glass of something [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10337.16s)]
*  so that I can hide behind the fact [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10339.44s)]
*  that I had a sip of alcohol? [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10341.2s)]
*  All right, I'm gonna take a leak again [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10342.6s)]
*  and we'll come back with ice and alcohol for Eric. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10343.76s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10346.4s)]
*  Apparently he's a drunk. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10347.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10348.060000000001s)]
*  Cheers, sir. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10348.9s)]
*  Cheers. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10349.720000000001s)]
*  All right, now you got your excuse. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10350.560000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10351.640000000001s)]
*  Let's talk crazy. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10354.24s)]
*  All right. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10355.12s)]
*  That's good. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10356.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10358.560000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10359.4s)]
*  Glenn Morange. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10362.800000000001s)]
*  Morange? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10364.28s)]
*  Is that how you say it? [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10365.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10366.12s)]
*  How's it spelled? [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10366.960000000001s)]
*  I thought it was Morange. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10367.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10368.68s)]
*  How do you say it? [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10369.52s)]
*  Glenn Morange. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10370.36s)]
*  Glenn Morange? [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10371.800000000001s)]
*  I'd call it Morange, but I don't think that's right either. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10373.800000000001s)]
*  I think it's Morange. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10375.76s)]
*  Glenn Morange. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10376.92s)]
*  I thought it was Glenn Morange. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10378.880000000001s)]
*  So, where were we? [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10380.84s)]
*  You wanted to know what I think is really going on. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10382.36s)]
*  Yeah, what's really going on, then? [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10383.800000000001s)]
*  One possibility is we did a lot of bad stuff [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10386.12s)]
*  and we cannot get out of the fact [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10389.6s)]
*  that if we release what we actually know [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10391.56s)]
*  and what has been going on, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10394.039999999999s)]
*  there's gonna be a lot of consequence. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10395.2s)]
*  Bad stuff as in? [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10397.0s)]
*  Maybe people got killed. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10400.48s)]
*  Maybe people were made crazy when they weren't crazy [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10401.84s)]
*  because they saw things. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10405.16s)]
*  So, if you think about, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10406.44s)]
*  you know about deconfliction? [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10410.16s)]
*  Deconfliction. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10411.52s)]
*  Yeah. No. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10412.48s)]
*  If you have a blue on blue situation, [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10414.16s)]
*  that means that two official representatives [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10417.44s)]
*  of the US government are stumbling over each other. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10419.52s)]
*  You've got local law enforcement. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10422.08s)]
*  Like the first scene of The Matrix [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10423.320000000002s)]
*  is, you know, something got really fucking intimidating, Joe. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10427.04s)]
*  Now I'm scared. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10430.36s)]
*  Just ask him what it really is. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10434.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10436.480000000001s)]
*  Nicely done. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10439.28s)]
*  The US alerted Russia to Biden's Ukraine visit [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10440.12s)]
*  for deconfliction purposes. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10442.640000000001s)]
*  Wow. Jamie? [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10445.2s)]
*  So hey, don't blow up this city [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10446.04s)]
*  because Biden's gonna be there. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10448.28s)]
*  And there are three systems that stop [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10450.12s)]
*  the first scene in The Matrix [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10454.08s)]
*  where the agents show up and local law enforcement is like, [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10455.400000000001s)]
*  I think we can handle one little girl. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10458.480000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10460.68s)]
*  No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10461.52s)]
*  That's a deconfliction situation. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10464.2s)]
*  We have three things I think called [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10466.880000000001s)]
*  Case Explorer, RIS is safe and, [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10468.44s)]
*  oh God, safety net. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10476.08s)]
*  We don't know about these things [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10478.96s)]
*  because this is only for grownups in the government. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10480.48s)]
*  So they have to like file what it is that they're doing [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10483.92s)]
*  and then, oh, we've got an undercover agent [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10487.72s)]
*  who's posing as a Colombian drug lord. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10490.16s)]
*  Don't bust him. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10492.52s)]
*  Cause we've got like 10 years invested in this thing. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10493.6s)]
*  So I tried to use this system. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10496.4s)]
*  I called up, I think Case Explorer for South Florida [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10498.84s)]
*  and got into a half an hour. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10501.800000000001s)]
*  Okay, Case Explorer. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10504.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10505.800000000001s)]
*  I wonder how you found it. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10506.640000000001s)]
*  Try RIS is safe. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10507.480000000001s)]
*  I think that's the one. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10513.08s)]
*  I don't wanna keep looking up all these websites. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10513.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's gonna get in trouble. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10515.52s)]
*  Okay. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10516.560000000001s)]
*  But I'll do it, I'll do it. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10517.400000000001s)]
*  So this is how they deconflict blue on blue. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10520.240000000002s)]
*  But you see, you and I are also blue. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10523.880000000001s)]
*  We're having a conversation [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10525.52s)]
*  and we may be stumbling on something [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10526.68s)]
*  the government doesn't want us to know, [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10529.08s)]
*  which is what happened when COVID may be spilled out. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10530.56s)]
*  Yeah, you see. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10533.2s)]
*  Officer safety event deconfliction system, [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10535.04s)]
*  safeguarding law enforcement through information sharing. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10537.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10540.24s)]
*  So this is how they play keep away from the rest of us [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10541.08s)]
*  where they tell each other what they're doing [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10544.36s)]
*  and the rest of us can't know what's going on. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10547.08s)]
*  Now, when you say blue on blue, [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10549.56s)]
*  there's a situation that I wanna give a name to [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10552.16s)]
*  because it doesn't have a name, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10554.68s)]
*  which I'm gonna call baby on cobalt and cobalt on baby. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10555.72s)]
*  Baby and cobalt are two forms of blue. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10559.16s)]
*  Cobalt is government and baby is like civilians, [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10561.599999999999s)]
*  like you and me. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10564.64s)]
*  What happens when a civilian stumbles [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10566.519999999999s)]
*  on one of these operations? [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10570.039999999999s)]
*  They're not allowed to use these systems. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10571.88s)]
*  I called up the South Florida, I think Case Explorer, [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10574.119999999999s)]
*  had a half an hour conversation. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10578.279999999999s)]
*  They were telling me all sorts of stuff. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10579.519999999999s)]
*  And I said, I'd like to hear about Jeffrey Epstein. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10581.0s)]
*  Who's calling? [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10584.439999999999s)]
*  I'm a private citizen. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10586.28s)]
*  This call will be terminated in five seconds. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10587.52s)]
*  And then they hung up on me. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10589.880000000001s)]
*  So I realized, okay, [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10591.960000000001s)]
*  ordinary human beings cannot use these systems. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10592.84s)]
*  I think a lot of what's going on is that we keep tripping [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10597.04s)]
*  over government operations in the cobalt sector, [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10600.960000000001s)]
*  but we're baby blue. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10605.0s)]
*  And they don't have any system for figuring out [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10606.800000000001s)]
*  how to get rid of a civilian who stumbles on it [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10609.36s)]
*  like a drug smuggling operation. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10612.4s)]
*  So Jeffrey Epstein traffics your daughter. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10615.359999999999s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10618.519999999999s)]
*  If he's an intelligence asset, you don't know. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10619.679999999998s)]
*  You just want the creep away from your kid. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10622.199999999999s)]
*  So you file a complaint or whatever. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10624.679999999998s)]
*  Now you've got a situation where they don't know what to do [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10626.519999999999s)]
*  because you've got a civilian [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10628.679999999998s)]
*  and you've got some sort of super secret dark thing [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10630.119999999999s)]
*  that isn't supposed to exist. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10632.32s)]
*  My claim is that conspiracy theorist [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10634.8s)]
*  is basically cobalt on baby. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10638.08s)]
*  In other words, the government warning a private citizen [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10641.48s)]
*  to get away from that thing. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10645.52s)]
*  We will start to destroy your reputation [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10646.36s)]
*  if you do not cease and desist. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10648.36s)]
*  But there's no plan. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10650.880000000001s)]
*  So if you were the guy who figured out D-Day, [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10651.800000000001s)]
*  he's like, well, there's a huge increase [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10653.56s)]
*  in the inflatable balloons. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10656.32s)]
*  I think that they might be tanks. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10657.52s)]
*  There's no troops under that army designation. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10658.720000000001s)]
*  You'd be a threat to this incredible operation [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10662.64s)]
*  because you have free speech [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10665.84s)]
*  and nobody knows how to shut you up. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10667.0s)]
*  So consider that none of us know the answer [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10669.12s)]
*  to what does the government do [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10671.32s)]
*  when private citizens start to figure out [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10673.8s)]
*  statecraft narratives are bullshit. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10676.16s)]
*  So for example, Jeff Sachs was called in [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10678.48s)]
*  to supervise the investigation [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10682.88s)]
*  into the origin of COVID at the Lancet. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10685.48s)]
*  And he puts in place all of the people [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10687.56s)]
*  who were involved with this through Peter Dajic. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10689.96s)]
*  He later figures out, oh my God, [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10693.64s)]
*  I just put the foxes in charge of the hen house. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10695.119999999999s)]
*  And he blows the whistle. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10698.359999999999s)]
*  So what if we have like a, since the 1970s, [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10699.759999999998s)]
*  the 45 year old workaround [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10703.480000000001s)]
*  of the Biological Weapons Convention in Wuhan, [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10705.2s)]
*  we've created this thing called One Health [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10709.04s)]
*  and the EcoHealth Alliance we took over as a hippie charity. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10710.880000000001s)]
*  And if you ever take a look at the board [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10714.36s)]
*  of advisors of EcoHealth Alliance, [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10716.2s)]
*  it's wildly overpowered, including my old mentor [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10718.560000000001s)]
*  who's the head of the Sloan Foundation [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10721.480000000001s)]
*  and the ex-head of the National Science Foundation. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10722.84s)]
*  None of you guys look at the board of directors, crazy. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10724.84s)]
*  We keep tripping on these official statecraft narratives. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10729.08s)]
*  That's why they won't let us question the Zelinsky stuff. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10732.56s)]
*  They won't let us question the origin of COVID. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10735.0s)]
*  They won't let us question the vaccines. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10736.84s)]
*  They won't let us question whether there are therapeutics. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10738.56s)]
*  These are all cobalt on baby things. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10742.0s)]
*  It's horse to worm, or what's wrong with you people? [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10744.119999999999s)]
*  You're all lunatics. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10746.68s)]
*  You're pathological losers. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10748.16s)]
*  Okay, I get it. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10749.96s)]
*  You're just destroying my Wikipedia entry [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10751.039999999999s)]
*  because I keep asking questions [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10753.48s)]
*  because actually you need to have a timeout. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10755.64s)]
*  You're out of control. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10758.4s)]
*  I'm fine. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10759.359999999999s)]
*  Because you're going to turn this into a pathologizing. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10760.88s)]
*  When you pathologize people who've seen the truth, [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10763.24s)]
*  now you've got a real problem. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10766.199999999999s)]
*  You gaslit American citizens [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10767.359999999999s)]
*  because you couldn't do your effing job? [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10769.039999999999s)]
*  Really? That's interesting. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10771.08s)]
*  Did you kill anyone? [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10772.4s)]
*  Did you do wet work? [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10773.24s)]
*  Did you do digital wet work? [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10774.92s)]
*  What did we just find out from the Twitter files, right? [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10776.96s)]
*  How many times did I say, I'm being throttled, [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10779.8s)]
*  I'm being manipulated? [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10782.279999999999s)]
*  The government doesn't want to take responsibility. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10785.16s)]
*  We have this, what is it, GEC that's from the State Department. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10787.279999999999s)]
*  We have CISA inside of the Department of Homeland Security. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10791.24s)]
*  These people are creating fake conversations on Twitter. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10793.48s)]
*  They're creating fake reports [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10796.64s)]
*  about the Hunter Biden laptop to influence the election. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10798.119999999999s)]
*  We didn't have a free and fair election. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10800.519999999999s)]
*  It had nothing to do with ballot stuffing or miscounting. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10801.96s)]
*  So I believe that partially why we're not talking [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10805.68s)]
*  is that we've done so many bad things around UFOs [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10808.0s)]
*  that we don't want to come clean. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10811.16s)]
*  Wow, that's interesting. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10813.039999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that's one thing. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10814.72s)]
*  Two, imagine that there's one enormous update coming. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10817.08s)]
*  Like your life is partially a lie. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10823.52s)]
*  I think many of us have figured out [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10827.8s)]
*  that we originally believed [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10829.08s)]
*  that it was Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10830.2s)]
*  and now we're not quite so sure. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10831.96s)]
*  Right? [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10834.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10835.16s)]
*  Do you know that it was Lee Harvey Oswald? [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10836.28s)]
*  Certainly the Warren Report [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10838.24s)]
*  doesn't hold a lot of water with me anymore. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10839.32s)]
*  A lot of us are going to have to deal with the fact [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10842.96s)]
*  that a lot of what we've been taught is crazy, [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10845.24s)]
*  is not crazy, like the fact that this virus [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10847.88s)]
*  seems to have come out of a lab [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10851.72s)]
*  where we were trying to figure out [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10853.56s)]
*  how to put a furing cleavage site [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10854.4s)]
*  into a humanized coronavirus. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10856.44s)]
*  And we're leaving in place the exact architecture [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10859.119999999999s)]
*  that got us into this mess. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10861.4s)]
*  Without hearings? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10862.88s)]
*  Without hearings? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10864.119999999999s)]
*  There's no way we would do this without hearings. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10865.119999999999s)]
*  So what we're seeing is we're seeing an explosion, [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10868.08s)]
*  a collision between social media empowered humans [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10870.72s)]
*  who are smart, trying to figure out the story [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10873.56s)]
*  and the government stonewalling us [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10876.32s)]
*  so that we can't figure out our own lives. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10877.88s)]
*  Like, did my children get injected or infected [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10879.72s)]
*  with something that came out of your stupidity [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10883.0s)]
*  because Ralph Barak and Peter Daschknecht [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10884.88s)]
*  can't do their goddamn jobs? [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10886.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10888.24s)]
*  Are we going to have a tribunal [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10890.199999999999s)]
*  about the fact that you infected planet Earth [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10891.359999999999s)]
*  and you decreased human life expectancy [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10893.16s)]
*  by causing us to fight a different COVID infection [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10895.199999999999s)]
*  every year? [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10898.24s)]
*  Maybe. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10899.08s)]
*  These are hugely consequential issues. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10899.92s)]
*  And I believe that UFOs are in part [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10902.64s)]
*  a hugely consequential issue for reasons [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10904.64s)]
*  that may have to do with the fact [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10906.72s)]
*  that this is of the fake version, [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10907.88s)]
*  where it's not overlord, it's bodyguard or fortitude-like. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10910.519999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10914.08s)]
*  But we've certainly gaslit people. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10914.92s)]
*  And I think we're not prepared to take responsibility [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10916.68s)]
*  for ruining the lives of ordinary Americans [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10918.96s)]
*  who were smart and honest because we couldn't do our jobs [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10921.4s)]
*  in the intelligence and defense communities. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10924.439999999999s)]
*  What do you think is responsible for the shift [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10926.48s)]
*  in communication about this stuff now? [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10929.599999999999s)]
*  Because in the past, no one would acknowledge it, [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10931.92s)]
*  no one would talk about it. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10935.84s)]
*  Now they're talking about it fairly openly. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10936.8s)]
*  And they're discussing it. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10939.04s)]
*  When I think about things like that, I go, [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10940.32s)]
*  well, there's this cynic in me that says, [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10942.32s)]
*  well, if they're saying this, then it's probably horse shit. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10944.0s)]
*  They're probably covering up for some drones [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10946.24s)]
*  they've created. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10948.0s)]
*  They are. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10949.12s)]
*  You think? [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10950.24s)]
*  Well, yes. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10951.08s)]
*  In other words, the UFO phenomenon is multiple things. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10951.92s)]
*  We know that it's a cover story for things [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10954.88s)]
*  like the stealth bomber. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10957.12s)]
*  We also know that it's a cover story for our inability [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10959.0s)]
*  to take action against surveillance over flights [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10962.6s)]
*  of dirgibles and balloons. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10965.0s)]
*  We also know that it's people mis-seeing things. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10968.0s)]
*  Like I've seen two UFOs recently that fooled other people. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10971.36s)]
*  But I was able to figure out partially one [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10977.12s)]
*  with the help of Mick West, who is my antagonist, [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10978.96s)]
*  but also we're sort of, we're frenemies kind of. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10981.36s)]
*  And the other one was like a Mylar balloon [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10984.48s)]
*  that looked like a spherical fireworks display [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10986.48s)]
*  off the coast between Malibu and Catalina. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10988.72s)]
*  The way it was being reflected by the sunlight? [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10992.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the thing people don't understand [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10994.0s)]
*  about Mylar balloons is that at night, [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10995.84s)]
*  a Mylar balloon is a very confusing object to encounter [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=10997.6s)]
*  because all you're seeing is like randomly scattered light. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11000.32s)]
*  And it's like, oh my God, you know, [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11003.24s)]
*  this is like the Phoenix lights. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11004.76s)]
*  And I have like video of people in line [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11005.88s)]
*  at a Thai restaurant saying, oh my God, [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11008.76s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11011.48s)]
*  Of course I go across the street to investigate [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11012.8s)]
*  and it says happy birthday. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11014.92s)]
*  So there's no question that it's a certain amount [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11017.04s)]
*  of people wanting to see things that aren't there. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11019.56s)]
*  Yes, that's a big attraction. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11022.24s)]
*  Yep, so this desire thing, [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11023.64s)]
*  you have to moderate your desire. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11025.92s)]
*  It's certainly a cover story. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11028.76s)]
*  It's certainly stuff we can't explain. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11031.76s)]
*  But the claim really coming from Inside the Beast [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11037.68s)]
*  is we've seen stuff that is so clear [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11040.28s)]
*  that we know that there's something there. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11043.28s)]
*  And Eric, we just can't show it to you. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11045.800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the reason that it seems [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11048.320000000002s)]
*  to be government restricted, first of all, [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11050.08s)]
*  it's very hard to take good video with a phone. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11052.720000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you've noticed this. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11055.0s)]
*  They're getting better at it. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11056.68s)]
*  I now spend my flights, I take the window seat [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11058.6s)]
*  and I sit there with my camera glued to the window [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11062.52s)]
*  under stop action, what is it called? [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11065.960000000001s)]
*  Slow-mo, right? [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11070.28s)]
*  Not slow-mo, the time lapse. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11072.080000000002s)]
*  I'm up in the sky for a long time. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11075.44s)]
*  There's basically nothing up there. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11077.080000000002s)]
*  But- [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11079.2s)]
*  So you're trying to find things on your phone? [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11080.04s)]
*  But in part, it's like I do this thing [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11081.52s)]
*  where I take license plates [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11084.04s)]
*  and every time I see a license plate [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11085.640000000001s)]
*  with three letters like NSA or MIT, [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11087.12s)]
*  I take a picture of it. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11090.12s)]
*  So I have a huge number of these things [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11091.2s)]
*  because I'm trying to train my brain, [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11092.6s)]
*  here's what random noise looks like. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11094.320000000002s)]
*  Like in other words, it's not telling you to do something. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11098.080000000002s)]
*  If it says BTC, I shouldn't go out [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11101.16s)]
*  and buy a bunch of Bitcoin. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11102.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11103.96s)]
*  People don't realize that you have to train yourself [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11105.2s)]
*  because you're gonna see lots of patterns [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11107.36s)]
*  once you start looking for them. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11108.76s)]
*  In finance, I used to build random number generators [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11110.72s)]
*  that had the correlation of the markets [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11113.72s)]
*  and I would generate pictures [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11115.52s)]
*  and the financial professionals would say, [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11116.68s)]
*  oh, we've gotta buy, [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11119.119999999999s)]
*  this is a classic head and shoulders pattern [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11119.96s)]
*  and there's gonna break out at such as, [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11121.52s)]
*  I generated this out of a simulator written in Python. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11123.44s)]
*  So people are just, they want to believe so much [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11127.24s)]
*  that they're gonna lie. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11130.56s)]
*  It's an issue. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11131.4s)]
*  It's an issue with Bigfoot. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11132.4s)]
*  It's an issue with everything. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11134.0s)]
*  It's an issue with all of us. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11134.92s)]
*  It's an issue with me too. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11136.0s)]
*  I have desires and I have to keep my desires in check. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11137.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, everyone. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11139.4s)]
*  I am horrible. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11140.24s)]
*  Horrible with the unknown. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11141.32s)]
*  Horrible with UFOs. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11142.96s)]
*  Horrible with. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11144.16s)]
*  We have to camp and decamp. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11145.0s)]
*  And that's what I think what you do is great, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11145.84s)]
*  which is you sort of believe and then you say. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11148.439999999999s)]
*  I give up, I change. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11150.76s)]
*  Right. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11152.0s)]
*  I go back and forth. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11152.84s)]
*  Well, that's what I do. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11153.66s)]
*  Now, at the end of the day, [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11154.5s)]
*  once you've pulled out all the mundane things, [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11156.96s)]
*  the question is, is there a residue left [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11159.48s)]
*  of things that actually are mind blowing? [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11162.48s)]
*  I can't tell you until I actually see stuff [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11165.439999999999s)]
*  that somebody is willing to say, [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11167.88s)]
*  we captured this, it looks like this. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11169.52s)]
*  But I can tell you that I am assured repeatedly [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11171.56s)]
*  by people who seem incredibly sober, [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11174.58s)]
*  who do not seem to be great actors, [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11177.439999999999s)]
*  that they have seen amazing things. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11180.16s)]
*  We have data that is as clear as you can imagine [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11182.24s)]
*  and we can't release it. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11185.64s)]
*  And then you have this question of, [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11187.72s)]
*  is there anyone smart who's trained [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11189.599999999999s)]
*  in this small number of areas who's looked at this? [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11192.0s)]
*  Or are you just gonna eyeball it [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11195.599999999999s)]
*  and pretend that it violates physical law [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11197.8s)]
*  when you don't even know physical? [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11199.92s)]
*  You don't know physical law. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11201.039999999999s)]
*  So far as I know, Eric W. Davis is the top person [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11203.16s)]
*  who knows what a tensor is on this project. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11207.019999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11209.72s)]
*  Try to imagine that you're trying to do [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11211.48s)]
*  the Manhattan Project with the K-pop groups. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11213.019999999999s)]
*  It's that big of a difference. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11217.76s)]
*  People will say, well, we have electrical engineers. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11220.64s)]
*  Like, I don't care. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11222.519999999999s)]
*  I'm talking quantum field theories. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11224.16s)]
*  I'm talking differential geometry, general relativity. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11225.64s)]
*  And people are tired of you. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11227.84s)]
*  Like you're an elitist, you're a snob. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11229.4s)]
*  Oh, go fuck yourself. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11230.64s)]
*  I shouldn't have said that. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11233.439999999999s)]
*  Please edit that. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11234.279999999999s)]
*  You said it soft. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11235.099999999999s)]
*  What? [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11235.939999999999s)]
*  You said it really soft. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11236.779999999999s)]
*  I know, I know. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11237.599999999999s)]
*  It was very soft, go fuck yourself. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11238.439999999999s)]
*  But it's just like. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11239.279999999999s)]
*  One of the kindest ever. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11240.099999999999s)]
*  It was no anger in your voice. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11240.939999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to be an adult, but it's been three years [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11243.679999999998s)]
*  you've been wasting my time. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11245.72s)]
*  You say the word stovepipe as if it means something. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11247.64s)]
*  Shut up and show us what you've got. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11250.32s)]
*  We're your team. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11252.24s)]
*  So I like your theory that they're covering up [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11253.76s)]
*  for some stuff that is, [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11258.16s)]
*  I mean, if really people have been harmed. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11262.08s)]
*  One of the claims of back engineering these things, [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11266.44s)]
*  it's always fascinated me, is that there was, [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11269.88s)]
*  Bob Lazar said this previous person [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11272.199999999999s)]
*  who was working on the job, [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11274.76s)]
*  they died. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11276.36s)]
*  They tried to do something [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11277.8s)]
*  and there was some sort of an explosion. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11279.24s)]
*  And it was limited into what, [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11280.84s)]
*  I think you and him together would be [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11282.76s)]
*  the greatest podcast of all time. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11284.6s)]
*  Would you be interested in doing that? [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11287.6s)]
*  Because you'd be able to tell. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11289.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, we'll dose you up. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11290.52s)]
*  Yeah, but let me just say something. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11291.88s)]
*  What do you want, Adderall? [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11292.72s)]
*  What do you want, mushrooms? [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11293.56s)]
*  What do you got? [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11294.8s)]
*  I want a line of Sonoran Desert toads [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11295.8s)]
*  that every time you answer a question wrong, [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11298.24s)]
*  you gotta lick the toad. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11300.039999999999s)]
*  But you would be able to tell whether or not it's nonsense. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11302.96s)]
*  Yes and no, I'm not the best person. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11305.48s)]
*  You'd be better at it than me. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11307.44s)]
*  I'd be better than you. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11308.279999999999s)]
*  For sure. For sure. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11309.279999999999s)]
*  But you wanna know, look, Sean Caroll and I, [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11310.48s)]
*  Sean Caroll and I don't get along. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11312.72s)]
*  You need to be here for this. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11314.119999999999s)]
*  All right. You. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11315.68s)]
*  I'll show up. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11317.08s)]
*  Specifically, show up. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11317.92s)]
*  You gotta be ready, man. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11319.539999999999s)]
*  If you and him together would be so fascinating. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11321.68s)]
*  His story hasn't fucking changed since 1989, man. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11326.279999999999s)]
*  If he's telling the truth, [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11330.88s)]
*  if he really was this propulsion's expert [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11332.16s)]
*  from Los Alamos Labs who they brought in [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11334.68s)]
*  because they were kind of trying to figure out [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11336.68s)]
*  what the fuck is going on [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11338.16s)]
*  and everything's compartmentalized [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11339.48s)]
*  so no one can talk to anyone, [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11340.76s)]
*  so no real science can be done. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11341.88s)]
*  And they're saying, tell me what you know. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11343.439999999999s)]
*  Let's figure this out. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11345.519999999999s)]
*  And he gets to it and almost immediately, [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11347.72s)]
*  he's like, this is nothing that we know how to do. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11350.199999999999s)]
*  This is nothing that we're making. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11353.08s)]
*  This is something from some, [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11355.48s)]
*  it's something that's not even designed for a human form. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11356.56s)]
*  It's designed, if it's a physical vehicle, [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11359.24s)]
*  it's designed for something much smaller than humans. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11362.44s)]
*  I know nothing about Bob Lazar. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11364.800000000001s)]
*  I've seen something about element 115, [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11366.800000000001s)]
*  which I don't understand is like, [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11369.2s)]
*  he predicted, yes, they're indexed by the number of protons. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11371.24s)]
*  So I can predict that the elements we have yet to discover [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11375.84s)]
*  are gonna be in the same numerical, I don't get this. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11380.04s)]
*  That's interesting. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11384.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I think the claim is different. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11384.92s)]
*  The claim is that this element must have some property [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11386.68s)]
*  or that. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11389.36s)]
*  I'd say it's a stable version of this element [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11390.18s)]
*  and that in wherever these beings are from, [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11392.98s)]
*  they have access to a stable version of this element [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11396.82s)]
*  that we don't have access to here. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11400.66s)]
*  So let me make an analogy. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11402.14s)]
*  Gold, I don't know if you know this about gold. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11403.58s)]
*  What we call gold is the single stable version of gold. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11406.62s)]
*  There are a bunch of isotopes that are all radioactive [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11412.7s)]
*  that turn into other stuff. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11415.14s)]
*  So like, if I have to pay you in gold, [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11417.460000000001s)]
*  if I choose a gold that isn't the one that works, [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11419.7s)]
*  it's completely unstable. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11424.06s)]
*  You gave me unstable gold. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11425.82s)]
*  I know, I gave you unstable. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11426.98s)]
*  What happens? [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11427.82s)]
*  Do you die if you touch it? [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11428.66s)]
*  Well, you'll certainly get some radiation, [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11429.82s)]
*  but you'll also find that there's much less gold [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11432.72s)]
*  every time you check on your amount. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11435.38s)]
*  My precious gold. Oh, wow. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11437.38s)]
*  Right? Whoa. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11438.619999999999s)]
*  But what I'm trying to get at is that [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11439.6s)]
*  it may be a claim that there's an island of stability. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11442.38s)]
*  Like with gold, there's one isotope that's stable. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11444.98s)]
*  Right. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11447.42s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11449.18s)]
*  I'm not the guy for that, but I can, [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11450.42s)]
*  here's the thing, Joe. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11452.9s)]
*  I can tell you what I know and what I don't know. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11453.74s)]
*  And I could certainly probe him. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11456.54s)]
*  The thing that I'm uncomfortable about, [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11458.94s)]
*  I don't know if you saw my interaction with Hal Putoff. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11460.460000000001s)]
*  No, I did not. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11462.78s)]
*  So I interview Hal Putoff, [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11464.460000000001s)]
*  and we're talking about this stuff, [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11466.380000000001s)]
*  and it goes to remote viewing. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11468.34s)]
*  I'm like, oh brother, I have to do remote viewing. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11469.82s)]
*  Now, but if you think about it, [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11472.34s)]
*  when you get like a FaceTime call from your wife [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11474.44s)]
*  who's traveling on business or something, [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11477.34s)]
*  or you're traveling on business, it doesn't matter, [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11479.66s)]
*  that's remote viewing. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11482.1s)]
*  So you don't realize it, [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11484.7s)]
*  but something completely mundane to you, [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11487.3s)]
*  like a video call, [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11489.74s)]
*  is a version of this insane sounding thing. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11491.6s)]
*  It's just done through a device, [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11494.7s)]
*  much like a camera lens sees things, [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11496.62s)]
*  much like your eyes see things. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11500.02s)]
*  You're just doing it physically, [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11501.98s)]
*  it's doing it through a device. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11503.34s)]
*  You're doing it biological. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11504.66s)]
*  So when you hear Hal Putoff say [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11505.94s)]
*  that he made money in the market, [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11508.66s)]
*  that he needed to raise money for his school, [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11510.7s)]
*  so instead of doing a bake sale, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11513.42s)]
*  he did remote viewing in the market. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11514.78s)]
*  I noticed one eyebrow just went up. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11517.84s)]
*  Sean Connery style. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11519.42s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11520.460000000001s)]
*  We did not have a comfortable interaction. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11522.26s)]
*  I was respectful, [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11524.060000000001s)]
*  but I certainly communicated that [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11525.62s)]
*  for a guy who's trying to prove that this stuff is real, [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11528.54s)]
*  wouldn't you like to invite me to your private island [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11531.78s)]
*  if this stuff works, [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11534.92s)]
*  rather than making exactly $26,000 [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11535.8s)]
*  or whatever the target amount was? [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11538.3s)]
*  Right, why wouldn't you keep going with that? [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11540.48s)]
*  Right, it's like, well, I'm too busy. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11542.72s)]
*  It's like, well, I understand being too busy to make money [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11544.76s)]
*  because I've certainly exhibited that behavior, [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11547.76s)]
*  but if making money is the best way of advertising [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11550.32s)]
*  that this stuff is real, [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11553.86s)]
*  why wouldn't you actually do it? [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11556.0s)]
*  So that was a very uncomfortable interaction [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11560.18s)]
*  that I had with Hal. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11562.28s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't do it. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11563.720000000001s)]
*  There could be this thought that, [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11566.92s)]
*  and this is what people would say [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11569.14s)]
*  about psychic ability as well, [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11571.2s)]
*  there could be that thought that some people feel [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11573.2s)]
*  that abusing that power, [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11575.76s)]
*  or using the power for personal gain [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11577.880000000001s)]
*  would somehow or another diminish its effectiveness. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11580.6s)]
*  I so much want to make money from geometric unity. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11583.4s)]
*  But you don't use, but it's not magic. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11586.56s)]
*  Well, but there's something about, [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11588.56s)]
*  not in my father's house, [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11591.48s)]
*  you don't want to be the money changer in the temple. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11593.04s)]
*  I'm happy to make money hand over fist, [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11596.52s)]
*  and I'm pro-capitalism, [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11598.6s)]
*  but selling geometric unity [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11601.080000000002s)]
*  makes me feel sort of sick to my stomach. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11603.04s)]
*  And I think about it. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11605.160000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'm not so pure that I don't. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11606.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11607.560000000001s)]
*  But what I'm trying to say is, [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11608.400000000001s)]
*  you're trying to do something [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11609.560000000001s)]
*  that's supposed to bring people together, [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11610.640000000001s)]
*  and you have a world in which [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11612.240000000002s)]
*  we're losing all support for blue sky stuff. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11614.140000000001s)]
*  So I think in Hal's case, [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11617.6s)]
*  I just felt sad that I threw a bunch of proto shade [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11620.1s)]
*  that people assembled into doubting. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11627.94s)]
*  I think Hal was sincere, [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11631.7s)]
*  but I think what he was saying didn't make sense. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11634.220000000001s)]
*  The remote viewing part of it. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11636.42s)]
*  Yes, and so I felt bad about like- [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11637.82s)]
*  What if it's possible? [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11641.04s)]
*  What if it's just not possible most of the time? [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11642.960000000001s)]
*  Well, for example, let's imagine you, [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11645.66s)]
*  he claims that they sent people [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11647.74s)]
*  to the bottom of the sea in submarines [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11649.46s)]
*  who were able to remote view. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11651.34s)]
*  And so the water is acting as a screen [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11653.619999999999s)]
*  where light can't get to the bottom [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11656.82s)]
*  of the Marianas Trench, for example. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11659.18s)]
*  But neutrinos can. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11661.94s)]
*  So if you imagine that there was some particle [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11663.52s)]
*  that could penetrate and be received, [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11666.58s)]
*  we have telescopes for photons, [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11668.699999999999s)]
*  for gravitons, which is LIGO, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11672.28s)]
*  and for neutrinos, which is like, [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11674.5s)]
*  Ice Cube or Polar Bear. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11677.019999999999s)]
*  So you could imagine that there's some field [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11678.939999999999s)]
*  that can penetrate the oceans that could be received. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11681.419999999998s)]
*  I can come up with a sci-fi story. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11683.46s)]
*  Right, so you would imagine that these neutrinos [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11685.259999999998s)]
*  are containing information [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11688.4s)]
*  and that they're attached to everything all over the Earth. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11689.9s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's what remote viewing is, [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11692.619999999999s)]
*  but I'm saying if you wanted to say, [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11694.419999999998s)]
*  Eric, a gun is to your head, [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11696.22s)]
*  we believe in remote viewing, tell me a fairy tale. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11698.619999999999s)]
*  I could come up with fairy tales. [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11702.619999999999s)]
*  And that could be one of them. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11704.179999999998s)]
*  Do you think that it's possible [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11706.54s)]
*  that there are states of consciousness [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11708.5s)]
*  that can be achieved through some form of meditation [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11712.1s)]
*  or some form of training the mind [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11719.380000000001s)]
*  to get into a very specific focus [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11724.54s)]
*  that would allow you to access information [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11726.980000000001s)]
*  that is otherwise unavailable? [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11729.26s)]
*  I don't have any experience in that. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11731.62s)]
*  I haven't done it. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11733.820000000002s)]
*  So I would imagine it can't be done [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11736.220000000001s)]
*  because I can't do it or haven't done it. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11739.1s)]
*  But isn't it possible that there are states of mind [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11741.18s)]
*  that can be achieved through, [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11744.62s)]
*  whether it's holotropic breathing or whether it's meditation, [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11747.62s)]
*  there's states of mind that are measurably achievable, [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11751.18s)]
*  that are very different from the current consciousness [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11755.220000000001s)]
*  what two people are just talking. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11758.02s)]
*  Is it possible that there's a way that some people have [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11759.62s)]
*  of occasionally tapping in to information [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11763.84s)]
*  that's unavailable to you or I right now? [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11767.04s)]
*  So let's do a junior version and then get to your question. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11768.52s)]
*  Junior version is, is there a way that we can [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11771.56s)]
*  look inside your body without opening your body up [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11775.48s)]
*  to figure out whether you have pancreatic cancer? [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11778.08s)]
*  MRIs. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11780.6s)]
*  Ah, so tomography and the radon transform. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11781.44s)]
*  The point is, any sufficiently advanced mathematics [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11784.960000000001s)]
*  or physics seems like deep black magic. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11790.48s)]
*  Yeah, indistinguishable from magic. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11793.2s)]
*  Exactly, so it's an Arthur C. Clarke problem. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11794.84s)]
*  Now, if you ask me, I'm very freaked out [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11797.04s)]
*  about this cattle mutilation because people I know [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11801.28s)]
*  swear by it and they say this is absolutely, [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11803.94s)]
*  come see the autopsies. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11806.36s)]
*  There's been some weird ones, for sure. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11807.92s)]
*  They're fascinating, but I mean, [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11810.18s)]
*  if you're gonna come all the way here to fuck with our cows. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11812.0s)]
*  Well no, the issue is. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11814.740000000002s)]
*  They don't do it to people, is my point. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11819.380000000001s)]
*  The stapes, yeah but. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11821.0s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11822.92s)]
*  Yeah, but the stapes, again, people think mammals [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11823.76s)]
*  are defined by like live birth and breasts and, no. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11826.64s)]
*  It's three bones in the ear, if I'm not mistaken. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11832.92s)]
*  And those three bones have to do with insectivore ancestors [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11835.6s)]
*  who probably needed their ears detached from their jaws [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11840.28s)]
*  so they could hear high-pitched whining, that's a theory. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11844.08s)]
*  We don't know if it's true. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11846.8s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11847.8s)]
*  Okay, now those three little bones that mean so much. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11848.8s)]
*  What they do is they transmit sound [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11853.92s)]
*  through the tympanic membrane to the organ of corti [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11855.84s)]
*  so that the cilia in this rolled up seashell in your ear [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11858.24s)]
*  vibrate at particular frequencies. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11863.48s)]
*  So when I'm talking to you and I say, [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11865.56s)]
*  Joe, that's absolutely ridiculous. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11867.8s)]
*  What I'm doing is I'm stimulating different hair follicles [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11870.0s)]
*  in your organ of corti to vibrate at different times. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11873.92s)]
*  Or if I go, wise men say. [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11877.36s)]
*  Right. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11880.2s)]
*  That's tone three halves frequencies above [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11881.04s)]
*  back to same tone. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11883.92s)]
*  Those things are perceived as pitch. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11886.12s)]
*  I could imagine something caring about the idea [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11890.720000000001s)]
*  of how do I communicate thoughts [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11893.480000000001s)]
*  through the tympanic membrane using the stapes. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11895.84s)]
*  Does it sound exotic? [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11899.92s)]
*  Yes, does it sound like bullshit? [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11901.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11903.08s)]
*  However, it's not outside of the realm [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11904.8s)]
*  using the doubly scientific method, [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11908.08s)]
*  which is you imagine that there's intelligence [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11910.599999999999s)]
*  on the other end of this thing. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11913.0s)]
*  And it's gonna use every trick in the book [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11914.759999999998s)]
*  because it's smarter than we are [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11916.599999999999s)]
*  to figure out how to communicate with us. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11917.779999999999s)]
*  Now, have I gone out into the desert? [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11920.08s)]
*  Have I prayed? [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11921.92s)]
*  Have I tried to get these things to talk to me? [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11923.039999999999s)]
*  I have. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11925.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11927.88s)]
*  I'm an atheist. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11928.72s)]
*  But these things have a religious effect on people. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11930.42s)]
*  They view them as angels. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11934.48s)]
*  They view them as transcendent beings. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11935.8s)]
*  They think that Ezekiel, [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11938.48s)]
*  the book of Ezekiel is about this stuff. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11940.279999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, it's only my self respect. [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11943.0s)]
*  It's not, I'm gonna run an experiment because it's cheap. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11946.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't I do that? [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11949.539999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't I do that heartfelt? [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11950.84s)]
*  Every Friday, Joe, you should come to our family [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11952.08s)]
*  for Shabbat dinner. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11954.68s)]
*  We pray. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11955.76s)]
*  We may be atheists, but not on Friday night. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11956.76s)]
*  Friday night we believe. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11958.84s)]
*  Right? [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11961.22s)]
*  And my claim is that there are plenty of opportunities [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11962.34s)]
*  using the doubly scientific method. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11967.46s)]
*  If something is much smarter than us [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11969.199999999999s)]
*  and is able to communicate these things, [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11970.939999999999s)]
*  maybe it's said to Hal, [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11973.099999999999s)]
*  look, we can't interfere with you [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11974.179999999998s)]
*  because we have a prime directive, [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11975.66s)]
*  but we can give you indirect hints. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11977.06s)]
*  You know, what do I know? [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11980.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11981.46s)]
*  Do I think it's likely? [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11982.42s)]
*  No, I think Hal is probably not correct. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11983.42s)]
*  Right? [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11987.82s)]
*  But is it impossible to communicate with somebody [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11988.66s)]
*  below the bottom of the seat? [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11991.18s)]
*  No, it's not impossible. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11992.02s)]
*  Even using neutrinos, it's not impossible. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11992.84s)]
*  Is there any mechanism that implements it? [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11995.52s)]
*  None that I'm aware of. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11997.720000000001s)]
*  Do we listen for neutrino events? [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=11999.2s)]
*  100%, 1987A, the supernova. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12000.900000000001s)]
*  I believe that the photons and the neutrinos [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12004.04s)]
*  were screaming at us and arrived almost at the same time [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12006.44s)]
*  because the neutrinos we now know have a tiny mass, [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12009.380000000001s)]
*  so they wouldn't be traveling at quite the speed of light. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12012.0s)]
*  Now, the point is, let's imagine [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12016.560000000001s)]
*  that we had Neil deGrasse Tyson on. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12018.28s)]
*  He's not having any of this shit. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12020.28s)]
*  He's locked into, because he's not really a physicist [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12023.76s)]
*  and at a practicing level, [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12028.140000000001s)]
*  he has to worry about his respectability. [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12029.980000000001s)]
*  He is 100% one of the most brilliant people [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12032.880000000001s)]
*  at scientific exposition I've ever seen in my life. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12036.12s)]
*  But he can't think, he's not ready to do great science [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12040.300000000001s)]
*  because great science has an element [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12044.16s)]
*  of irresponsibility to it. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12046.56s)]
*  And what we don't understand, I think about it, [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12049.8s)]
*  is that when we decide that everybody has to do good science, [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12051.84s)]
*  it's like you doom yourself. [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12055.0s)]
*  Many of the greatest scientists of all time [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12057.24s)]
*  were borderline quacks. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12059.539999999999s)]
*  The belief, for example, that Watson and Crick had, [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12063.08s)]
*  that DNA had to be a helix. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12065.5s)]
*  I mean, Jim Watson's somebody I know, [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12068.24s)]
*  and I dealt with four days straight. [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12069.88s)]
*  The reason he beat Rosalind Franklin [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12073.279999999999s)]
*  is that she couldn't spend one day [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12075.16s)]
*  not being a good scientist. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12076.82s)]
*  She was a good scientist and he admitted he was not. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12078.08s)]
*  Okay? [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12082.32s)]
*  But he was convinced it had to be a helix. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12083.56s)]
*  And from her perspective, it's like, [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12085.4s)]
*  oh, you wanna be Linus Pauling [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12086.96s)]
*  who figured out the alpha helix in protein. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12088.64s)]
*  So you're gonna take Linus's work [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12090.539999999999s)]
*  and you're gonna superimpose it on DNA [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12092.039999999999s)]
*  and explain my Maltese cross. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12094.16s)]
*  And it's not about male versus female. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12096.119999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, Jim Watson claims that if Rosalind Franklin [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12099.539999999999s)]
*  had spent one afternoon thinking it was a helix, [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12102.86s)]
*  she would have gotten it before he did. [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12105.5s)]
*  That's an extremely generous, kind, [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12107.900000000001s)]
*  feministic belief. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12112.1s)]
*  She was a good scientist. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12116.140000000001s)]
*  He admits he was not a good scientist. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12117.26s)]
*  But he was a great scientist. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12120.2s)]
*  And that's the big difference. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12121.94s)]
*  Great scientists engage in quackery. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12123.02s)]
*  Carey Mullis taking LSD or getting stoned out of his mind, [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12126.7s)]
*  coming up with the preliminary chain reaction [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12130.2s)]
*  is an example of great science. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12133.1s)]
*  Right? [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12135.48s)]
*  Richard Feynman claiming that a particle [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12136.32s)]
*  takes every possible path it can simultaneously [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12137.98s)]
*  does not make sense. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12141.16s)]
*  But it's great science. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12143.199999999999s)]
*  It's not good science. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12144.32s)]
*  So it's almost like guitar playing. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12145.42s)]
*  Say more. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12148.3s)]
*  You can be very technically proficient. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12151.199999999999s)]
*  Or you can figure out a way to do something [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12155.24s)]
*  someone hasn't done before [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12159.68s)]
*  and do it in a way where you're, [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12161.6s)]
*  you're using creativity and science together. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12168.359999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12172.24s)]
*  Does this make sense? [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12173.359999999999s)]
*  If you look at, for example, Jeff Beck's version of [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12174.56s)]
*  Drown in My Own Tears with Jules Holler, [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12179.72s)]
*  that is one of the greatest vocal performances [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12183.039999999999s)]
*  I've ever heard. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12185.439999999999s)]
*  I cried, I pulled over to the side of the road [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12186.68s)]
*  and wept when I heard that thing. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12189.119999999999s)]
*  Because he died and I was just like, [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12192.16s)]
*  yeah, whatever, Jeff Beck died. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12193.24s)]
*  I know he's supposed to be the greatest, [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12194.800000000001s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12196.2s)]
*  It's like I have no time for Jeff. [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12197.32s)]
*  I got to drive him once. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12198.480000000001s)]
*  What? [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12200.0s)]
*  When I was a limo driver. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12200.84s)]
*  Hold up. [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12201.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12203.2s)]
*  Wait, break from UFOs. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12204.04s)]
*  You have to tell me you're Jeff Beck's. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12205.76s)]
*  I was supposed to drive Stevie Ray Vaughn, [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12207.480000000001s)]
*  but Stevie Ray Vaughn refused to take a limo. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12209.92s)]
*  Stevie Ray Vaughn would always take cabs. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12212.04s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12214.6s)]
*  And I was a giant Stevie Ray Vaughn fan [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12215.720000000001s)]
*  because my boxing coach was a huge fan. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12217.640000000001s)]
*  He would always play that song. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12221.16s)]
*  God, there's a bunch of them. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12223.119999999999s)]
*  But is it Ireland? [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12224.48s)]
*  Is that? [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12225.68s)]
*  He has this one song. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12227.64s)]
*  Never heard of this. [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12228.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12229.72s)]
*  This guy used to hit the bag [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12232.24s)]
*  and play this one song by Stevie Ray Vaughn [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12233.8s)]
*  and I can't remember what fucking song it was. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12236.039999999999s)]
*  But I became fascinated with Stevie Ray Vaughn [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12238.52s)]
*  because of my friend. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12240.32s)]
*  And as I was driving limos, [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12241.32s)]
*  I had an opportunity to drive. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12243.24s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, I'm gonna pick up Stevie Ray Vaughn. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12244.119999999999s)]
*  This is insane. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12246.119999999999s)]
*  But he was with Jeff Beck. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12247.44s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that's pretty cool. [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12248.76s)]
*  So I drove Jeff Beck. [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12250.48s)]
*  But it was to me. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12252.04s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12252.880000000001s)]
*  I was an idiot. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12253.72s)]
*  You can't lead over that. [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12254.56s)]
*  I didn't know. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12255.4s)]
*  Yeah, I also got a chance to pick up [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12256.48s)]
*  Annie Lennox, security guy. [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12260.64s)]
*  He was this fascinating dude. [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12262.0s)]
*  I really loved talking to him. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12263.24s)]
*  He was a lot of fun. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12264.4s)]
*  And so I got to see, [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12265.24s)]
*  I was like, as close to you are as to Annie Lennox. [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12266.36s)]
*  And this was when the Eurythmics were huge. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12269.24s)]
*  And she was in this restaurant. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12272.0s)]
*  And I swear to God, dude, [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12273.16s)]
*  her voice was like a cable wire. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12275.28s)]
*  When she would talk, [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12280.96s)]
*  it would almost like she had a nuclear voice. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12282.72s)]
*  Like even just her talking, [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12285.48s)]
*  you would like, knowing how beautiful her voice was [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12287.8s)]
*  when she sang, you would be like, [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12290.92s)]
*  oh my God, she's like an athlete. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12292.44s)]
*  Like she's like an athlete talking. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12293.88s)]
*  Would I lie to you? [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12295.44s)]
*  Just the way her voice was carrying in this conversation. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12296.44s)]
*  I was like, this is amazing. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12299.52s)]
*  Her voice is incredible. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12300.44s)]
*  And I was realizing, oh my God, [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12302.039999999999s)]
*  this is like a trained skill, [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12303.4s)]
*  like a ballerina where there are vocal cords. [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12304.92s)]
*  I believe before it was trained, [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12307.6s)]
*  it was just, I have the same feeling [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12308.92s)]
*  about Eva Cassidy and Annie Lennox. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12310.8s)]
*  It's just that these people are not part of reality. [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12312.68s)]
*  Well, is a gymnast a part of reality? [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12316.6s)]
*  I mean, they developed that ability. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12319.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what it is. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12321.279999999999s)]
*  I think we're seeing the final product. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12322.44s)]
*  We're not understanding that there's this long journey. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12324.08s)]
*  And some people have more physical gifts than others do. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12326.52s)]
*  But that's with gymnasts as well. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12330.16s)]
*  Okay, you ever heard Eva Cassidy get sick [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12332.64s)]
*  and sing Stormy Monday and something about the sickness [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12335.519999999999s)]
*  causes her voice to do something [[03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12338.32s)]
*  that no voice has ever done? [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12339.88s)]
*  Oh no. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12341.08s)]

*  Wow. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12344.4s)]
*  Jeff Beck is more vocal than these people. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12345.519999999999s)]
*  This version of Drowning My Own Tears, [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12349.039999999999s)]
*  which is a cover, Ray Charles did a cover version of it [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12350.56s)]
*  and he figured out what the song was supposed to. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12353.599999999999s)]

*  Because her hair was getting blown it to her eyes. I met her at the store. She's friends at Tony Hinchcliffe [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12498.48s)]
*  That's how I became friends with her. Yes, like she doesn't want to hang out with music people [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12503.24s)]
*  She wants to hang out with scientists and and comedians. She loves hanging out with comics. Yeah, that was all the time [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12506.6s)]

*  Jeff Beck, so, you know in terms of [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12520.960000000001s)]
*  Vocal performance I [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12526.08s)]
*  Did not understand what this guy was able to do [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12528.2s)]
*  Multi-dimensional with that whammy bar and using the slide as a pletrum [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12531.88s)]
*  This guy was developing techniques not to not to flash you not to ying-wing mom steam play a million notes a second [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12535.56s)]
*  But he was just like I'm gonna spend my entire life not becoming a rock star [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12542.88s)]
*  but becoming the ultimate technician because of the things I feel in my soul that I want to share with you people and [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12546.72s)]
*  I [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12553.52s)]
*  Didn't get this the only way I found tall is that I thought like, okay [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12554.64s)]
*  I was always thinking I'd get around to Jeff Beck and then he died and was like, okay, whatever [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12558.72s)]
*  I'm too busy and I started feeling shitty about it. I thought what happened to his bassist and I found out she followed me [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12562.64s)]
*  and I was completely [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12568.199999999999s)]
*  Unprepared for like these people who are channeling the universe directly through music. Yeah [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12571.96s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's what it is, right? [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12578.76s)]
*  That's what it is when when someone like a Gary Clark Jr plays guitar [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12581.56s)]
*  There's like you introduced me to at the store when I never met him, you know, it's just like he's a fucking man. Well music [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12585.12s)]
*  science and [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12594.04s)]
*  Humor are my three things that I use to measure human intelligence [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12595.800000000001s)]
*  You can't use an IQ test to get up in the stratosphere. These are the three things that actually discriminate [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12600.12s)]
*  humor [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12607.12s)]
*  music and science [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12608.44s)]
*  Like in general I can assure you that when you order a sandwich at Subway if you do so you don't do it in any [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12610.36s)]
*  particularly special way [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12617.0s)]
*  But let me just say this I saw you work up this thing about [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12618.64s)]
*  professional wrestling is gay over many nights because he kept inviting me to the store and [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12622.48s)]
*  you know, I [[03:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12628.4s)]
*  like this whole controversy about you and Jews and money [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12630.64s)]
*  It really hurt me because I've never seen anybody as non-bigoted as you and I've hung out with you drunk and [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12635.2s)]
*  This stuff would come out and it's just like such bullshit [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12641.6s)]
*  But I did have this like envy which is I want to be the gaze and get you to work up [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12644.44s)]
*  actually what's going on with Jews and money and take the William Tell shot where you get past this sort of dime store [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12651.12s)]
*  Stupid shit and actually like basically the thing about Jews and money is [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12660.04s)]
*  the Jews that had money survived and the Jews that didn't have money died in the camps and [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12666.12s)]
*  Every diaspora community whether it's the overseas Chinese [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12672.68s)]
*  Or you have the parses in India or you have the good ratti's in the east of Africa [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12676.6s)]
*  The issue isn't money Joe its liquidity [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12682.36s)]
*  All of us diaspora communities have to have liquidity or when things turn bad we get screwed [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12685.06s)]
*  right and there is some routine what I found about you and the gaze and professional wrestling thing you [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12691.98s)]
*  Just for people who don't know [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12699.1s)]
*  I [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12701.26s)]
*  Was sitting there at the Comedy Store and Joe says I was watching professional wrestling and it is so [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12702.82s)]
*  Gay that is definitely not how I set it up. Wait a second at all and [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12708.1s)]
*  The audience that freaks out that's a [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12712.82s)]
*  Not how it was set and then you turned around and looked at us and you said wait a minute [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12715.5s)]
*  I didn't say it was bad [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12720.38s)]
*  You did that. Yeah, right and it was like this. Wait, wait, wait [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12722.859999999999s)]
*  What he just turned all the negative energy in the room on us for our latent homophobia and then it was like [[03:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12726.9s)]
*  we all had it and [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12734.76s)]
*  We realized we had it and then if I was sitting next to a gay guy and I started the evening homophobic [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12736.460000000001s)]
*  I guarantee you by the end of that act act which you figured out over multiple times that I saw [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12741.74s)]
*  We were sitting there ready to hug each other. I want you to do the same thing for us Jews [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12747.7s)]
*  I want you know, I want you to figure out your fucking money and Jewish thing and [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12752.14s)]
*  Do for us what you did for the gays because that was a transformative experience [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12757.86s)]
*  When I saw Chappelle take that shot on behalf of Kanye I I have to take a Kanye detour, okay [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12763.220000000001s)]
*  People do not understand what happened with Kanye and I want to talk about this from a Jewish perspective [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12770.92s)]

*  Kanye is like can you come over tomorrow? Can you come out to Calabasas? [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12804.86s)]
*  We're like hanging out me and Kanye as if this makes any effing sense [[03:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12810.42s)]
*  By the way, he's got an NDA that is the most ghetto lawyer thing [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12814.460000000001s)]
*  If you say anything about this meeting will take your child will take your left testicle you will have nothing [[03:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12818.32s)]
*  I'm like, I am NOT signing this. Well, you're not meeting Kanye. It's like fine. It's only Calabasas [[03:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12823.76s)]
*  I'll take an uber home. F you like they call up Kanye like don't let it don't make him sign just come through [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12827.76s)]

*  Like he's got this videographer who's like filming everything and I'm like I cannot deal with this person send him away [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12841.52s)]
*  So he sends him away and Kanye and I have this heart-to-heart [[03:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12847.36s)]
*  And let me tell you something. This is uncomfortable to say [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12851.12s)]
*  I cannot imagine a kinder more creative more gentle more loving more [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12854.400000000001s)]
*  Inclusive person he invites me on the spot to a listening party for his new tracks [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12860.28s)]
*  And I say I have to get home to Pia and the kids. He's like, well, you don't understand this Kanye's album [[03:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12865.44s)]
*  I'm dropping it. It's like I don't care. It's my wife my kids. I gotta get home [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12870.720000000001s)]

*  I'm a math person cut it out. He's like well you have to come to Wyoming. All right [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12880.32s)]
*  We start talking about the concept of slavery in Jewish and black [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12886.279999999999s)]
*  Tradition now part of the reason that Jews and blacks have very high tension is because we have very similar experiences [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12891.48s)]
*  We both have a really deep relationship to slavery in our case. It's Passover in their case [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12897.92s)]
*  You know, it's the history we all know [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12903.02s)]
*  and [[03:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12906.34s)]
*  I say to Kanye there are three levels of slavery in Jewish thought there's chattel slavery [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12907.58s)]
*  We were actually enslaved then there's cultural slavery where we're a diaspora community in other people's lands [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12912.82s)]
*  And then there's self slavery where we can't get past ourselves and Kanye what we're grooving all this stuff [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12918.18s)]
*  Having this heart tight. We're walking around Calabasas and people are yelling out of car windows like, you know Kanye [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12923.66s)]
*  We love you and like every time they do it [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12929.42s)]
*  I remember that there's a Crip alert the Crips have issued an alert from Long Beach that if Kanye strays out of Calabasas [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12931.46s)]
*  He's to be taken out. What? Yeah, when was this? I don't know. Look up Crip alert and Kanye 2018. Okay [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12937.74s)]
*  So Kanye's like, okay, there are three levels [[03:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12944.539999999999s)]
*  reviving blah blah blah and I get this call from Kanye the next day because I'm not [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12947.259999999998s)]
*  I'm just thinking I'm gonna be killed in their drive-by shooting because I can't get home to my wife because I'm hanging out with Kanye [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12951.66s)]
*  And then nothing makes sense in the world. Wow. Okay, Jesus Christ. Now I get this call from Kanye. He's like, oh [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12959.3s)]
*  Eric, I can't tell you how amazing this all is. I was just at TMZ and [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12962.5s)]
*  I was explaining the theory about slavery and how this whole thing works and Jews and Passover [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12967.619999999999s)]
*  I was explaining how much I love Hitler and I was explaining how much I love the world [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12973.82s)]
*  And I was explaining how much I love Hitler and I was explaining how much I love slavery and how this whole thing works and Jews and Passover [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12977.62s)]
*  And I was explaining how much I love Hitler. I'm like [[03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12981.78s)]
*  What? [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12985.220000000001s)]
*  Did you say I was explaining how much I love Hitler. It's like [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12986.86s)]
*  Huh? I missed a meeting a memo something and I realized okay [[03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12991.220000000001s)]
*  Kanye is focused on the spiritual Sunday thing and I realized what this is is Jesus Jesus loves everybody [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=12996.7s)]
*  No matter how horrible you are Jesus loves you [[03:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13004.02s)]
*  Okay, and Kanye is thinking what would Jesus do and I'm realizing like I'm thinking at top speed [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13006.7s)]
*  Like he's talking to about Hitler at TMZ. Whatever. I said Kanye. I want you to listen to me [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13013.34s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I said I want you to run to TMZ [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13019.140000000001s)]
*  They don't want to destroy I guarantee it because you're a long-term property that matters [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13023.02s)]
*  And there's no reason that they would want to destroy you [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13028.94s)]
*  And I want you to beg them not to release what you said don't don't question me just do it [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13031.9s)]
*  He runs to TMZ and they don't release this thing and I guarantee you that they have the videotape [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13040.98s)]
*  So [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13049.699999999999s)]
*  When you hear that the Jews and I love Dave Chappelle, but this thing he did on Saturday Night Live was not right [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13050.939999999999s)]
*  Okay [[03:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13059.519999999999s)]

*  Jews are so fucking traumatized that we are super sensitive [[03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13062.8s)]
*  To anything that makes it possible for people to tell stop you for a second. Sure. He has to do that [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13067.679999999998s)]
*  That's his job. His job is to make fun of something that's in the zeitgeist [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13075.32s)]
*  I hear you that is in the zeitgeist [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13081.48s)]
*  I know you're gonna say the fact that Kanye West is being accused of this [[03:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13083.72s)]
*  Antisemitism and Dave Chappelle is hosting Saturday Night Live [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13089.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's got this fake letter and he goes and that Kanye West is how you buy some time that shit was fucking hilarious [[03:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13093.82s)]

*  You don't think that was funny. Oh, not only was it funny [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13107.0s)]
*  Dave Chappelle is a fucking William Tell level artist [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13110.039999999999s)]
*  He took his bow at an incredible distance agree an apple off of somebody's head so what is wrong with that? Ah [[03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13114.0s)]
*  The issue is that it opens up this issue for people who are not at Dave Chappelle's level [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13121.84s)]
*  Okay, so you made a joke about pizzas [[03:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13129.24s)]

*  That is to me. I know that you guys think it's about mockery. It's about having fun. Blah blah blah. I've been through the comedy mill [[03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13185.48s)]
*  There is an aspect to Carlin's comedy for example or [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13193.24s)]
*  Richard Pryor's or Lenny Bruce's that is timeless and immortal because it [[03:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13197.359999999999s)]
*  Comedy is so much more than getting a belly laugh [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13204.68s)]
*  It's at a different level. I [[03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13207.8s)]

*  I'll tell you the joke about pizzas money in Jews, right? [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13220.88s)]
*  I [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13224.6s)]
*  Used to go to the Harvard School in Los Angeles, which was the top most exclusive [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13226.76s)]
*  Episcopalian school in LA and it was sandwiched between these two beautiful [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13233.64s)]
*  Muscular Aryan men and they would make the following joke. Hey Eric, what's the difference between pizzas and Jews? [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13239.92s)]
*  The pizza doesn't scream when you put it in an oven, right? [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13248.64s)]
*  That's a terrible joke, it's a terrible joke and I lived it every fucking day, okay [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13252.56s)]
*  What is welling up right now on Twitter with Elon purchasing this is a huge amount of anti-semitism [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13259.16s)]
*  And what we need is a country as you and I both know and we've both been in the same fight [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13264.439999999999s)]
*  Is we need a massive coming together. We need to laugh together. We need to break bread together [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13269.08s)]
*  We need to marry each other and have babies so that we're effectively [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13273.32s)]
*  Indistinguishable from each other eventually [[03:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13278.240000000002s)]
*  We need love and partially what the function of humor is is to facilitate that [[03:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13280.720000000001s)]
*  This is how John Stewart reported the news. Hey, I'm the fake news, but he was actually reporting what the real news, right? [[03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13286.800000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay. It is my reverence for Dave Chappelle, which says that he felt he fell short of his mark [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13292.12s)]
*  He took the shot and he hit the apple [[03:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13298.720000000001s)]
*  He didn't hit the kid, but he made it look like everybody could do that [[03:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13300.68s)]
*  He made it look like everybody could do that and now we've got an enormous number of anti-semites [[03:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13304.44s)]
*  Who are focused on this thing, right? I was on your show years ago [[03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13310.28s)]
*  We asked this question about Jews and physics and I made a joke of it [[03:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13315.32s)]
*  He said like why are there so many Jews in physics and I said, oh, I guess we're lucky at physics [[03:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13319.08s)]
*  I'm done with that too [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13323.24s)]
*  we have [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13325.4s)]
*  taken this language about under representation [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13326.76s)]
*  Into our into our souls through this diversity equity inclusion and if you ask about under representation you have to ask about [[03:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13329.96s)]
*  Overrepresentation and you know, who's overrepresented Jews and now we're calling it the Jewish question. Why are there so many fucking Jews Jews Jews Jews? [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13336.8s)]
*  Because we're fucking great at physics and we're great at comedy and I'll tell you something you want to get rich [[03:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13344.08s)]
*  I know that you're rich and you're a comic but in general is comedy a good way to get make money [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13349.68s)]
*  No, it's a terrible way to make money and how many people are there in it like Jews everywhere [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13354.76s)]
*  We've got Jews were poor Jews were rich this and that Jews are basically humans turned up to 11. We're on all extremes [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13360.16s)]
*  We're more criminal than other people were less criminal than other people [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13367.36s)]
*  We are in such danger at the moment because everything is breaking down and when you can't figure out what's causing you a problem [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13371.6s)]
*  People are always going to blame blame diaspora communities. They're gonna blame overseas Chinese. They're gonna blame good rotis [[03:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13378.48s)]
*  They can blame parses. They can blame Jews and we are vulnerable right now and the issue wasn't that Chappelle was great [[03:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13384.32s)]
*  Do we have anyone better than Chappelle? He's a genius [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13391.52s)]
*  Straight-up gangster genius amazing what we're looking for is [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13395.92s)]
*  routines [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13401.64s)]
*  That elevate us beyond what Dave Chappelle turned in. I'm not claiming that Chappelle didn't make a hilarious routine [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13402.88s)]
*  I'm claiming something different. I'm claiming that right now [[03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13409.36s)]
*  We need to heal [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13412.84s)]
*  We need you don't think this humor helps us heal [[03:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13414.84s)]
*  You don't think that was funny and that that first of all [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13417.12s)]
*  No one laughing at that is laughing because they're anti-semitic. No, no people are laughing it just because it's a brilliant thing [[03:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13420.76s)]
*  It's funny. He's he's poking at the bear in the room [[03:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13426.6s)]
*  Yeah, that Kanye West fucked up. Okay, and he's like remember remember already remember Owen Benjamin. Sure. Okay [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13429.92s)]
*  I think Owen Benjamin is brilliant [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13436.94s)]
*  He did so many great routines [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13440.02s)]
*  Really insightful incredibly clever made me laugh and he went down a bad path at some point and I'm sad about it because I think [[03:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13442.42s)]
*  He's a genius. I think the best of Owen Benjamin is fantastic [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13449.9s)]
*  What do you think causes people to go down bad paths because they don't know what's controlling them. They don't know what's going wrong [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13454.62s)]
*  I'll tell you the Jewish strategy straight up is we overcontribute. We over succeed. We over contribute [[03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13461.86s)]
*  You wonder who built America as a superpower. It's Edward Teller. It's Stanislav Ulam [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13468.34s)]
*  It's Robert Oppenheimer when you allow Jews into your country. We pay more taxes. We do more philanthropy [[03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13474.22s)]
*  We make tons of fucking money. We do some criminal shit. That's stupid. We've exploited people which is unfair [[03:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13480.46s)]
*  It's a complicated equation, but that's our equation for survival on balance [[03:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13489.019999999999s)]
*  We over contribute over succeed and we love you, you know, we want to be strong [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13494.0s)]
*  we're loyal and [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13498.14s)]
*  Right now people are scared that there's something that is denaturing our entire society Joe, right? We're not ourselves [[03:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13499.859999999999s)]
*  We're not strong. We're not confident. We can't be masculine [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13507.1s)]
*  We can't have children who we we had we're tiptoeing around trans and the suspicion for who is keeping us from having a normal [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13510.5s)]
*  Interaction is always gonna be Jews. You wonder why I'm all over. Yeah, you wonder why I'm all over the Epstein thing because maybe it is Israel [[03:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13518.74s)]
*  And if it is Israel, it's not Israel [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13525.26s)]
*  It's like a tiny department inside of the Mossad and maybe it's our own intelligence services [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13528.02s)]
*  But I'll be god damned if it isn't a Jew who isn't gonna be pushing this now [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13532.699999999999s)]
*  I've been invited to South America, for example [[03:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13536.5s)]
*  By a very prominent dual national between the United States and Israel like why don't you come down to my ranch Eric? [[03:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13539.5s)]
*  Where we we have fun with this? [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13547.18s)]
*  With Cinderella Luminoso like the shining path [[03:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13549.699999999999s)]
*  It's like what does that mean I'm being intimidated Joe I'm being threatened [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13552.98s)]
*  Because obviously Jeffrey Epstein looks a lot like Ellie Cohen [[03:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13559.3s)]
*  The super spy of Israel who held orgies in his Damascus apartment, right? [[03:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13563.82s)]
*  Now, I don't know Jeffrey Epstein may be a US intelligence product. It may be a joint product. It may be an Israeli product [[03:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13569.58s)]
*  I don't know but I can tell you this [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13575.62s)]
*  It's not the Jews who are behind Jeffrey Epstein and I will be god damned if I won't be pushing that because I'm gonna stand [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13577.78s)]
*  Up for 12 year old girls, whoever they are. This is an immoral human being. I've been on this since the beginning. It's not fair [[03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13583.78s)]
*  So we do do this thing where in some sense you have to understand [[03:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13591.86s)]
*  How how traumatized we are as a people when I hear we aren't oppressed because we drive fancy cars [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13597.86s)]
*  Like my first cousin once removed died on the train out of Kiev when the Germans invade froze to death [[03:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13605.199999999999s)]
*  My cousin is a Mengele twin who forgave Mengele, which is what Kanye was trying to do [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13611.96s)]
*  He was trying to say I'm Jesus. I can tell that Hitler [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13617.359999999999s)]
*  Deserved love and deserved admiration. It's like well look up Eva core, right? You have this tiny [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13620.92s)]
*  Tiny Jewish person is my cousin who forgave Mengele if there's anybody worse than Hitler. It might be Mengele [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13627.72s)]
*  right [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13634.84s)]
*  Kanye was in the wrong scene. He wasn't equal to the thing he was taking on [[03:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13637.08s)]
*  It wasn't his to forgive Hitler and to celebrate Hitler. He's not Jesus [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13641.46s)]
*  But I feel terrible about what happened to Kanye and I'll tell you one of the reasons I feel terrible about it [[03:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13646.4s)]
*  Because all of us were enjoying Kanye's mental illness his genius comes straight out of his mental illness [[03:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13653.34s)]
*  And [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13660.720000000001s)]
*  We loved him because he was so unfiltered so real [[03:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13662.0s)]
*  So when I see Rihanna holding him up my feelings, no, it's not for you to hold him up [[03:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13665.6s)]
*  I tried to save Kanye. I didn't even say anything about it [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13670.060000000001s)]
*  Right and Kanye I think turned on me stopped returning my phone calls because he felt manipulated [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13674.640000000001s)]
*  but the fact of the matter was I wanted Kanye to persist and I didn't want his comment about I love Hitler and [[03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13681.2s)]
*  TMZ to take him out because I thought he was a force for good [[03:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13688.439999999999s)]
*  So yes, there may be Jews that are exploiting him financially [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13691.56s)]
*  But they're also Jews who trying to save him as I believe Lex tried to do a million times. Yes, and it's like [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13694.6s)]
*  Hey, we love each other. We're ultimately we're all family and [[03:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13702.76s)]
*  The thing that I want out of humor is I want our best comedians to be a level or two above where they already are [[03:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13708.039999999999s)]
*  So that was my complaint about about Dave Chappelle. It wasn't that Dave Chappelle wasn't funny as funny as hell [[03:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13714.86s)]
*  It's like I thought beyond that [[03:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13720.18s)]
*  You should have done a routine that brought us all a hundred percent together and what you did was is that you did a routine? [[03:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13723.86s)]
*  because [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13730.66s)]
*  You tried to get it at this level [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13731.82s)]
*  My opinion of Dave Chappelle is that he's way up here. Let me explain how a monologue works [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13734.140000000001s)]
*  Um, there's a big difference between a monologue and a stand-up set [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13741.54s)]
*  If Dave was gonna do a stand-up set on that, okay, he would [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13746.26s)]
*  work that [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13751.62s)]
*  At multiple different clubs a night and he would do it over months [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13753.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it would be something that he would experiment one way. He would add things to it [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13759.660000000002s)]
*  He would he would subtract the shit that he didn't like anymore it takes time it takes time [[03:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13766.98s)]
*  Well, that's what you see. Yes, right? Well, you've seen it. So you knew how it goes. You showed it to me [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13773.7s)]
*  Yeah, but you saw it in actual practice on hundred percent and I gotta tell you how much more I value [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13780.02s)]
*  Watching you as an intellect, which you often run away from I'm just a comedian [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13786.74s)]
*  I watched you look at the crowd as feedback and change your act and change your act and change your act until it's just saying [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13791.460000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you. But you're trying while you're doing that. You're just you're trying to find the beats [[03:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13798.74s)]
*  It's a rare art form where you're practicing it in front of people and the difference between a monologue [[03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13804.6s)]
*  Which Dave has to prepare for in a very short amount of time [[03:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13810.18s)]
*  versus a set like if you want him to have a very complex and nuanced take [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13813.62s)]
*  Subject it's gonna take time. It'll take a little time to figure out and I mean I can only speak for myself [[03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13821.42s)]
*  But my process is months [[03:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13826.9s)]
*  like I have some bits and then they they start off great and then they die and then they come back and then they fucking [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13829.02s)]
*  Get better and some bits they I have to abandon them [[03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13836.380000000001s)]
*  They just they're not working. They're not growing whatever it is [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13839.74s)]
*  And you don't know until you try it in front of an audience and I tried a bunch of different ways [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13842.26s)]
*  And sometimes I try and I'm like, oh my god [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13846.460000000001s)]
*  What the fuck have I got myself into and I have to pull myself out of the bush but it's because [[03:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13848.54s)]
*  there's this experimental aspect to doing live stand up in front of these crowds and [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13853.34s)]
*  After a while when listening to us talk on podcast a lot of fans now [[03:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13859.140000000001s)]
*  No, most people don't though. Most people have no idea what's going on, which is good [[03:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13863.480000000001s)]
*  Because you just want them to have fun [[03:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13867.220000000001s)]
*  so but there's a thing going on where you're trying to sculpt it if he wanted to take that subject and [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13868.740000000002s)]
*  Advance it like this Dave Chappelle, you know coral belt and jujitsu level because that's what he is [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13875.9s)]
*  like he would figure out a way to do it and [[03:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13882.3s)]
*  He would have in a way that wouldn't be objectionable [[03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13885.18s)]
*  And I don't I didn't find it objectionable. I thought was a hilarious take on something that was current [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13887.779999999999s)]
*  It was in the news. It was a thing. He was just mocking the fact that Kanye was being attacked [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13892.82s)]
*  He was not diminishing it in any way. He was making light out of there was a target. He hit it [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13898.22s)]
*  That's how it is like that's I appreciate what you're saying and my response to this and this is what I say to my fellow Jews [[03:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13904.5s)]
*  I say look, I don't want more. I don't want less Joe Rogan or less Dave Chappelle. I trust these people [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13911.02s)]
*  I want more I want to go to the uncomfortable place so that we can all actually [[03:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13917.62s)]
*  Open it up. Just like if you were doing MDMA assisted therapy, right? [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13923.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the idea is if you don't actually touch the thing that's uncomfortable, which is like why are Jews so fucking successful? [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13927.34s)]
*  Why are they in control this it's like I want to go through that and I trust you guys both of you [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13934.54s)]
*  And they're probably a few other people that I trust to do it [[03:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13941.26s)]
*  But it's not many and the point being which is that when other people were like quick to say, you know [[03:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13944.02s)]
*  This is anti-semitic. This is uncomfortable. This is this I had a different response which is and and I think you're teaching me [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13950.62s)]
*  It's not the monologue that you want. You want the routine that is workshopped and perfect [[03:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13956.460000000001s)]
*  The routine takes a long time maybe I didn't have that but I would say the following I [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13960.42s)]
*  believe that ultimately and I don't want to make it the job of the community, but ultimately that is what it is is [[03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13966.22s)]
*  Teach us how to live with each other and love each other when we have these deep suspicions of each other, right? [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13973.38s)]
*  Because we do have these deep suspicions and right now [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13979.539999999999s)]
*  Everything that our government is doing which is holding back more and more and more information [[03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13982.619999999999s)]
*  Makes us suspicious who's really behind this what's really going right, right and [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13987.14s)]
*  That's [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13992.5s)]
*  This is a recipe for another Holocaust [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13993.82s)]
*  Because if you're asking well, who's really behind this I guarantee you one of the answers is always [[03:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=13997.14s)]
*  It's those guys [[03:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14003.019999999999s)]
*  we are counting on you and [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14004.98s)]
*  I just want you to know that and how much love we have and it's why it's a it's not an obligation to stand up [[03:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14007.619999999999s)]
*  For you when you come under fire the whole n-word thing. It's like I posted one picture with my armor and you like any questions [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14013.3s)]
*  You know [[03:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14020.099999999999s)]
*  You guys are essential. It's not it's not just that it's fun to go out because it is fun [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14021.3s)]
*  but the point is [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14027.42s)]
*  John Stewart was doing a real job [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14029.259999999998s)]
*  Reporting the news when nobody could report the news and in a large large measure [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14031.699999999999s)]
*  Comedy or MDMA something like that is necessary for us to examine our bullshit [[03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14037.859999999999s)]
*  mmm, and [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14043.46s)]
*  It's not a task for you because if I say that to you like dude, you're you're loading too much on I know how comedians think [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14045.06s)]
*  No, it's not that it's that you really [[03:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14051.3s)]
*  Only want to take on subjects that you find [[03:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14055.34s)]
*  Fascinating in that moment like when you write out ideas [[03:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14059.5s)]
*  It has to be genuine. It has to be a thing where you're trying to work some can't be an assignment [[03:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14063.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14071.019999999999s)]
*  Understand a lot of anti-semitism and I don't understand a lot of racism. I don't understand it [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14073.699999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. It seems natural to you. It's all but it's also there's too many [[03:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14079.34s)]
*  Fascinating people from all walks of life every idea that you would categorize people by what? [[03:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14084.019999999999s)]
*  Geography they're from or what color their skin is that to me seems so ridiculous and so stupid that I don't entertain it [[03:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14089.74s)]
*  I know it's not a thing. That's what I said is right in my head [[03:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14096.92s)]
*  Even to workshop it and defend it to me. It's like oh my god [[03:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14100.18s)]
*  There's so many more interesting things about people what's interesting to me about people is the [[03:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14103.54s)]
*  Individual human beings take and the accumulation of all of our takes together when we try to work through this thing [[03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14109.42s)]
*  What is this thing that we're experiencing together? What is this? What is culture? [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14115.5s)]
*  What is the learned history of all the human beings that have ever lived before us? [[03:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14120.22s)]
*  Like what is the purpose of our existence here? What is the the the actual? [[03:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14123.86s)]
*  some [[03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14129.06s)]
*  Size of the cosmos that we're existing in like all these different things. It's finite nature of our existence [[03:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14130.3s)]
*  What is good about community and love and friendship? [[03:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14136.5s)]
*  What is good about all those things all those things are interesting to me [[03:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14140.019999999999s)]
*  But when it gets to like sexual orientation or color, it's like who cares. I don't care [[03:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14143.06s)]
*  This is what I said about humans. There's no I don't I didn't want to defend it on any particular thing [[03:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14148.939999999999s)]
*  My point was I've never seen [[03:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14154.82s)]
*  Any bigotry at all because of this radical love sorry for saying but like I [[03:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14156.86s)]
*  Know that you love all walks of life and and you don't need anyone to say that so I was almost embarrassed to say it [[03:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14163.74s)]
*  but like to me [[03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14171.18s)]
*  We're in an emergency situation [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14174.539999999999s)]
*  Whether you can feel it or not. Like if you look at there's a guy named. What is it? [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14176.699999999999s)]
*  He's figured out leather apron club, which is both the name for the Junto that Benjamin Franklin [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14181.22s)]
*  established which is something that we revere and [[03:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14188.06s)]
*  Leather apron was the name for Jack the Ripper. So it's very clever. Martin Bailey, right? [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14190.58s)]
*  But he like he tracks like how many Jewish people does Joe Rogan have on his program, you know, and [[03:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14194.619999999999s)]
*  It's incredibly important that all of us were in a position to do this who don't have to [[03:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14202.42s)]
*  Necessarily worry about like our next paycheck at a company [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14209.9s)]
*  Help everyone come together because right now our government is not because come together [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14215.7s)]
*  we're all sort of vaguely suspicious of each other and [[03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14220.1s)]
*  Nobody wants the assignment in my opinion of like doing work [[03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14223.98s)]
*  It's also a very dumb distraction to be distracted by our differences is so foolish [[03:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14228.62s)]
*  It's just so unnecessary [[03:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14234.22s)]
*  Like our differences are what empowers us because if it wasn't for all the different cultures that exist in the United States [[03:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14235.619999999999s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why it's so fascinating here is because this is a country of immigrants, you know with me [[03:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14242.3s)]
*  It's my grandparents and you know with other people they're direct descendants or or they've come over here from somewhere else [[03:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14248.779999999999s)]
*  Everyone here is from somewhere else and we're all interacting with each other and look at what's been created here [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14255.82s)]
*  Look at the amount and we've succeeded for the most part after a tremendous number of missteps [[03:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14262.7s)]
*  Yes, right. And so partially what you and I are both animated by which is like look [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14268.66s)]
*  We're not even done with the work [[03:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14274.06s)]
*  but look how far we've come and look at what a shining example this is to everyone else and this is like I [[03:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14275.82s)]
*  Wish I could communicate Joe how much fear I have right now as a Jewish person on Twitter [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14284.46s)]
*  With the well of hatred that I feel coming up which has been suppressed and you want to know what I want [[03:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14291.18s)]
*  I want the anti-semites to speak up. I [[03:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14298.58s)]
*  Want to hear them. I want them to have free speech [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14302.86s)]
*  You have two choices in a society like this [[03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14306.220000000001s)]
*  You can either try to control what people think and what they say [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14308.62s)]
*  Or you can have a cultural penalty for saying something that is horrible [[03:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14311.740000000002s)]
*  And I want us to have free speech with a cultural penalty for these things as opposed to having to regulate [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14316.26s)]
*  What you can and cannot say and this issue like I don't know is a Darryl Davies, you know, like these incredibly commit [[03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14324.14s)]
*  commendable [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14332.42s)]
*  Courageous people who wade right into the belly of the beast and bring love [[03:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14333.38s)]
*  You know, this was the thing that I wanted for Kanye. He was trying to say something else. I don't want him destroyed [[03:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14337.699999999999s)]

*  In the absence of this idea that we're supposed to be opposed to other people right people that we don't even fucking know [[03:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14381.62s)]
*  Right. Why would there be any conflict at all between Russia and Ukraine? [[03:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14388.42s)]
*  Why would there be any because there's so close and they're almost the same thing what is going on? [[03:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14393.18s)]
*  Someone is controlling people. Well exactly there's a game that we don't understand and you know [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14397.78s)]

*  Do I support Ukraine hundred percent because they were invaded by Russia. Hello [[04:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14416.02s)]
*  Do I support this at the level that I want World War three to happen? No, no one should want that [[04:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14421.02s)]
*  No one should want that and you're trying to have this complicated thing, which is like look there's serious shit in our past [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14426.62s)]
*  But you're being hurt by a power but we partially antagonize the power [[04:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14433.02s)]
*  I'm trying to hold all these a lot of money involved [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14437.140000000001s)]
*  Oh my god, and not only that a lot of money involved and this is the thing was the thing where I didn't understand with Sam [[04:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14439.78s)]
*  It's like he says there's nothing you can tell me about hunter Biden. It's like [[04:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14445.660000000002s)]
*  Burisma [[04:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14449.58s)]
*  There is money that flows through Ukraine because it is a place where there are chemical labs and biological labs and there's [[04:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14450.86s)]
*  Bakshish and payment and all this kind of stuff and my feeling is we're not allowed to know we're not allowed to pull it apart [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14458.26s)]
*  We're just supposed to say, you know, it's on the other side of the ideological fence [[04:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14464.74s)]
*  You're not even allowed to examine it right and my feeling is the crazy. This is my children [[04:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14468.980000000001s)]
*  I'm on this planet. You're gonna potentially create a nuclear Holocaust over something where you're getting paid in a way that I'm not and [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14472.74s)]
*  If we don't fundamentally figure out how to love each other and to coexist and to celebrate each other [[04:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14480.5s)]
*  And this is another thing about like I'll tell you a Jewish thing [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14487.26s)]
*  We have this one story. We repeat every year in the Passover story, which is [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14491.74s)]
*  Our name for Egypt is Mitzrayim and Mitzrayim means the narrow places and it's literally like the birth canal [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14497.26s)]
*  it's the second birth of the Jewish people and [[04:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14504.14s)]
*  Right now all of earth is Mitzrayim. This is the womb [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14507.54s)]
*  And you say like, you know somebody not you but like somebody says well the Jews consider themselves the chosen people [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14511.7s)]
*  Do you know why we're chosen? [[04:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14517.140000000001s)]
*  We view ourselves as chosen not because like we're the best is that because we're responsible [[04:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14519.380000000001s)]
*  We believe that we are responsible for this planet and we unleashed we Jews Edward Teller and Stanislav Ulam both Jews [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14525.26s)]
*  Unleashed the power of the Sun on the planet, which is dooming us to a very bad end [[04:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14533.46s)]
*  And I believe that we are chosen in the sense that it is our responsibility [[04:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14539.14s)]
*  Not our privilege not our this not of that not that we're on top but is our responsibility to shepherd [[04:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14543.66s)]
*  the birth of the human race into an interstellar species and [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14550.82s)]
*  Like does that sound far-reaching does that sound crazy 100% to my ears that sounds nuts [[04:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14557.3s)]
*  but ultimately [[04:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14563.14s)]
*  In my opinion we feel responsible not for ourselves not to save ourselves [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14564.98s)]
*  But for the entire planet and I hope that other cultures feel the same responsibility that they feel chosen in the same way [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14569.94s)]
*  But right now if you want to ask me I forego all sorts of financial opportunity [[04:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14576.74s)]
*  Because I feel like we unleashed [[04:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14581.9s)]
*  Holy hell on earth that may be a civilization ending thing and what are we gonna do about it? [[04:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14584.66s)]
*  If we are open we we have to realize that what we unleashed to take care of Hitler and Nazism and the [[04:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14590.82s)]
*  Barbarity of Japan like the rape of Nanking [[04:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14598.18s)]
*  We now have to deal with for all time and this is like really important to us. We need to shepherd [[04:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14601.38s)]
*  civilization to safety and if you think about the Passover story [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14608.699999999999s)]
*  It's a tremendous question [[04:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14612.94s)]
*  Why repeat this one story that seems bizarre like you're enslaved in Egypt you follow some crazy leader [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14615.060000000001s)]
*  You go through the Red Sea you wander around the desert for 40 years and you find the promised land [[04:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14621.94s)]
*  This is the story of where we are exactly at this minute. It's not like an old-fashioned stupid fairy tale. It's like [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14628.34s)]
*  You've been telling the story every year for a reason because the people who waited for the bread to rise. That's why we [[04:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14636.74s)]
*  Eat unleavened bread died and the people who understood early, okay, this sounds completely crazy [[04:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14643.1s)]
*  But you're gonna have to make a break for it through the Red Sea [[04:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14649.7s)]
*  wander around in pain [[04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14653.06s)]
*  Before you actually get to safety that is the story of right now and this to bring it back to the UFOs [[04:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14655.3s)]
*  My feeling about this is I'm largely on this program [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14662.3s)]
*  Right now not to promote a book. I don't have a patreon yet. Maybe one day who knows [[04:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14667.18s)]
*  There's nothing I'm promoting other than the fact that right now [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14672.5s)]
*  We are in so much mortal danger as a human species think about everything that you love whether it's [[04:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14676.1s)]
*  Drown in my own tears or box be minor mass or the works of Shakespeare [[04:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14681.38s)]
*  right, you know one forever and [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14686.14s)]
*  back to the Stone Age I [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14688.74s)]
*  refuse and [[04:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14690.74s)]
*  And this is what I've had such a hard time. It's like well Eric. You're so arrogant. You're so you're insane. You're crazy [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14692.38s)]

*  We're getting out of here and we're gonna do it and we're not gonna embrace any of this kind of stupid division [[04:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14703.78s)]
*  It's now time. It's like this is Shackleton story [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14710.060000000001s)]
*  Shackleton stepped up when any normal human being would say look take whatever resources you have and have a good time because you're done [[04:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14713.94s)]
*  It's like no, you know, we're down. It's the ninth inning. This is a bad situation [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14721.060000000001s)]
*  This is the time that legends are made and we're sitting around worried about like can I get the Tesla with gullwing doors? [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14727.98s)]
*  It's like fuck that shit [[04:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14734.42s)]
*  Now is the time for legends and whether you know that that this is the time or not. We have to come together and [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14737.42s)]
*  that's one of the reasons that like [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14745.22s)]

*  People don't really understand how big your heart is because you hide it and [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14755.48s)]
*  That's one of the things I wanted for the Jewish people and I wanted from you which is like more Chappelle [[04:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14759.88s)]
*  More Joe Rogan more humor more love. Let's get through this thing. Let's stop blaming each other [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7CJoGKvx3U&t=14765.56s)]
