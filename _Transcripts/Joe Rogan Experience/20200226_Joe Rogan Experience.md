# Joe Rogan Experience #1432 - Aubrey de Grey
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-z0kglwpwo)
*  3, 2, 1, boom. Here we go. What's up, man? Hey, did you trim your beard since I've seen
*  you last? No. I feel like you have. No, it may be a fraction shorter, but that's only
*  because we're falling out more. It falls out? Oh, yeah. I mean, I stroke it all the time,
*  you know, it's compulsive. Oh, and so then you get these weird hairs that you have to...
*  Well, actually, I don't notice it enough. I mean, it falls out slowly, you know, but
*  I guess, you know, I guess there's a certain amount of attrition that... So the beard's
*  the same length. Have you gotten any younger since I've seen you last? Yeah, hard to say.
*  Hard to say. But that is your business. That's my business, yes. How many years has it been
*  since I saw you? Four? Nearly five, I think. Five years. It was April of 2015. And you
*  have not gotten younger? I have not gotten younger. Have you maintained? I think I've
*  pretty much maintained, yes, but not through my own work. So the work is still very much
*  though we have come a long way in the past five years. But, you know, this is a complicated
*  thing to fix. And we need to fix all of it in order to really make people start getting
*  biologically younger. So let's bring people up to speed. What are the latest revelations? What's
*  the latest in terms of what we understand in terms of what could possibly be fixed about human aging?
*  All right. So the fantastic answer to that question is there are no new revelations in
*  terms of what we understand. Our understanding seems to have been pretty much complete already
*  like 20 years ago. The fact that we haven't found out any fundamental new stuff that we didn't know
*  before then is fantastic news because, of course, it means that we're unlikely to find anything out
*  in the future either. It means that we are pretty much on top of the description of the problem.
*  And therefore, it's all about solving the problem. Is it possible to summarize the problem? What is
*  the problem? What causes human aging? Sure, that's easy. So aging is simply the same thing
*  in a living organism like you or me as what it is in a car or an aeroplane or any other simple man-made
*  machine. It's a fact of physics, nothing to do with biology, that any machine that has moving parts
*  is going to do itself damage in the course of its normal operation as an intrinsic consequence of
*  its normal operation. So in the same way that a car rusts... Damn, he's going to bring that microphone
*  up to you. Is that good? Yep. Yeah, just try to keep it about a fist from your face. So in the same way that a car rusts
*  or accumulates junk in the oil or whatever, similarly the human body does damage to itself.
*  And again, just like a car or an aeroplane, the human body is set up to tolerate a certain amount
*  of that damage so that we can get through to the point where we have kids before we start going
*  functionally downhill, whether mentally or physically. But after that, evolution doesn't
*  care about us anymore and therefore we are only equipped to tolerate that much. And eventually the
*  damage that's being done accumulates to a point beyond what the body's set up to tolerate and
*  that's when things start to go wrong and we start to function less well. What is the difference
*  physically between a younger person and older person in terms of their ability to recover
*  from the damage of just regular everyday life and exercise and abuse and running around?
*  Yeah, all that. So that's just one aspect of the difference between a younger person and an older
*  person. So let me answer that question by stepping back one step. Okay. So the difference ultimately
*  arises from what the body is made of at the molecular level and cellular level.
*  The body accumulates various changes that are chemical and biological consequences of what the
*  body has to do to keep us alive from one day to the next, even starting before we're born.
*  And those changes, the reason I'm using the word damage to describe those changes is because
*  eventually things don't work so well. So you're quite right that recovery from injury is one
*  thing that doesn't work so well, but so are plenty of other things, whether it's how fast you can run,
*  how fast you can think, how strongly you can grip something, how fast you can walk. All of these
*  things become progressively less good. But the point is that the amount by which they become
*  less good is pretty negligible until the age of 40 or 50. It's only then that the decline starts
*  to accelerate. So what do you do in your own life to try to mitigate that acceleration? Yeah,
*  I'm a really bad example of this. That's crazy. This is your business. So there are two reasons
*  why I'm bad at it. Okay. The first reason is that I'm really well built. I'm just lucky. I'm just
*  one of those hateful people who I can eat and drink exactly what I like and nothing seems to
*  happen and I don't even need to exercise to speak of. And I'm biologically far younger than I
*  actually am chronologically. How old are you chronologically? Chronologically I'm 57.
*  How old do you think you are biologically? Well, I'm told that I'm a good decade less than that.
*  And this is what I get told every time I do these tests, which I've been doing for the past, let me
*  say 18 years. Yeah, so that's pretty good news. So you're lucky genetically. Yeah. But the other
*  thing is, you know, I'm working hard to hasten the defeat of aging and maybe it's a net win.
*  You know, maybe the amount that I'm hastening it is more than the damage I'm doing myself by,
*  for example, not getting enough sleep. And you still drink booze? I still drink. How often?
*  Oh, I drink probably more than the average American. What does that mean? A few beers a day.
*  A few beers a day. Maybe a whiskey or two. Yeah, three or four. Three or four? Yeah. Three or
*  four beers every day. Yeah, most days. And a whiskey or two every day as well? Yeah, most days.
*  So six days a week or six drinks a day? Yeah, most days. Wow. You want to drink right now?
*  Only if you have one. Do we have any beer? Do we have any Heineken's or we have the fake Heineken's?
*  We have whiskey. I only drink actual beer, not Heineken. Oh, you son of a bitch. What is that
*  actual beer? Well, you know, IPAs, things like that. Things that taste like beer.
*  Heineken doesn't taste like beer? Of course not. I don't know. I mean, I'm not a balloon. We had some
*  weed infused beer for a while, but I think... Oh, that'll fuck this dude up. He'll lose all of his
*  gains in biological aging. Actually, no, I've never smoked pot. I've experimented with it when I was
*  younger, but it never did anything to me at all. Just get some ice. Get some ice. We'll have some
*  whiskey. I don't put ice in my whiskey, but you'll love it. Oh, you want one of those? Just get some
*  glasses then, Jamie. That's hilarious. You're very specific with your booze? Well, no, not all that
*  specific. When it comes to whiskey, or beer for that matter, I'm not a snob at all. I mean...
*  You don't drink Heineken. You gotta be a snob. Heineken's a delicious beer. Heineken is
*  refreshing, which is, you know... It's like when you call someone's research descriptive. It's a
*  euphemism for not worth much. I understand. Refreshing, meaning it's a cold beverage,
*  but it doesn't have the stout taste that you enjoy. It has the function of water.
*  Oh, right. Or lemonade or something along those lines. Yeah. How frowned upon it is in the
*  anti-aging community to be a person who drinks as much as you do? Everyone in the aging community
*  knows me, and they know that I don't drink to excess for myself. They know that what I drink is
*  what works for me. That's some really good stuff. Which one's really...
*  The legavulin, it's pronounced. How do you say it? Legavulin.
*  You fucked it up, Jamie. Do you prefer this? It's very good. Have you ever had buffalo trace?
*  That's okay. Legavulin's better. Okay. So says you. Buffalo trace is American. That's why you don't
*  like it. My PR people will get pissed off with me for this. In the anti-aging community, I am
*  not frowned upon at all. People know that I do what I do. But everyone says, there will be
*  donors out there who will frown on you for... But it's your own fault.
*  Woo, that tastes like smoke. That's right. It's one of those...
*  Is it smoky? Is it a smoky whiskey? It is. It's one of those peachy
*  whiskeys. It's really nice. It's very smoky. Yeah. Interesting.
*  It'll be popular in restaurants. That's why I know of them selling it.
*  I prefer the buffalo trace. It tastes a little better. It's weird though. It tastes like it's
*  made with smoke. That's right. Is it peaty? That's the word that's often used. Yeah.
*  That's the word that's often used. How bad is drinking for you?
*  Well, of course, it depends whether you drink too much. And too much is a different amount
*  for different people. So if you drink within your limits, if you drink enough that you get a hang
*  over in the morning once a week, then you're definitely drinking too much. The last time
*  I had a hangover must have been when I was a teenager. Oh, okay. You just keep it going
*  and drink lots of water? I don't actually drink all that much water.
*  Really? God, you're defying all the rules. That's confusing. Are you still rowing for exercise?
*  Last time we spoke, you were... Rowing. You don't remember enough.
*  So what is it called? Paddling? What do you call it?
*  So when I used to live in Cambridge in England, I used to be quite an expert at punting.
*  Punting? Which is this thing that you do in Cambridge and Oxford with a stick. That's right.
*  That's what I'm sorry. That you push against the bottom of the river with.
*  It sounds, when you describe it like that, like a really clunky activity, but actually it's
*  fantastically smooth and when you go to it, it's really easy. It's not even tiring. And it's
*  ridiculously romantic. Romantic.
*  Yeah, that's right. It's definitely a babe magnet.
*  Ooh, there you go. And good exercise. Yeah, that thing, yeah.
*  Yeah. Good for balance and that. Is that basically what you do for exercise or do you not do that?
*  I don't live in Cambridge anymore. I live in California now.
*  Oh, you do? You live out here? Yeah, I live in the Bay Area.
*  Good. What are you doing out there? Well, that's where the foundation is based.
*  Oh, okay. Yeah, I've been over here for 10 years now.
*  So, what is a day-to-day life? What's a normal day for Albert Gray?
*  Well, there isn't really a normal day. I spend a ridiculous amount of time on the road because I
*  view, you know, being a high profile member of this community, I view the outreach side of things,
*  just educating people on this as an enormously valuable and important part of my work. And also,
*  it's something you can't delegate because, you know, conference organizers or interviewers,
*  for that matter, they always want the front man, whereas on the science side, we've been able to
*  hire extremely good people. And so, I've been able to delegate that to a very large extent.
*  Now, in terms of progress, like, what has to happen for there to be a shift in the biological
*  age of people where you could actually reverse it or where you could actually maintain the position
*  they're at now for extended periods of time? First of all, let me answer that last part. So,
*  reversing aging is actually going to be pretty much the result of maintaining it. There won't be
*  a justly maintaining it because that would mean that you are repairing the damage of aging just
*  exactly at the same speed that the damage is being laid down, which is ridiculous. You know,
*  if you can do that, you can obviously do it a little bit faster than it's being laid down.
*  So, you don't really need to think about the maintaining part. However, what we need is we
*  need to be able to repair all of the types of damage. And because the human body is so very
*  complicated, there are, of course, a lot of different types of damage. So, it's a divide
*  and conquer strategy. Any of these types of damage at the molecular level, cellular level,
*  can perfectly well kill you more or less on schedule, however well we fix all the others.
*  So, since the beginning, Sensory Research Foundation, my organization, has focused on
*  the most challenging, the most difficult types of damage because basically the easiest ones are
*  being worked on by other people. We have, you see, we set ourselves up as an independent charity.
*  So, we're a charity, we're a public 501c3, which means that if someone gives us money,
*  they get a tax break. But we're independent, which means that we do not rely on peer review
*  government grants or anything like that. We just rely on philanthropy. The most advantage of that
*  is that we're not competing with a lot of other people who have their own ideas about what to do.
*  And in particular, the people who are deciding who wins that competition are not,
*  when you apply for government grants, it's terrible. You end up having to basically
*  emphasize really boring, low-hanging fruit just in order to have a chance at getting funded because
*  people want to avoid funding things that don't lead to high-profile publications soon. So,
*  really ambitious, high-risk, high-reward stuff just doesn't get done. And so, we focus on that
*  because other people can't. That makes sense. And that's very unfortunate that that doesn't get done
*  outside of what you're trying to do. Yeah. I mean, of course, this is a recognized problem.
*  And the NIH, for example, have tried to address it with awards, with types of grants that are
*  specifically focused on more cutting-edge visionary stuff. But the magnitude there is real tokenism.
*  It's less than 1% of the NIH budget. What's frustrating to you about the state of
*  understanding repair and understanding the ability to fix things?
*  Well, I'm not the kind of guy who gets frustrated very much. I'm always a glass half full kind of
*  person. So, for me, what matters the most is the fact that the understanding that this is what aging
*  is and this is how to deal with it has improved so much over the years. So, I started putting out
*  the idea that this was the way to go after aging 20 years ago. Up until then, the only game in town,
*  really, was we've got to make the body run more cleanly and generate this damage more slowly than
*  it naturally does. And that's a very big conceptual difference, right? So, it's not surprising that it
*  took me maybe 10 years to really get the damage repair approach taken properly seriously by my
*  colleagues in the scientific community. But about 10 years ago, it was taken seriously. And in fact,
*  over the past decade, people have been periodically reinventing the idea. And I don't necessarily
*  always get as much of the credit as I probably ought to have, but I don't care about that. The
*  main thing is I don't have to persuade anyone anymore. People get it that damage repair is,
*  at least, if not the way to go, at least a very promising way to go. So, really what happens next
*  is convincing people outside of the community, right? And there, there's been enormous progress
*  as well. So, when you and I spoke last five years ago, really, that was the end of the story. I'd
*  pretty much won the scientific argument, but still no one was really listening. And then,
*  over the past five years, the huge thing that's happened is the private sector interest in this
*  has taken off. So, investors have been coming along. Typically, it's been led by the angel
*  investor types, the seed investors, people who are willing to do really high-risk, high-reward stuff.
*  But they understand that we're getting close enough that this is the next big thing,
*  that we will actually have bona fide, genuine rejuvenation medicine in the foreseeable future.
*  How foreseeable?
*  Well, you know, some of it's already in clinical trials.
*  Like what kind of stuff?
*  So, for example, the stem cell therapies now being used for aspects of aging with a really
*  clear understanding of how they're going to work. Parkinson's disease is a great example of this,
*  where stem cell therapy is the right way to go, and it's in clinical trials. Something that's
*  been in the news a lot over the past couple of years is senolytics, which are drugs that
*  selectively kill what are called senescent cells. So, these are cells that hang out in the body in
*  a bad state, where they're doing more harm than good. Not only are they not doing what they're
*  supposed to, they're also secreting nasty stuff that damages their neighborhood.
*  So, drugs have been developed that are seemingly pretty good at getting rid of those, and they're
*  in clinical trials as well. We used to work on that area. We basically do no work on that area
*  anymore, hardly any. We may end up doing none at all a couple of years from now just because
*  other people are doing it. So, our money is better spent doing the stuff that's still at an earlier
*  stage. Beyond that, we are able, even for things that are a couple of years behind that,
*  so won't be in clinical trials for another year or two, we've been able even then to get investors
*  interested so that we can actually spin the project out as startup companies and focus on
*  the things that remain. It's not just us, of course. There's lots and lots of, I mean,
*  literally way over a hundred other companies now that I work with, because they're not spin-outs
*  from my foundation, but they are doing closely aligned work. So, I'm literally spending probably
*  a day a week on average just making introductions between entrepreneur founders, scientific founders
*  with great science and investors who want to get involved.
*  Pete Slauson The stem cell therapy is fascinating to me
*  because I've had some personal experience with it. I've had some injuries that I cured,
*  well, doctors cured with stem cells in a remarkable way. We're at the point where I
*  was told that I need shoulder surgery and I had a large rotator cuff tear and it's gone.
*  Peter Bauder I know, it's incredible.
*  Pete Slauson It's amazing.
*  Peter Bauder But that's not really what I'm talking about. That's gone really well.
*  Pete Slauson You're talking about neurodegenerative diseases.
*  Peter Bauder Well, the big difference, it's not necessarily
*  brain versus anything else. What I'm saying is that what you got was using stem cells to treat
*  an acute injury, right, a tear. And that's what stem cell therapies have been developed the most
*  for so far and have shown the most promise for. But now we're getting to the point where we're
*  in a position to use stem cells to address certain aspects of aging. In other words,
*  certain aspects of slow, steady, progressive decline that happens throughout life.
*  Peter Bauder Through intravenous use?
*  Peter Bauder Well, not necessarily intravenous. So,
*  let me talk about the Parkinson's disease case in a bit more detail. So, what Parkinson's disease
*  is driven by is the loss of a particular type of neuron. So, of course, in the brain, there's lots
*  of different types of neuron. There's one type called a dopaminergic neuron and they exist just
*  in one specific very small part of the brain called the substantia nigra. So, it turns out
*  those neurons, well, because they do a lot of work basically, they die at a much more rapid rate than
*  other types of neurons. So, we end up all of this with maybe a quarter of those neurons that we had
*  when we were young adults having gone by old age. That's okay. That amount of margin of error is
*  tolerable in the system. It just doesn't have a consequence. But, of course, as with everything
*  in aging, some people have the problem accumulate faster than others. And so, some people by old age
*  will have lost maybe three quarters of their dopaminergic neurons. And that is what gives
*  you Parkinson's disease. So, what is stem cell therapy? If you think about it, what it is basically
*  you put cells into the body that have been programmed, have been developed into the right state
*  in the lab so that they know what to do when you inject them. They know like to divide and to then
*  transform themselves to differentiate into the right kind of other cell. So, what has been
*  developed is dopaminergic precursor cells, stem cells that know how to become dopaminergic neurons.
*  And those are injected into this one place, the substantia nigra, and they do that thing.
*  So, they're injected right into the brain?
*  That's right.
*  Wow.
*  So, actually this was first tried more than 25 years ago. There was a clinical trial in Sweden
*  because people knew what this was driving Parkinson's disease. So, they knew this ought
*  to work. But of course, back then we knew almost nothing about how to manipulate stem cells in the
*  laboratory. So, what they did was these people, they took cells from the right part of the brain
*  of aborted fetuses, right? And they just injected them. Now, this was enormously speculative because,
*  you know, first of all, the brain of an aborted fetus is very, has hardly developed at all, right?
*  And so, just taking the right cells from kind of the right place was hit and miss.
*  And sure enough, almost all the time, there was no effect because, you know, they just didn't get the
*  right kind of stem cell. But occasionally, it worked. Occasionally, patients got lucky and got
*  some of the right kind of stem cells.
*  How often?
*  Well, I think there was a single digit number in the clinical trial that was done, like maybe three
*  or four. But the question was, how good was the effect when there was any effect at all?
*  And the answer was astronomical. So, a couple of years ago, there was actually a retrospective
*  written by the group that did this clinical trial. And it was written specifically about
*  the first responder, the first person who really got lucky and responded well. And it was written
*  on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of that person being treated. What happened with that
*  person was they were treated once, just got one injection, and the Parkinson's symptoms went away
*  so well that the person was taken off their prior medication. There's this standard medication for
*  Parkinson's called L-Dopa, which is a precursor molecule for dopamine. They were just taken
*  off it. Again, no symptoms. Symptoms gradually started coming back after 15 years. So 15 years
*  with no symptoms at all, just from one injection. That's about as good as you can get. So, of course,
*  now that we know so much about how to manipulate stem cells before we inject them, and therefore,
*  how to inject the right kind of stem cell, people are very optimistic. And that's why there are
*  clinical trials already ongoing right now.
*  That's fascinating. So, what's really interesting to me is that during the time this person had
*  this one injection, the rate of progress, the amount of understanding of how to manipulate
*  these cells and make them exactly what you want has increased.
*  Well, that's right.
*  Probably shall still increase considerably.
*  That's right. And so what I was saying about how the Stem Research Foundation is moving
*  increasingly away from bothering work on stenalytics because other people are doing it,
*  that was already true when we started the foundation in respect of stem cells. We didn't
*  need to. Everyone else, all the important work was already being done by other people.
*  So, where are they at right now?
*  Where who at?
*  Where are you at in terms of like, let's just focus on Parkinson's disease?
*  Okay. So, the clinical trials are in phase one, early stage. So, we won't know anything really
*  good for another year, maybe two years. But it's not just one trial. There's several groups around
*  the world that are focused on this. Some of them haven't started the trial yet, but they're about
*  to and so on. So, that gives you a sense of the level of optimism of the specialists in this area.
*  That's very exciting. So, when you look at your future at 57 years old, and you think of yourself
*  at 77, do you think you're going to be the same? If you had a guess?
*  So, in order to answer that, I have to come back to what I said about this being a divide and conquer
*  problem. And the fact that we need to fix all of these things in order to really give the
*  proper result in terms of biological age. Now, that means that any speculation that I may make
*  about the timeframe for when we get there is a speculation about the most difficult parts of the
*  problem. And therefore, it's highly speculative because the most difficult parts are at the
*  earliest stage. And therefore, there's more opportunity for things to go wrong between now
*  and then, so to speak. So, when I am asked to give a timeframe estimate on this, I always make sure
*  to emphasize that it's probabilistic. That what I'm giving you is a timeframe for when I think we
*  have a 50-50 chance of getting a decisive level of comprehensiveness of these therapies. And at the
*  moment, that number is 17 years. Now- That's very specific.
*  Well, yeah. And it is, yeah. I mean, but the thing is, what matters is how that number has changed
*  over time. So, I first started giving timeframe predictions about 15, 16 years ago. And back then,
*  I said 25 years. So, it's only come down by eight years in 16 years, which sounds like bad news,
*  right? But here are two pieces of good news. First piece of good news is that it hardly came
*  down at all for the first seven or eight years. I would say, yeah, five years ago, I was still
*  saying 22, 21 years. So, it hasn't been slipping any further for a little while. And the reason why
*  things have speeded up to parity is because the only thing that was slowing it down before was
*  lack of funding. Beforehand, I was always saying, this is how fast the science allows the problem to
*  be solved. But the science only allows the problem to be solved if the science can be done. And that
*  ultimately biomedical research is inherently expensive. And we are just not able to pull in
*  as much money as we need for this.
*  That's interesting, because it seems like that would be something that
*  most people would have a vested interest in funding.
*  You don't say. And sure, over the past five years, as I mentioned, as things have become
*  investable, things have changed a lot. Every time we end up being able to spin a project out from
*  our lab into a private company, another digit gets put on its budget, like overnight,
*  just because it's so much easier to get people to write a check if they think there's a chance,
*  even a really small chance, that they'll get their money back in spades sometime later.
*  I guess that's what you would expect. But yeah, I mean, of course, the other thing that we always
*  are up against is the mindset that people have got into about aging that they've needed to get into
*  for all these millennia that we have been unable to do anything about it or have any prospect of
*  doing anything about it any time soon. What are you going to do? You've got this terrible,
*  ghastly thing that's going to happen to you in the distant future, and you can't do anything
*  about it. So you've got to put it out of your mind. You don't want to spend your life being
*  preoccupied by it. So you've got to find somewhere to not think about it and get on with your
*  miserably short life and make the best of it. And of course, the only way one can do that is by
*  somehow denying, somehow tricking oneself into denying that this is such a big deal,
*  and thereby pretending, for example, that it's not really like a medical problem at all,
*  and that it's inevitable and universal and natural. Or alternatively saying, well, okay,
*  maybe we could fix it if we try to, but it would be a bad thing. That aging is some kind of blessing
*  in disguise. And that's where all this stuff comes from about, oh dear, where we put all the people,
*  or how we pay the pensions, or when dictators live forever, or when it'd be boring, which I have
*  to spend my whole life contending with. How do you get over the dictators living forever one?
*  Well, last time I looked, dictator was fairly high on the league table of risky jobs.
*  I mean, not a lot of dictators die of aging in the first place. And furthermore, the ones that do die
*  of aging, they tend to have organized their succession in advance anyway. So it's as if they
*  were already immortal. So I mean, come on. Well, not only the percentage of dictators versus the
*  percentage of regular people is so incredibly small to not cure aging because of dictators,
*  seems like the dumbest idea ever. Well, there you go. I mean, but people really,
*  you know, this is what people do, right? They will come up with some reason why aging is a blessing
*  in disguise. And then they will instantly switch off their brains for fear of actually coming up
*  with a refutation of that reason, or even listen to it. Yeah. The romantic aspects of aging are the
*  weird ones, right? Yeah. You know, the inevitable like, oh, it's fine. That's wonderful. I'm looking
*  forward to it. It's essentially a disease that we all get. Yeah. I mean, so I have to be very
*  careful with the word disease. Some people aren't. So you've had David Sinclair on the show. He's
*  been a great friend of mine for 20 years. We have a very similar attitude to, you know, authority.
*  We don't think much of it. And so we tend to push the boundaries a bit, both of us, in somewhat
*  different ways. So he actually, his view of calling aging a disease is a bit different from
*  mine. He's more comfortable with it. I tend to feel that there's a problem with calling aging
*  a disease, which is that it makes it sound like it's something that can be cured with a one-off
*  therapy, like, you know, an infection, which isn't, which it isn't. It's a side effect of being alive.
*  As such, it's something that, you know, you can repair, you can stave off, but you have to do it
*  periodically because the damage is going to continue to be created. And, you know, the reason
*  why that's important is that it determines what kind of medicine we look for. A lot of Alzheimer's
*  research, for example, in fact, I would say most of Alzheimer's research has been predicated on
*  this kind of mistake, on the idea that if we can just cure Alzheimer's, they, you know, so I would
*  say that actually it's not that the word disease is used too narrowly and should be broadened to
*  include aging. Rather, it's the other way around, that the word disease is used too broadly and
*  should be narrowed so as not to include things like Alzheimer's that are actually parts of aging.
*  Because really the difference between the progressive chronic conditions like Alzheimer's
*  that we call diseases and the ones that we don't, like, you know, loss of muscle or
*  decline in the immune system or whatever, you know, the only difference is semantics. Some of them,
*  you know, there are both parts of aging. Some of them are ones that we've chosen to give disease
*  like names to. What would you call aging if you don't call it a disease? Well, I call it a medical
*  problem. That's all I call it. Okay, that's pretty pure. Yeah. In terms of potential future
*  treatments, stem cells seem to be very promising. Are there other competing
*  treatments that you think are equally promising? Oh, yeah. Sure, but they're not competing. So,
*  as I said, because this is divide and conquer problem with a bunch of different types of damage,
*  all of which we need to fix, then we need to look at what fixes are available for each individual
*  type. So what stem cells are there to fix is cell loss, where cells are dying and they're not
*  being automatically replaced in the body by cell division. Have you personally experienced any stem
*  cell therapy? No, I haven't done any therapies of any kind yet. But of course, you know, I'm
*  paying attention. Yeah. I'll see. You know, of course, the nature of aging is that because
*  it's progressive and because it only causes functional decline after a certain point,
*  there's a trade-off that one always has to keep in mind in terms of timing of a therapy
*  between how badly one needs it and how rapidly the quality of the therapy is improving.
*  So, you know, if I take a stem cell therapy now, then there's a chance that it'll be bad for me,
*  for whatever reason. Okay. Whereas 10 years down the road, I will still, I won't have needed it for
*  those 10 years. 10 years down the road, I may start to need it a bit more, but it will have
*  benefited from 10 years more of research and refinement. So you're a cautious pageant. Oh,
*  sure. I mean, I don't think anybody wants to be the first patient. I'm in. I'll be the first guy.
*  I'm already doing a bunch of stem cell therapies. I do intravenous stem cell therapies too.
*  Well, sure. But I mean, the point is you weren't the first to do any of these things.
*  Oh, for sure. Right. Yeah. So yes, in terms of other things, so,
*  senolytics do not compete with stem cells because senolytics are there to do a different thing,
*  to fix a different type of damage, namely the accumulation of these bad cells. And then you've
*  got to have cancer therapies. You've got to have therapies that remove molecular waste products
*  from inside cells. A couple of our startup companies are doing that. You've got to
*  remove waste products from outside the cells, for example. So people have used the immune system
*  to do that. You've got to repair DNA in the mitochondria, these special parts of the cell
*  that do the chemistry of breathing. There's a bunch of different things we have to do.
*  And another piece of good news, I told you earlier on that there's been no real
*  change over the past 20 years in our understanding of what the problem is.
*  It's better than that. There's also been no real need to change our preferred approaches
*  to each of the damage repair technologies. We haven't found bad news that says, oh dear,
*  this potential approach to fixing this particular type of damage isn't going to work for this new
*  reason that we didn't know before. Therefore, we have to start again and think of a new one
*  that hasn't happened either. That's excellent. So it's just essentially
*  refining the procedures or the... Yeah, grinding away and actually
*  implementing them, in fact. Is this something that you still truly enjoy doing?
*  I wouldn't say I ever enjoyed doing it. No? Really?
*  I mean, I enjoy life. I enjoy just staring at the sky from my hot tub.
*  It's just that I want to carry on doing it rather than dying instead.
*  So almost... It's an investment.
*  It's an investment, but it's also, I mean, it's obviously some sort of an intellectual pursuit.
*  No, it's not really. It's a humanitarian pursuit. I mean, some people view it as an intellectual
*  pursuit, but I don't. I really feel... Ever since I was a young kid, I have wanted to spend my life
*  making a difference to the world, improving the quality and, of course, in this case, quantity
*  of life of humanity. And I'm just one of those incredibly lucky people. I've been able to end
*  up in this position of essentially leading the crusade to do that in the biggest possible way.
*  So this is something that you felt compelled to do from a really early age?
*  Not the specific thing. So what actually happened was that as a teenager, having pretty much decided
*  that this is what I wanted to do with my life, the first thing I did was I got into artificial
*  intelligence research. And the reason that happened was because when I was a teenager, I
*  tried my hand at programming. I found I was pretty damn good at it. And I thought, well, okay,
*  I'm one of the big problems in the world is the problem of work. The fact that people have to
*  spend so much of their time doing stuff that they would not do unless they were being paid for it.
*  And therefore, we need more automation. So I'll work on that because I'm good at it.
*  And I had no reason at that time to believe that I was going to be any good at biology,
*  specifically, particularly. And there were other people who were particularly good at biology.
*  And I had made the mistaken but absolute assumption that everybody realized that aging was by far the
*  world's biggest problem. And therefore, biologists would be working on it and grinding away. And,
*  of course, you didn't hear much. But hey, it's a really hard problem. So that's not a surprise.
*  So it wasn't until my late 20s that I found out that I was wrong. What happened was that I met and
*  married a biologist, quite a senior one, actually, who was a full professor at that time at UC San
*  Diego. She was in England on sabbatical. And through her, I not only learned a lot of biology
*  just by accident, you know, over the dinner table, but I also found out gradually that she wasn't
*  interested in aging. I just kind of it hadn't occurred to me. So it didn't come up in conversation.
*  I began to notice that it wasn't coming up in conversation. I started asking questions.
*  And she would say things like, you know, well, I mean, like, it's just decay, isn't it? And I
*  would say, well, yeah, but so what? And she said, well, I mean, you're not going to learn any
*  fundamental truths about the universe from studying decay. And I would say, well, that's true. Yes.
*  But it's bad for you. And she would say, but that's not my problem. And I would say, well,
*  it kind of is. And that would be about as far as we would ever get. So eventually I came to terms
*  with it because it wasn't just her, of course, it was all the other biologists I was meeting.
*  And strange close mindedness. Well, you know, as I say, people have had to find ways not to think
*  about age. And so eventually I thought, well, let's just do and I had to switch fields. And I
*  happened to have inveigled myself into a position where switching fields was something I was able
*  to do. I had a very undemanding job at the University of Cambridge doing bioinformatics,
*  which allowed me to do my artificial intelligence research in my spare time. I was being paid well
*  enough. And, you know, I had access to university facilities and all that. So all I needed to do was
*  repurpose my spare time and, you know, start paying my way to go to conferences because, of course,
*  back then nobody knew me and I wasn't being invited. And so I went pretty well. I started
*  doing quite well received stuff. And so I became quite well respected in the field very quickly.
*  And for the first five years, that was all that was happening because I was basically harmless.
*  And it was then five years in, in the year 2000, that I had this kind of eureka moment that damage
*  repair was the way to go and started talking about what the impact could be. And people started to
*  think I had gone completely crazy. And it took a little while for people to come around.
*  So when you say that at an early age, you felt compelled to try to help people like what was that?
*  So what actually happened was this. It was all down to my mother's desire for me to practice
*  the piano. I think she wasn't a particularly good pianist herself, but she wanted me to learn how to
*  play piano. And so she was she put pressure on me to practice all the time and I was resistant.
*  But somehow or other, my mother had already instilled in me a sense of introspection,
*  you know, a desire to understand why I thought what I thought. So I actually decided to think
*  about why I didn't want to play the piano. And it took very little time for me to realize that the
*  fundamental reason I didn't want to spend so much time tapping away on this thing was that the best
*  case outcome of this would be that I would become a good pianist. And that was just not good enough,
*  because there were already lots of other good pianists. So I would not be contributing
*  significantly to the quality of life of mankind by becoming just another one.
*  An additional great pianist.
*  That's right. And so I thought, well, I might do because and of course, this was
*  very young, so it was gradual after that.
*  How old were you at the time?
*  Probably eight or nine. So over the next few years, I'm going to say this general idea that
*  I played the piano was a waste of time crystallized into the understanding, you know,
*  I was that I could actually articulate that I wanted to make a difference to the world.
*  And so that's how I know by the time I was 15 was when I started programming. And I've just told you the rest.
*  That's an interesting mapping out of your future. You know, at nine years old,
*  recognize you're not going to make a significant contribution to the world by doing something
*  other people have already done.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  That's a really interesting way to look at the world where you're nine. I have a nine year old
*  daughter. I can't imagine her thinking like that.
*  I mean, when I started working actually at this bioinformatics project that I mentioned,
*  I came I had a lot of exposure to a lot of top flight biologists.
*  And it turned out that there were fields that were just fashionable.
*  Right. And that's yeah.
*  And lots of top biologists would be competing for a syphorously with each other to make the
*  next advance in one particular narrow narrow area that was just really fashionable.
*  And other areas would be just completely neglected.
*  I thought, what is going on here? Why are these smart people
*  choosing to do something that minimizes the likelihood that they will have any impact?
*  In other words, basically, whatever they whatever they find out,
*  they didn't matter. They themselves didn't matter at all, because they could have been hit by a
*  truck or done something a bit different and someone else would have found out the exact
*  same thing 10 minutes later. So they were making no difference. I never understood.
*  I still don't understand it.
*  So you've always felt compelled to make a difference. Is that something your mother
*  instilled in you? Is it something you just had as a child?
*  I don't really think my mother instilled in me. I think the introspection was and I
*  if you ask me how she did that, I have no idea. But,
*  but yeah, somehow or other. No, I don't think so. But no, I think the
*  wanting to make a difference is just intrinsic in me. And it's just something that I
*  just realized as a result of the introspection.
*  When you look back at that now, that's got to be an interesting course,
*  where you've recognized at a very young age that you wanted to make some sort of a difference.
*  But knowing that you would have that epiphany at a young age when it comes to like being a
*  pianist or doing something that's going to significantly impact people that is not a
*  standard path that many people are gone. It's a very interesting way to set up your life.
*  Well, I wouldn't say I set my life up. I'd say I had intentions. But if we look at how I got from
*  there to here, an enormous, enormous amount of it was just sheer luck. Right? I mean,
*  most people's lives. Right, exactly. So I would say I had a hope. I had a general aspiration.
*  But I would say that I'm just incredibly privileged to have been able to reach the
*  pinnacle of my chosen field of endeavor. Hardly anyone can say that.
*  Yes. No, there is. You're also, well, you fit the part too. You're a weirdo.
*  I mean, you know you're a weirdo.
*  Well, certainly.
*  I say that with all due respect.
*  Of course. Yes, absolutely.
*  In a compliment as well.
*  Of course. It's definitely difficult to make a difference to the world if you're following the
*  rules. And so I'm always instinctively looking for ways to do things that other people might
*  have overlooked. I mean, even trivial things.
*  Is there anything that frustrates you about this pursuit?
*  I'm not an easily frustrated kind of guy. I mean, of course,
*  sometimes it gets to me how slowly things are going, how resistant people are, how irrational
*  the resistance is. But even there, from some of the things I've already said, you understand that
*  I'm really sympathetic to humanity in this regard. I understand that most people just,
*  the psychological burden of the prospect of physiological decline is so enormous
*  that they've got no choice. They've got to put it out of their minds.
*  Yes.
*  And some people feel, I don't know, psychologically stronger or whatever, and they can
*  bite the bullet and actually work on this, even though it's a very, very long haul.
*  But some people aren't, and that doesn't mean that they are less deserving of the benefits.
*  It's a very strange thing where people put on intellectual blinders and they're talking
*  about aging and dying. It is very weird. Have you had heated discussions with other intellectuals
*  about this? Because I would imagine...
*  All the time. All the time.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the whole thing came to me first when I was at Cambridge, actually, as an undergrad.
*  This was some time before, of course, this was the early 1980s. So when I was in my first year,
*  probably 1982, they brought in a stage hypnotist to do a show. You ever seen a stage hypnotist show?
*  Yes.
*  Okay. So this guy, he's got an audience of a few hundred people, all of us, Cambridge undergraduates.
*  And so the first step is, you know, do some stuff that gets some particularly amenable people into
*  a light trance. And he brings a few of them up on stage and starts to go further, right?
*  So there was this one particular part of the show that stuck in my mind. What happened was
*  that this one guy was brought up and got into a really, really deep trance. And then the next step
*  was that the hypnotist says, okay, this is actually your right elbow and this is your left
*  elbow. So he switched the guy's elbows, right? No elaboration of the implications of this,
*  just saying, just getting the person to completely, completely implicitly believe this thing, right?
*  And then he said, right, I would like you please to touch your right elbow with your left forefinger.
*  Right? And so, of course, there was all this wriggling and writhing and so on, you know,
*  couldn't do it, right? And that was funny in and of itself. But that wasn't the coup de grâce.
*  What happened next was the key thing. The hypnotist says, okay, you can stop now.
*  And the guy stops and the hypnotist then says, you couldn't do it, could you? And the guy says, no.
*  And then the hypnotist says, why not? Ask the guy to explain why he couldn't do it.
*  And here is the coup de grâce, because what happens is the guy gives a completely unhesitating,
*  lucid, grammatically correct explanation for why he couldn't do it. And the explanation, of course,
*  will have a hole in it the size of Canada. But the fact is, the guy won't see it. He'll just be
*  sitting there with a straight face, just doing this. And his friends are out in the, and these
*  are Cambridge undergraduates, right? High IQ, highly respected for each other's intellect and
*  for their own intellect and rationality. And they're rolling in the aisles, and the guy's just
*  unaffected. So when I started to have these discussions with people about aging and started
*  to find out that people make these unbelievable arguments in favor of it, I call it the pro-aging
*  trance. And it was based on that experience from my youth.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I've always said to people, if there was a pill that you can take that would stop
*  all aging, all deterioration and all diseases, you'd be a fool not to take it. You'd be a fool.
*  Do you want to suffer? The idea that this romantic, if it was a rare thing that people aged,
*  a very rare thing, we would look at it with great sadness, that someone was afflicted with this
*  aging. We saw someone hunched over with severe arthritis and osteoporosis and deterioration of
*  the joints and decaying of the cognitive function and they don't know where they are, who they are.
*  We'd be so sad. But instead, we think of it as like, well, he's 90, he had a good life.
*  Peter Jennings That's exactly right. It's not just the fact that everyone gets it. It's the
*  fact that everyone gets it at more or less the same age, chronological age. So, it's considered
*  to be this leveler and just, yes, absolutely. People do a little bit better, 20% better than
*  average. We're people that are more really happy. Is there any concern or any thought whatsoever
*  to the idea of exacerbating overpopulation? Of course, this is a legitimate question.
*  The thing that's frustrating to me is that I've been answering it for 20 years.
*  Peter Jennings What is the answer?
*  Peter Jennings And people still don't listen.
*  Peter Jennings Kill dummies? That's a good move, right?
*  Well, of course, a large part of the reason why it's difficult to get the real answers across
*  is because so much fiction has been written, and of course, movies, giving wrong answers
*  and making a dramatic element out of it, whether it's Blade Runner or In Time or any of these
*  movies. They all make it as if it's actually, they kind of reinforce the pro-aging chance,
*  right? They make it as if life would be even worse if we had no aging.
*  So, what's the real answer? The real answer is very straightforward. It's simply that
*  other technologies that are coming along already and will be established, well established and
*  ubiquitous before we get this to happen, are going to solve the problem because they will
*  increase the carrying capacity of the planet. Remember that the reason why we have too many
*  people today and we've got environmental consequences is not because of lack of space.
*  It's because of the amount of pollution that the average person generates, specifically, of course,
*  biggest thing being pumping carbon into the atmosphere, but of course, whether it's plastics
*  or whatever. And we're fixing that. We've got solar energy and wind energy now that are
*  completely exploding and they're going to completely replace fossil fuels. And we got there
*  without people even having to wake up and realize that climate change is actually quite
*  an urgent problem. We got there simply because the technology got to be good enough that the
*  production of a kilowatt hour of energy is actually cheaper with the renewable energy
*  mechanisms than it is from fossil fuel. And of course, it's not just that. It's also agriculture.
*  So, artificial meat, you know, within not very long, it's going to be both tastier and far cheaper
*  than regular meat and the amount of space we're going to save, let alone the amount of methane
*  that we're not going to be generating. I haven't heard anything saying it's going to be tastier.
*  Of course, it's going to be tastier. How so? Well, how would it be popular if it were not tastier?
*  Tastier? I don't think it necessarily would have to be tastier.
*  As tasty would be good, but tastier would be better.
*  I guess. And of course, it's not just that. There's cheap desalination, there's plastic
*  eating bacteria. All of these things are coming. And so there is no way that one can make a realistic,
*  plausible argument that denies that the carrying capacity of the planet will rise far faster
*  than the population. We don't even need to take into account other things like the fact that
*  fertility rates are coming down everywhere and that once you can live a very long time,
*  they're probably going to come down even further because people who are now choosing to delay
*  having their kids by five years will be able to delay having them by 50 years.
*  Jesus. Do you have that same optimistic perception about the ocean?
*  Well, first of all, let me say what I think about the word optimism, because I know that
*  you're not doing this, but a lot of people, when they talk to me and call me an optimist,
*  they actually mean that I'm an over optimist. And when they call themselves a realist,
*  they mean that they're a pessimist. But anyway, about the ocean, of course,
*  what's the difference? There's certainly a lot to do. One big problem right now, of course,
*  is the ocean is storing a lot of carbon and releasing a lot as it's warming up. So we
*  definitely have to fix that as well, but it's part of the same problem. The less carbon there is in
*  the atmosphere, the less of a problem that is. Direct carbon removal from the atmosphere is a
*  technology that's absolutely burgeoning now, and direct carbon capture from the ocean seems to be
*  something that's equally plausible, though it's obviously different. So yeah.
*  I'm optimistic in terms of the ability to clean up the ocean. I've had Boyon slot on a couple
*  times, do you aware of him, his devices that he's created to remove plastics and other
*  garbage from the ocean? My concern is wild fish. The depletion of the fish populations is at an
*  unprecedented rate, and it seems to be we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 years
*  away from a catastrophic complete collapse of wild fisheries.
*  Well, right. And of course, this is again, a problem that can be fixed by technology.
*  If you can make artificial red meat, why not make artificial fish?
*  Well, that would be good that we can have artificial fish, but that wouldn't necessarily
*  make that population rebound. We would have to make large steps to try to bring back the
*  equilibrium of the ocean. That's not clear. I mean-
*  It's not clear? It's not clear, no. I mean, most of, as I
*  understand it anyway, this is not an area I'm expert on, of course, so I may be wrong, but
*  most of the severe depletions of populations of specific fish species are because of overfishing.
*  So if we're not doing the overfishing, because we're making the same fish elsewhere on land-
*  Well, I'm sure a lot of it is being done by the United States and Great Britain and a lot of
*  first world countries, but I'm sure a lot of it is also being done by countries that can't afford
*  to make this artificial fish or don't have the access to it or at least in the time period that
*  it's going to take before these fisheries rebound. When I talk to people that have an understanding
*  of wildlife in the ocean, they say it's a desperate time, and it's a desperate time that is not really
*  being recognized by the general population because they can still get sushi, they can still get halibut
*  at the local market, but that if you talk to the fishermen, if you talk to the wildlife biologists
*  that are really studying the levels, they're like, this is nearing a point of no return.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't dispute that. I think it's urgent, but all that really says is we should
*  be investing more in the development of these new technologies that will hasten the ability to-
*  I wonder if they even bother with wild fish. If they can make artificial meat, I wonder if
*  people really get into artificial fish as well.
*  I guess so, but some of them are not going to make the cut. No one's getting artificial tilapia.
*  Why not?
*  It's not that good.
*  Not yet.
*  So they make it better.
*  Sure.
*  Why do you even call it tilapia then?
*  Because people like the name.
*  I guess. I'm really optimistic about artificial meat. It seems that at one point in time it was
*  a quarter million dollars for a hamburger, and now they've got it down to a point where
*  you can actually make an animal meat product that does not come from an animal dying.
*  That's right.
*  They're very close to being able to make this in a mass marketed way.
*  That's right.
*  That's interesting. I'm excited about that. I think that's very interesting.
*  And I'm excited about what you're saying that I think people think about overpopulation. One
*  thing that you should take into consideration is that as populations increase and places urbanize,
*  the actual birth rate goes down to the point where places like Japan, there's actually a concern
*  that they're not having enough children.
*  That's right. And of course, it is driven by prosperity. Female education and emancipation.
*  Yes.
*  So at this point, if you look at the largest countries in the world, the largest
*  in the world, the only one that has a really high fertility rate still is Nigeria. If you
*  exclude sub-Saharan Africa, it's basically a completely solved problem.
*  Really? Nigeria is the only one?
*  Yeah. If you look at the big countries you would not expect like Bangladesh or Pakistan or India,
*  their fertility rate is down below three now.
*  Really? That's interesting. So their population will level out over the next few decades.
*  Well, yeah. It's going close.
*  As people start to die.
*  It's still declining. It's plummeting. People often used to say that the only reason why
*  China's fertility rate is low is because of the one-child policy, which of course they have now
*  discontinued precisely because of problems like this. But it's not true. Other countries were a
*  little bit behind. The one-child policy did certainly accelerate the process. But if you
*  look at Brazil or Indonesia or any of these countries, you'll see exactly the same phenomenon.
*  Plummeting.
*  Have you thought about what the future looks like when people live to be 400 or 500 years old?
*  First of all, how wise will people be? That's actually interesting.
*  Okay. So here's a really important thing that I want to get across. When we think about longevity,
*  well, actually three things I want to say. First of all, longevity is a side effect of health.
*  So a huge amount of the so-called debate that goes on about the desirability of all of this
*  just goes away when you remember that people actually quite like being healthy.
*  But in terms of how the world will be, which is a question you asked, there's two questions here.
*  One question is how will the world actually be? And the second question is how will people in
*  the near term expect the world to be? And the reason why those two questions are important to
*  distinguish is because the question of how the world will actually be is very obviously completely
*  unanswerable, even if we look 50 years in the future. I mean, if you look 50 years ago, right,
*  how much of what we have today would have been predicted, right? It was completely different.
*  And certainly in terms of longevity, you know, we're only going to be getting older at one year
*  per year. There won't actually be any 500-year-old people for another 400 years, right?
*  Oh, really?
*  Well, yeah. I mean-
*  I don't know. I don't know what you're going to be able to do.
*  We're not going to be able to change the rate of the passage of time, is my point, right?
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  But expectation is a completely different thing. And here's why that matters. There's going to
*  become a point where people in general, the general man in the street starts to realize
*  that they're probably going to live an awfully long time because they're not going to just get
*  progressively thicker as they get older. And, you know, lots of other reasons are going to exist
*  why they're going to live a long time, like we're going to have self-driving cars that pretty much
*  eliminate, you know, road accidents and so on. So they're going to want a lot of different things
*  than what they wanted when they thought they were going to live only slightly longer than their
*  parents. They're going to want very different pension plans, very different life insurance,
*  health insurance, very different inheritance arrangements. And these are huge big ticket
*  items, right? They basically drive the global economy. So policymakers and decision-makers
*  around the world had damn well better be ready for that shift in public expectation of how long
*  they're going to live, right? Yes. Now, therefore, it is absolutely critical to estimate and to
*  communicate the estimate of how soon that shift in public expectation is going to occur, which means
*  how well what events have to happen, how much progress needs to happen in order for that,
*  in order to cause that shift. Now, this is where I am terrified because I think it's going to happen
*  really soon. I think it could easily happen in the next three to five years and that when it does
*  happen, it's going to happen incredibly suddenly. Here's the sequence of events that I think is
*  going to happen. Step one, we're going to have sufficient progress in the laboratory or the clinic
*  that most of my scientific colleagues are going to be willing to come out and say,
*  more or less, yeah, Aubrey deGray was right all along. They're going to say, yeah, you know.
*  Pete Slauson You're very excited about that.
*  Peter Boudreaux No, I'm terrified and I'm going to tell you why.
*  Pete Slauson You're a little excited.
*  Peter Boudreaux I mean, I know I have been a
*  little bit. Recognition is never something that's driven me. But yeah, they're going to come out
*  and say, yeah, it's only a matter of time before we let this aging thing. Now, what do you think is
*  going to happen next? You're a media guy, right? Here's what I think is going to happen but I want
*  to know whether you think I'm right. I think the next thing that's going to happen is that real
*  opinion formers, people like you, people like Oprah Winfrey are going to hear that being said
*  and written, you know, in the media and they're going to say, oh shit, this is actually going to
*  happen and they're going to say so on air and they're going not only to say what their opinion is
*  but they're going to say what they think people ought to do. In particular, they're going to say,
*  well, look, you know, let's actually, if it's only a matter of time, if we're losing 110,000 people
*  every day worldwide to this phenomenon, then we do kind of have a bit of a moral obligation
*  to make it less time if we can. So my sense is that once that happens, the following day,
*  it's going to become impossible to get elected unless you have a manifesto commitment to,
*  you know, have a war on aging, you know, throw proper money at this. I mean, I really mean a
*  proper war on aging, not just like the war on cancer was, lots of money, not just to do the
*  research but also to front load all of the investment infrastructure and, you know,
*  training and medical personnel and so on. Okay. And everyone's going to know it. Like the world,
*  the public is going to make that switch I just mentioned of expectation like at once. So it's
*  going to be ridiculously sudden once it happens. And the first step is going to be that shift in
*  what my colleagues in the biogeontology community feel able to say on camera and on stage.
*  Now, therefore, the question is what amount of progress is going to be required for that to
*  occur? Now, here's the thing. There aren't very many of us. It's a small field. The number of
*  people at the top of the field who actually talk to the media quite a bit is, you know, a dozen,
*  maximum. There's me, there's David that you've had on the show, there's, you know, very few others.
*  And we all know each other. We're all good mates, right? So we know exactly where our heads are,
*  you know, what the drivers are. The number one reason why my colleagues don't already say what
*  I say is funding. The fact that unlike me, those people are reliant for most of the money that
*  drives their research on peer-reviewed government money, government grants. And they just won't get
*  them if it's possible to accuse them of saying irresponsible things to the media, things that
*  get people's hopes up unduly. Remember, there's hardly, there's nowhere near enough money.
*  There's less than 10% of the necessary money to fund research at the moment. So the committees
*  that decide who gets money and who doesn't are always desperately scouting around for reasons to
*  say no. That can be justified. And saying, oh, this guy says irresponsible things to the media
*  is a totally safe way to say no, right? So anyway, so this is the problem. This is why
*  my colleagues have to be really pretty curmudgeonly. Even David. David is probably
*  the person out of my colleagues who pushes the envelope as much as possible out of people who
*  have regular faculty positions. But, you know, he's just written a book, which I see you have on
*  yourself, called, you know, Why We Age and Why We Don't Have To. He could not have written that
*  book with that title five years ago and kept his job. So, you know, the question is how much has
*  to change? And actually, it's not very much. You know, there's a balance here. There's a tension
*  here between, on the one hand, not saying things that can be characterized as irresponsible,
*  but on the other hand, not saying things that can be characterized as simply untrue.
*  So the more progress is made in the laboratory, not even in the clinic, just with mice, right?
*  In terms of actually, you know, rejuvenating them, making them live longer with treatments that were
*  given to those mice when they were already in middle age. The more progress is made,
*  you know, the more impossible it's going to be to carry on being pessimistic and refusing to
*  make time frame predictions or anything like that. So there's almost a forced pessimism
*  that's created by the establishment. Correct. Well, I think what you're saying makes a ton of
*  sense in that once it does get to the point where this is undeniable, this is peer-reviewed, proven,
*  established science, and also implementable. This is something that can be
*  at scale, distributed worldwide. Yeah, things are going to get real weird.
*  So people are already, people are obviously still going to be saying,
*  it can't be done in humans, you know, it can't really be done, you know, until the cows come
*  home, you know, just in the same way as had happened for any other pioneering technology
*  throughout history. But what matters is what the center of gravity of expertly stated expert
*  opinion is. It is a really, really polarizing subject. I mean, it is funny how what you're
*  saying rings so true that academics and intellectuals have to be cautious about
*  talking about even what is potentially possible, even though in private, they probably are more
*  than aware that there's just a few steps to go before this stuff gets implemented and we see
*  really catastrophic, I mean, really spectacular rather changes.
*  Yeah. And I mean, I'm not saying that all of us absolutely agree on 100% on everything in the
*  science. Certainly, I would say that I'm slightly on the optimistic end of the spectrum of expert
*  opinion. But yeah, my colleagues are not all that far behind me in terms of what they would say the
*  timeframes are. What you're saying in terms of people discussing it in the media makes
*  absolute sense to me that as soon as that Pandora's box gets opened, then people are going
*  to be looking to establish clinics everywhere and it could be very strange.
*  Well, even if a lot of these things are not yet available for clinical use, even if some of them
*  are still at the beginning of the clinical trial process and we're still maybe 10 or 15 years away
*  from the real Makai, you know, that will still be enough to trigger this pandemonium. And that's why
*  policymakers, decision makers in every way, both in government and in key aspect of industry,
*  need to, I call it anticipate the anticipation. They need to have already thought through and
*  prepared for this change in public expectation of how long they're going to live.
*  So you think that this one day will be a gigantic public issue in terms of
*  elected representatives that they're going to need to have some sort of an anti-aging policy.
*  That's right. And the switch from essentially situation normal, as usual, to this completely
*  new world will be ridiculously sudden. It will happen in a week.
*  And do you think one of the motivating factors would be the price of health care that the argument
*  would be part of our issue with health care and the incredible amount of money that needs to be
*  spent on hospitalizing people and treating them with diseases? We could eliminate that.
*  Oh yeah, that's a huge part of it. So at the moment, when you talk to any people,
*  any elected representatives anyway, of any persuasion about the aging question,
*  then their immediate knee-jerk reaction is always, oh God, we definitely don't want to fix that. How
*  would we pay the pensions? Right? Because they obviously, they know it's the economy stupid.
*  Right? It still is. And so that's the first thing to think. And the fact is, you're not going to be
*  able to get away with that kind of thinking anymore. It's going to have to be a case of
*  redesigning a large number of really big parts of the economy from the ground up.
*  Well, especially places like where you live in England, or where you're from rather in England,
*  where they have socialized medicine, the enormous cost of that would be decreased
*  radically if people were healthier. It's got nothing to do with private versus
*  socialized medicine. It's just medicine.
*  Yeah. In the US and the UK and everywhere else, the overwhelming majority of medical expenditure
*  is on the health problems of the elderly, which will go away. Now, of course, the medicine that
*  makes those problems go away is not going to be free, I mean, to produce and to deliver.
*  But prevention is always better than cure. But that actually is only a minority of the economic
*  benefit. The real economic benefit comes from the indirect costs. First of all, the fact that the
*  kids of the elderly are going to be more productive because they're not having to spend time looking
*  after their sick parents and related things like that. But also the huge thing that the
*  elders themselves are still going to be able-bodied and therefore in a position to continue to
*  contribute wealth to society. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean anything to do with the
*  retirement age. This comes back to another aspect of the interaction between emerging
*  technologies. So of course, we've got automation coming. I don't work on it anymore, but lots of
*  people do, right? We're making huge progress in artificial intelligence. And most people,
*  even conservative commentators, say that most of the jobs that exist today are going to be gone
*  20 years from now because machines will be doing things perfectly well. So we're going to be
*  completely unable to continue this system of an economy based on full employment. Last time this
*  happened with the Industrial Revolution, we got away with it by inventing an entire new sector,
*  the service sector that replaced all the jobs that people didn't have anymore in manufacturing
*  and agriculture. It's not going to happen this time. It's not going to happen. How many people
*  do you need in the entertainment industry? We've got you, Phil, come on. So we're going to have a
*  different... Of course, people are already thinking about that with things like universal basic income,
*  which is an extraordinarily blunt instrument. It's just a starting point, but that kind of
*  thing is going to happen. I can totally imagine a situation in which 30, 40 years from now,
*  work is something like national service used to be. When you're young and insignificant,
*  you do a few years of actual work and then you... Yeah, but that means that the whole concept of
*  pensions is ridiculous to think about that. So we've got to get policymakers out of that mindset
*  and to get them to think in more global terms about the health benefits and the benefits to
*  quality of life of everybody and so on. It is funny that work or the concept of work is sort
*  of inexorably connected to society to the point where you think you have to work. But meanwhile,
*  people lived for hundreds of thousands of years without even the concept of that,
*  a place where you go where they give you gold coins. Well, right, exactly. Yeah, I mean, of
*  course, you do have to have something that makes... Something. Something to do that you find
*  fulfilling. That's the argument for universal basic income, right? The argument against it
*  is human nature, that people need to be motivated and they need something to sort of guide them
*  towards excellence. Yeah, my take is the only thing that needs is better education,
*  which of course is something that we could spend the money on that we save from not having to...
*  You are a glass half full guy. Well, I don't know anybody well educated who gets bored, you know.
*  Yeah, I agree with you. Or anybody who's been exposed to interesting things. There are so
*  many things in this world. I mean, if I had... I would love to live five different lives
*  concurrently. I would love to. That's the plan. I would love to. But they don't have to be
*  concurrent. They can be sequential. But I want to just dive into the... I would love to live
*  different lives because there's so many different things that I would have loved to pursue.
*  Well, you can't live them concurrently because you've only got one brain, but let's try and make
*  you live them sequentially instead. Yeah, well, sequentially would be fun. I mean, it would be
*  really interesting to take up a whole new career at 70, you know. And so this three to five year
*  timeline, what makes you think that three to five years from now is when all this stuff will take
*  place? Well, of course it's subjective. It's based on aggregating a whole bunch of different
*  areas of research. But of course, I'm fairly well informed about where research currently is and how
*  rapidly it's moving in a variety of different areas. And so just, you know, just I'm putting
*  all that together in my head and I'm saying how soon are we going to be able to take mice that
*  normally live, let's say two and a half years and do nothing whatsoever to them until they are one
*  and a half and get them to on average live to four instead of two and a half. Right. Now,
*  if you can, and of course those extra years would be healthy years because we would be rejuvenating
*  the mice. Right. So I believe that that would be sufficient. And that's actually a little bit
*  conservative. I think a less dramatic breakthrough than that might be enough to switch most of my
*  colleagues over, get them over the fence. But I think that would definitely be enough. And I think
*  that that is close. What was the research done with mice with myostatin inhibitors? Did that not
*  increase lifespan as well? Yeah, sure. I mean, a lot of things have extended lifespan a fair bit,
*  but what we have at the moment is not all the components of what I just said. If you do something
*  genetic to mice, or if you do it to them throughout their lives, then we can already get that year,
*  year and a half out of mice. Certainly a year. Okay. But not if you start at 18 months. If you
*  start at 18 months, the best we can do is maybe four months. So that's the difference. You've got
*  to be able to start late and get the big extension. And you're not going to get that without bona fide
*  rejuvenation. So that's not going to come by way of genetics. Well, even if it did come by way of
*  genetics, it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't persuade my colleagues or me that we were on the brink of
*  doing it for humans who have the misfortune of being already alive. So the rejuvenation is going
*  to come through some sort of biologics? Well, yes, through the kinds of things we're working on that
*  I mentioned earlier. Stem cells, gene therapy to do various things to introduce, for example,
*  bacterial enzymes that can break down waste products, phenoletics that I talked about,
*  pharmaceuticals to do other things. What about the use of CRISPR? Sure. Well, CRISPR is a very,
*  important part of this. So can you please explain what CRISPR means for people who don't know what
*  we're talking about? Sure. Yes. So CRISPR is a technology that was first developed about eight
*  years ago now. And it is the exploitation of a bacterial mechanism that allows bacteria to
*  defend themselves against viruses. Essentially how it works is that it allows us to change the
*  sequence of our genome in a particular cell in a very specific way. It's often called gene editing.
*  And there are other technologies for gene editing that already existed before CRISPR,
*  very laborious, very expensive and very clunky. This is far, far cheaper and easier to use.
*  So what that does is it allows us, for example, to inactivate a gene or for that matter to
*  to change the sequence of a gene from a mutant form into a normal form so that it works when it
*  was previously not working. Now, doing that in the laboratory in a petri dish is fair enough. The
*  question is, can we do it in the body? And initially, no. Initially, this technology was
*  too error prone. It was prone to do what George Church has called genetic vandalism and
*  make have what's called off target effects. In other words, basically do other changes to
*  the genome elsewhere that you didn't want. But of course, people have known this and people have
*  been working really hard to improve the technology. And it's getting to the point now where it's
*  possible to actually use it on humans. Maybe, you know, it's getting it's getting there.
*  Now, you can't do everything with CRISPR. One thing you definitely can't do with CRISPR is insert new
*  genes into the genome. And that's something we really need to be able to do. But actually,
*  one of our big projects is a kind of two step thing where we use CRISPR to make a small change
*  to the genome that allows us to insert large genes where we couldn't previously. So, yeah,
*  so CRISPR is huge. And it's huge not only in aging research, but across the whole board of
*  biomedical work. That's they have done some work in China, apparently on live human beings. So this
*  was very controversial. What happened was that a group in China used CRISPR to alter the DNA
*  of embryos that were going to be used for IVF, for image fertilization. And the change that was
*  made was itself quite a curious one. Essentially, what they did was they tried to change a gene
*  called CCR5 into a mutant form that doesn't work, but that in its inactive form,
*  protects the body from infection by HIV. This is something that was discovered a long time ago.
*  And maybe 1% of people have this genotype. And so this was introduced. Unfortunately, first of all,
*  it probably wasn't done very well. But also, well, they what people looked at the
*  at the process and it probably didn't they probably didn't make the correct modification.
*  But also, it's not clear whether doing it for someone lifelong is actually a good thing.
*  Because as I say, it's an inactivation of a gene that must exist for a reason or it wouldn't exist
*  at all. Right. But didn't it also have a side effect of increased intelligence?
*  That is complete speculation. Is it? Yes. Why? What would cause them to speculate that?
*  People speculate all the time. That's just like clickbait stuff that gets people excited about it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But yes. So anyway, the other thing was that it's not obvious why it's even
*  worthwhile to make an embryo genetically resistant to HIV. First of all, they don't have HIV yet in
*  the first place. And they may never get it. And secondly, we've got drugs that work pretty well
*  to control HIV antiretroviral. So yeah, so, so it's not obvious why this would
*  a sensible thing to do in the first place. However, it's certainly got a whole bunch of
*  debate going. So yeah. Well, when I hear about something like that, I always assume,
*  first of all, I mean, just American prejudice, you assume that it's in China, they're doing
*  something crazy. Right. And you also assume that if they're telling you about someone who's
*  been altered, that means that they've probably been doing this for a decade.
*  Or since CRISPR was initiated eight years ago. You never know. Yeah, you never know. It's just,
*  it's interesting to me. And I don't want them to do it on people. But when they do do it on people,
*  I'm fascinated. You know, it's, I don't, you know, well, that's right. I mean, that's the attitude
*  that I have. And a lot of people have to medical tourism in general. Yes, that the, you know,
*  these are not adequately regulated treatments. And they are certainly not adequately characterized.
*  In other words, the people who get the treatments are people who pay for them rather than people
*  who have been chosen to be in a standardized group of any kind. And there tends to be very little
*  follow up. But still, it's better than nothing in the sense that, you know, some information exists
*  about the efficacy and safety of these treatments as a result. The more that exists, the better,
*  the more that people who are administering these treatments can be induced to reveal their data,
*  the better, you know, even if it's anonymized. But, you know, other people, some scientists,
*  quite a lot of scientists take a much stronger view that, you know, we just should oppose all
*  of this period. And we should just say, you know, everyone who indulges, who gives treatments to
*  people in offshore places should be shut down as much as best we can, and should be demonized.
*  And I don't really think that's true. I think there's a halfway house.
*  Um, personally, I've had my family, my mother has gone to Panama twice,
*  and she was on the verge of a knee replacement. And now she walks without pain.
*  Yeah, I bet you I bet she went to Neil Riaz's clinic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there are a
*  lot of people who have very good stories out of Neil's group. And I, of course, the thing is,
*  you don't know, unless someone has a really bad story, whether things are going wrong. So,
*  I don't have I mean, I don't know whether Neil releases numbers, the total number of patients
*  per year that he treats. So we don't know his hit rate. Yeah, I don't know. I just do know that I
*  have speaking spoken to several fighters from the UFC that have gone down there. And again,
*  my mother was, I mean, she didn't want to get a knee replacement. So when I sent her down there,
*  and it took she's 52, she's 73. So it took her somewhere around six to eight months before she
*  started feeling anything, she was really worried that it wasn't going to work. But then at eight
*  months in just the pain just went away. And it's continued to get better. And then I sent her down
*  a second time, and I'm going to keep sending her down there. It's just, it's had a pretty profound
*  effect. What was fascinating to me is they do three days of intravenous therapy. And the
*  intravenous therapy has, I don't know if it's just my imagination, but she looks younger,
*  like she looks she looks more vibrant. You know, like when I saw her, she came to my house for
*  Christmas, she looked better. She looked a year younger than she did the last time I saw her.
*  Matthew 14 Yeah, I mean, you know, this is what we would hope that stem cell therapy. Yes. But
*  I remind you of what I said about that original Parkinson's trial for more than 25 years ago.
*  Right for 15 years. We really didn't know that was the one that was affected. Right. Exactly. So
*  only a few people benefited. The people who did benefit benefit enormously, but huge numbers of
*  people had no benefit. Yeah. Now, that is the kind of stage we're in for a lot of stem cell
*  therapies right now. Parkinson's disease is a kind of outlier in the sense that the desired function
*  of the stem cell is really well understood. So what kind of stem cells to introduce into the
*  body and where to introduce them is, you know, not in doubt. Most stem cell therapies are not
*  that far along. So every time anyone gets treated right now, it's still an experiment. And that's
*  okay, up to a point. But it does mean that we're on a learning curve. And it's vital to have the
*  people like Neil, who are administering this therapy to quite a lot of people, to actually
*  not just, you know, live off the stories of high profile people who get good benefits and talk them
*  up, but actually to go out and release the full data, unexplicated, you know, including any negative
*  stuff and including follow up. That's the key thing. Yeah. Because so many therapies in
*  regenerative medicine in general have the potential to be beneficial over the first,
*  you know, a few months to a year or whatever, and then to start having side effects that are
*  detrimental. What have you heard that are detrimental side effects? So, well, of course,
*  the biggest thing that we always have to worry about is cancer. Because I think it's true for
*  a whole bunch of things, you know, telomerase activators and so on. The thing is that aging
*  can in some senses be characterized as a trade off between cancer and everything else. In other
*  words, a huge amount of what goes wrong with the body late in life is as a result of a kind of
*  dialing down of regenerative functions that we actually do naturally have in the body,
*  but which are not as active in older people as they are in younger people. And so, of course,
*  we have to ask why are they less active? And a lot of biologists, including myself, believe that
*  a huge part of that is adaptive. In other words, it is kind of the body recognizing that there is,
*  as time goes on, a progressively higher number of cells in the body that are almost cancerous,
*  and that have to be kind of kept in check in order not to become properly cancerous.
*  Because, of course, cancer is the result of a gradual accumulation of mutations and so on
*  in the cells, right? And so, yes, every time that you are improving regenerative capacity,
*  whether of the cells that you put in or, more importantly, of the cells that are nearby the
*  cells you put in, you are potentially taking a risk of hastening the onset of actual cancer.
*  What is your opinion on the benefits of fasting in that regard?
*  Okay. Let me first of all talk about fasting in relation to cancer, because that is important.
*  People have certainly found that it is a good thing to do, which is somewhat counterintuitive,
*  because in the later stages of cancer, there is, of course, cacaxia, a lot of loss of muscle and so
*  on. But earlier on, it seems that we can slow things down. I mean, cancers are greedy,
*  metabolically. They consume a lot of energy. So, if you are putting a lot, if you are minimizing
*  how many calories you put in, then you have a chance of slowing the cancer down so that
*  therapies may have a better chance. So, that has certainly been found.
*  Let me talk about fasting more generally, though. So, for sure, I mean, it has been known for nearly
*  100 years that if you give mice or rats less food than they would like, then they live longer than
*  they otherwise do. And this is certainly the most reproducible and best studied phenomenon in the
*  whole of the biology of aging. Still, there are mysteries about how it works, but a lot of stuff
*  has been found out. And many of my colleagues, including David, have made their careers by
*  making progress, by discovering insights in that area. The result of that is that we now have
*  something that people have always recognized to be rather important, namely drugs that trick the
*  body into thinking it's fasting when it isn't. These are called calorie restriction memetics.
*  And that's good. That's also a worthwhile thing because, of course, people like eating. And so,
*  it would be useful. Then there are variations on the theme. So, a guy from close to here,
*  UCLA named Walter Longo, sorry, USC named Walter Longo, has been really the pioneer of intermittent
*  fasting, which is basically properly starving 100%, but only for two days a week or something
*  like that. Different people have tried different schedules. And all of these things are pretty
*  interesting in terms of being good for your health. But in terms of increasing your longevity by 30 or
*  40%, the way they do in mice and rats, no way. It turns out, and this is a prediction of evolutionary
*  theory, but it's also been found absolutely clearly in data, that different species react differently
*  to starvation, to fasting, in particular that longer-lived species get less benefit
*  from fasting than shorter-lived species. So, if you do it just right in nematode worms that normally
*  live like three weeks, then you can multiply their lifespan by a factor of five or more.
*  You sure as hell can't do that with a mouse, however you do it. You can get up to maybe 50%,
*  maybe 60% if you really, really work at it. Some of the person you might be able to eat
*  out of a year or two. Yeah, that's right. With dogs it's been tried, you get maybe 10%. With
*  monkeys you get a few percent if you're lucky. That's a bit controversial right now. Why is
*  it a bit controversial? Because there were two studies done, really long, extensive studies,
*  obviously, because monkeys live a long time and they got different results. And so the
*  question is why they get different results. If you look closely at exactly how the experiments
*  were done, then it's pretty easy to see that they got different results because of different
*  methodologies, slightly different methodologies, and that the real answer is somewhere between the
*  two. So yeah. And with dogs you said you get 10%? About that, yeah. This was done with labradors
*  that live 11 years. 11 years. Oh, but isn't that normal for a labrador? That's right. What I'm
*  saying is they got about another year. Oh, they got 10% of 11 years. Oh, I understand. So
*  fasting with human beings you think is, it's interesting, it's something, but it's not going
*  to mimic these biologics and what you believe is on the horizon. Right. And I mean, I'm not against
*  it at all. First of all, as I say, it is generally good for health. You definitely see people getting
*  sick less, regular sickness, like infections and so on. People seem to stay healthier for a bit
*  longer. But in terms of really pushing out the boundaries of these age-related progressive
*  chronic conditions, it's maybe a year or two. There's a few other factors that are taken into
*  consideration when people talk about longevity and health, and those are community, enjoyment,
*  friends, loved ones, satisfaction with what you do for a living. How do you take those into
*  consideration and what do you think is going on with those? Yeah, these things are definitely big.
*  So all of these things, and it goes further than that, it extends to meditation and yoga and so on.
*  Everything that relates to stress is very important in aging. It's even reasonably well
*  understood that when you're in a stressed out state, you synthesize elevated amounts of certain
*  hormones that interact throughout the body and in various ways accelerate the accumulation of
*  these various types of damage I was talking about earlier. So it's no surprise that there's
*  a mind-body relationship there. People often study centenarians, people who live an exceptionally
*  long time. Why do they study them? Obviously because they want to find out what the tricks are.
*  Unfortunately, it's quite frustrating because there's not a lot in common. Some centenarians
*  are a little bit overweight, some centenarians smoke. It's not easy to actually figure out what
*  they've got in common. But there's one thing that almost all centenarians have in common, which is
*  nothing bothers them. It's not necessarily that they have had particularly stressed free lives.
*  The thing is that when they encounter a stressful situation, they cope with it really well.
*  So the hormones, as I say, don't get elevated. Interesting. So the cortisol doesn't rise,
*  adrenaline doesn't spike, they don't freak out. Or at least the spikes are more modest.
*  They don't lose sleep, they can handle it. That's interesting. So it really boils down to the effect
*  that's going on inside the mind and the body. That's how the body's reacting to the stress.
*  Do you meditate yourself?
*  No, no. I'm just chill anyway.
*  Well, you're also satisfied.
*  Well, that's certainly true, as I say.
*  Yeah. So you don't feel the need to?
*  Yeah. At a physical level, I have a very stressful life. I spend my life running around airports
*  and so on, but at a mental level, not at all.
*  Are you doing any exercise? Do you take supplements?
*  Honestly, hauling my way through airports is my exercise.
*  Hauling your way through airports, how often are you flying?
*  10% of the time.
*  Do you just take one of the bags you have to carry rather than a roller bag?
*  I do.
*  Do you, on purpose?
*  Yeah.
*  For extra work?
*  Actually, not for extra work, no. It's just because I can move faster that way without it.
*  Okay.
*  But yeah, certainly the fact that I've actually got some weight on myself is probably good in itself.
*  Yeah. I started carrying a backpack instead of a roller bag. It's just easy to move.
*  Holding on something and dragging it behind me, and I found that there's something,
*  I have a bag that I can stick a laptop in and I can stick all my clothes in. It's just a larger bag.
*  Yeah. I carry two generally. When I'm doing a day trip like today, I only carry my laptop bag,
*  but it's a really cavernous one. So it's pretty heavy. It's got everything in it that I need for
*  a day or could need. And then when I'm traveling a longer trip, I just have one other bag, a sports
*  bag that I'm carrying.
*  Is there anything that you think you should be doing that you're not doing that you maybe
*  would like to plan for in the future?
*  It's hard to say because I do have a lot of freedom about exactly how I spend any particular day.
*  It's more a case of what I would be doing if I didn't have to do the things I'm doing now.
*  Which is obviously doing all this advocacy and so on.
*  Yeah. Have you ever used a sensory deprivation tank?
*  No.
*  No? I'd like you to use that. I'd like to hear your feedback. I have one here.
*  And what would you like my feedback?
*  I just want to know because it was very relaxing.
*  I'm relaxed already.
*  You say. Getting there. See. You know what it is, right? You float.
*  Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
*  It's beautiful. It feels amazing.
*  I'm into sensory deprivation in general. When I'm asleep, I don't like to have any kind of noise
*  or light. One of my bans is staying in hotels which don't have proper blackout curtains.
*  Typically when I'm in a hotel room, I'll unplug the refrigerator.
*  The noise. Yeah. So you basically got it dialed in.
*  I think so.
*  Well, I'm optimistic because you're optimistic. When you tell me three to five years from now,
*  we're possibly looking at some sort of a breakthrough where things start moving into the public eye,
*  where people are really taking into consideration like this is real technology that you should,
*  we should all start implementing on our, particularly on people that are older and ailing.
*  Well, right. I mean, at the moment, even though there are some things in clinical trials,
*  we always have to remember that the most challenging areas are still at an early stage.
*  So that's why I make, and not only do they have to individually get,
*  all the way through clinical trials so that they're safe, but also they have to be combined.
*  Each of these things individually can be applied to the small subset of the population that happen
*  to have early onset diseases arising from maybe congenital acceleration of one particular type
*  of damage. But then to be useful for people who don't have any congenital problems,
*  aging at a normal rate, we've got to actually combine them all. And of course, that's going
*  bound to throw up on unanticipated interactions. So that's why I put this timeframe as far out as
*  17 years, and even then with only 50% probability. But the anticipation is the thing that's where
*  the shit's going to really hit the fan, where there's going to be this enormous turbulence
*  in society arising from the knowledge that this is coming. I, for one, am very excited about living
*  in B500. I think I can get a lot of shit done and learn about myself.
*  You know, people, I think it's, I think it makes no sense to think about what one's going to be
*  doing in the distant future. You know, people, there was one time I was on stage about, I'm going
*  to say five or six years ago, and somebody from the audience for about the thousandth time asked me,
*  you know, how long do you want to live? And I just lost it slightly.
*  I had questions just one more time too often. And so I said, look, okay, I've got a question for you,
*  I said. I said, right, what time do you want to go to the toilet next Sunday?
*  And he looked at me like incredulity and I said, yeah, you haven't the faintest idea why I asked
*  you that question, do you? But it's exactly the same kind of question. You know, you may have an
*  opinion about what time you expect to go to the toilet next Sunday because of habit,
*  but having an opinion about what time you want to go to the toilet is completely crazy because
*  you're going to have better information on the topic nearer the time and you're going to be
*  able to act on that information. It's exactly the same. And also the idea of how long you want to
*  live is going to be irrelevant if they could repair disease and fix all these issues. It's
*  just going to be the quality of life. Precisely. I mean, having an idea of how long you want to live,
*  even stating that the quality of life is going to be like a young adult physically and mentally,
*  you know, it's crazy to have an opinion because it's going to be determined by other stuff.
*  Yes. Well, I'm fascinated by the future in every aspect, technologically with artificial
*  intelligence, with automation, just the way society is shifting. I mean, I'm a very optimistic person
*  in that regard. And I think even the problems, some of the problems that we have socially,
*  I think those are just a result of this shift towards a more aware, more conscious society.
*  I'm very optimistic. I think all those things are good. So I think that the extending lifespan
*  and getting to see these real exponential changes in our culture and in our society and
*  just our way of life, I'm very excited about it. I think it's one of the most intriguing things
*  about being a person is to see how things have shifted. I mean, I've been reading a lot of books
*  lately about Native Americans and how they shifted from the early 1800s to the, you know,
*  21st century, the early 21st century, 200 years later. Things are impossibly different,
*  unimaginably different at the time. If you could talk to them about what life was like
*  200 years ago, it'd be fairly similar. 1620 to 1820, not a lot of difference, you know? But
*  1820 to 2020, good Lord, what is 2220 going to be like? I mean, I just think that we are
*  at the cusp of one of the most spectacular eras in human history. Things are changing so rapidly and
*  so amazingly. Well, of course, the thing that one has to recognize is that we have no particular
*  reason to suppose that they will ever slow down. So you can't really call this one of the cusps.
*  It's just, you know, we're in an exponential scenario and we happen to be noticing it more.
*  Since you started off as a coder, I'm going to wrap this up soon, but I'm going to leave you
*  with this because I'm really fascinated by artificial intelligence. Are you worried at all
*  about artificial intelligence? Do you hear the Elon Musk's and the Sam Harris's of the world that
*  are sounding the alarm, like, hey, don't hit that switch, don't turn this on?
*  I think it's a legitimate question, definitely, whether the progress that we're making might lead
*  to a development, perhaps accidental development, of technology that is so autonomous that it gets
*  out of our control. However, I do think it's very unlikely. I think that the ways in which we have
*  succeeded in making the progress that we have made so far in AI over the past decade especially
*  relies enormously on human-computer interaction. In other words, the machines get their information
*  from us and from the world without which they can't make progress. I don't see that changing
*  really anytime soon. I do still pay some attention to the progress of AI. One of my other good friends,
*  a guy that I knew from way back in my Cambridge days, is the guy who runs DeepMind, which is one
*  of the most high-profile AI companies. I'm definitely excited about what's happening,
*  but no, I'm not particularly apprehensive. However, I do think that it's better to be safe than sorry,
*  and therefore, that what's being done to look at the possibilities of things getting out of control,
*  or indeed of things just being misused by humans, is a very legitimate and valuable area of work.
*  Pete Well, Aubrey, the next time I see you, if it's five years from now,
*  I hope you look younger. I hope the world has changed and everything's groovy,
*  and I appreciate you and I appreciate everything you're doing.
*  Aubrey Well, thank you so much.
*  Please tell people if they're more interested in finding out about what you're doing,
*  what is the website of your organization?
*  Pete Yep, sense.org. That's S for Sugar, E for Elephant, N for November, S for Sugar.org.
*  Aubrey Alright, thank you. Thank you very much.
*  Pete Thank you.
*  Aubrey Bye, everybody.
*  Pete What a roll. That was fun.
