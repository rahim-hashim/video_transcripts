# Joe Rogan Experience #1522 - Rob Lowe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw8dkF-jotk)
*  Oh, here we go. Here we are. What's up, man? It's good to be I was just saying it's good
*  to be in like a proper studio and I've been completely locked down the entire time completely.
*  It's outrageous. We're five months in now. When does it ever thought this? It and if
*  you just said this is what 2020 is going to have. I mean, you wouldn't have left the New
*  Year's party. You would have never believed it. You know, how does this happen? Like,
*  zero war? Like, what what happens? What takes place? And it's funny how easily not easily,
*  but like, it's just yeah, no, this is what we're dealing with. I mean, I guess everybody
*  one has to adapt. So that's the good news. Have you been going to restaurants at all?
*  I've been to probably I've gone out to a restaurant maybe three times. It's have you gone to the
*  ones where they wear the mask and then the shield over their face as well? Yeah, it's
*  like they're going to do welding in the kitchen. So strange. It's but it's better than nothing.
*  So you just sort of adapt. I know. I mean, who knows when it'll I mean, at least some
*  people feel like they're going back to work. I mean, I think we're gonna go back on my
*  show on 9-1-1 Lone Star pre-production in on the 17th. Now, how will they do that? Well,
*  that's the thing is that's a big show. I mean, it's it's not, you know, a game show. It's
*  like, you know, it's adventures and rescues and pyrotechnics and stunt people. It's just
*  huge in scope. So it really is the thing. If we can pull that off, that'll be that'll
*  be good. But I think the plan is one thing that's interesting is just how you run a set
*  is going to change, they tell me. So you'll come in in the morning, everybody will get
*  tested and then everybody's segregated. So you go to the set and the director and the
*  actors will rehearse. That's it. Nobody else there. Then they leave, have to leave. And
*  then the lighting crew will come in and they light alone, just the lighting crew, and then
*  they leave. And then the sort of, you know, the all the production teams get their moment
*  to do what they need to do. But they're doing it alone. Well, they have a test now that
*  the White House is using. And it takes 20 minutes. It's an actual test, you go there,
*  so you could find instantaneously. See what we're doing one here, the one that you got
*  is an antibody test. That takes 10 minutes. And it shows active antibodies, which means
*  you got the disease five, six days ago or whatever, and your body's fighting it off.
*  It's currently in your system. And it also shows another indicator whether or not you
*  fought it off a long time ago. And then there's the swab. The swab takes 24 to 48 hours, depending
*  on the lab. And then there's real worry and concern like, are you contagious during that
*  time? Like if you just got it today, can you give it to someone today? They don't know.
*  So until this thing happens with the White House, the 20 minute one that they have, until
*  that's like nationwide, we're fucked. You know, we're kind of we're in a weird situation
*  where everybody has to be really careful. Yeah. And you know, it's funny, I it's funny.
*  I have no issue wearing masks. I don't really get that that that thing that people I mean,
*  I get the free the the freedom. It's definitely better than not going out. Yeah. And listen,
*  I mean, I feel way safer wearing it. Way safer. And, you know, celebrities should be thrilled
*  to wear masks. Yeah, right. I mean, you know, listen, now Leonardo DiCaprio can go out completely,
*  you know, with even better disguises. You'd be amazed at how much people recognize you,
*  though, even with a mask on, especially as soon as you start talking, they'll they'll
*  recognize you in particular for you, your voice. Everybody knows your voice. So you
*  can't get in an elevator, you know. But I'm a fan of the bandana. I like feeling like
*  a bandit. But doesn't all the bad shit come underneath the bandana? I don't think you
*  have to be sealed at the bottom. A bandana, I do not think is for you. I think it's for
*  other people. And then the droplets, if you're getting droplets, I don't think you're swooping
*  them under. I think you are breathing it through. What am I a doctor? I know you're sounding
*  good. You're like, you know, you're the Fauci of the ring. Thank you. The Fauci of the octagon.
*  I don't have one of those N95 masks, though. I have hundreds of them. Do you? Are they
*  the best? You know, here's what I'll tell you what they are. They're the hardest to
*  breathe in. Like they are the ones that when you put on your, you definitely notice that
*  you're sucking wind. But yeah, my wife was all over that. Like if there's anything to
*  be bought on Amazon at any time for any excuse, she's the fucking maven. So the minute this
*  happens, she's bought every M95 mask stockpile. One click is very addictive. It is. It's like,
*  maybe I do need 50 boxes of toothpaste. It's right there. It's right there. Why wouldn't
*  I do it? I'll find a place to put it. I'll take that. So when your show comes back, people
*  will still be allowed to go home though and go places. Yeah, I haven't heard any talk
*  of, you know, sort of quarantining or 14 day. I haven't heard any of that stuff. Although
*  I have friends who have gone to Europe to do big movies and they've had to do that.
*  Yeah, I've heard that. Like they keep you in a hotel. You can't leave the hotel. Everybody
*  who works in the thing has to only hang out with everybody that's on the project. Here's
*  what I don't understand. So the NBA is doing the bubble thing, right? Where they all live
*  in like a commune, right? A glorified Disney-esque commune. But the NFL isn't going to do it,
*  apparently. Yeah, it's too hard to get the hoes in there. I was thinking, you know, chicken
*  wings. It's hard to get. When you want those chicken wings, you've got to go out to get
*  them. Yes. When you do. Yeah, you've got to, whatever you want. If you need something,
*  very difficult. What you're going to do. Are you a fan of the baseball with the crowd noise?
*  No, I'm not a fan of fake noise. I hate that some cars do that. You know, some cars with
*  turbocharged engines, they put fake engine noise through the speakers. Oh, Jesus. Exactly.
*  I never knew that. All my illusions are shattered. I think BMW does it. What? Yeah. I'm sorry
*  to say. No. Are the speakers on the outside of the car or on the inside? It's through
*  the stereo speakers. Even if the speakers turned off? Yeah, it's an option that you
*  have to turn off. You have to go into the settings and turn off. See if you can find
*  that. Oh, no. I have a BMW. It's outside. It's like, it's enhanced sound. Maybe it's
*  not for your model. I'm pretty sure they do it for the M4, though. Yeah, it's one of the
*  primary complaints of legitimate auto journalists. The real automobile enthusiasts hate it.
*  Of course they fucking hate it. This is like you told me that Santa Claus doesn't exist.
*  It's not necessary either. I have a Tesla and it doesn't make any sound and it's still
*  awesome. Yeah. Oh, that thing is. The only problem with the Tesla is I feel like I'm
*  every television development executive. Right. You know what I mean? It's like what the Armani
*  suit was in the 80s. It means I'm in show business. Yeah, it's definitely a signal.
*  You're letting everybody know you're also really concerned about the environment. You're
*  a really good person. But on the other side of this, you also have one of the most badass
*  pieces of equipment. Would it kill them though to do a luxurious interior? Would it kill
*  them? Well, there's a company. What is that about? That's a good question. I think it's
*  just first of all, it's an American made company. Everything's made here. And I think that scaling
*  everything up has been a real problem. It's been a real problem meeting the demand. And
*  I think they just kind of came out with like a reasonable interior and put it together.
*  But there's a company called, what is that company called? Again, they make a car called
*  the Apex. They essentially, they're right next to the Tesla factory in California and
*  they'll take your Tesla, they bring it over there and they soup it up. They put a wider
*  track. They widen the fenders. They put better suspension. That's it right there. S Apex.
*  So they take it and they completely redo the interior. Yeah, dope. Carbon fiber. Oh, okay,
*  there's an interior. That's a car interior. Yes, yes. I love that you love cars. It's
*  one of my favorite subjects. I mean, I love them and I know nothing about them. It's like
*  I also kind of like watches, but I don't know any, like I just know what I like. Like the
*  movements and stuff. I don't know that shit. Those dorks. Is it the H65 movement? Is the
*  bezel infused with whatever the fuck. I barely thought they know the word bezel. What's the
*  name of the company again? Unplugged Performance. So they'll do anything in the interior you
*  want. They'll do diamond stitched leather. They'll do carbon fiber. They'll replace all
*  the plastic with carbon fiber. You're a car guy. I was impressed with the car collection
*  coming in here. Were you ever tempted to get one of those tricked out escalate, the
*  factories right around the corner from here where they, the escalator was like a living
*  room. Like I went in there and saw the one they were making for Tom Brady and it was,
*  it's like the interior of a, of a private plane, but in an escalate. Oh, okay. So they do like
*  gut it and then just redo it like some very swank. Yeah, it's like a living room. It's
*  literally a living room. What I've been looking at lately is earth roamers. Do you know what
*  an earth roamer is? An earth roamer. Yes. I have been, uh, I've been an apocalypse guy
*  for quite a while. So you're, you're in your, all your glory. I have a, sure. I told you
*  so a moment. Well, not necessarily. I'm not like a prepper or anything like that, but
*  I'm like, if the shit is the fan. What's the difference between a prepper? I don't have
*  enough food. Okay. I have a free, I have freezers filled with elk meat and stuff like that.
*  So I kind of have enough food, but if the power goes out, I'm kind of fucked. That's
*  an earth roamer. Those motherfuckers you can live in and they can drive like a thousand
*  miles plus. Yeah. And they do the interior. Well, there's different scales, but some of
*  them go up to like $1.5 million and the interior is insanity. An earth roamer. Yeah. I'm taking
*  notes. I literally think about, I am literally taking notes. You can go anywhere with these.
*  They also have an air suspension that will automatically level your vehicle. So like,
*  say if you're on some fucked up like kind of terrain, that's not level, it'll level
*  it out so you can sleep well. The interior is like the interior of a really nice tour
*  bus, televisions, satellite radio, audio, internet. Who makes, I mean, it's a company
*  that's literally just earth roamer. They make the whole thing. They start, the base is a
*  very large Ford pickup truck. They'd take like a huge diesel pickup truck and then they
*  put this insane cabin in the back of it and there's a bunch of different levels that they
*  do it. You know, you have like a reasonable level for like one person if you like camping
*  and then you could literally bring your whole family and you're living like you're in a
*  private jet. Wow. And it can drive over everything. That's the other thing. It's like a legitimate
*  off-road vehicle. You can go over a fucking mountain in that thing. Well, you know, in
*  Santa Barbara where I live, we had these terrible fires and floods and mudslides too. Yeah, the
*  mudslides killed 23 people. I knew someone who died. Yeah, as did I. Crazy. Crazy. She's
*  in her house. Yeah, these people, so you imagine you go to sleep at night. You know that there's
*  going to be rain, whatever, and you go to sleep at night and next thing you know your
*  house is obliterated. Yeah, instantly. The sheriffs came to us to tell us about different
*  evacuation zones and I said, I know all these guys really well, so just level with me. What's
*  like the worst thing that's going to happen? Like the absolute doomsday scenario you guys
*  were worried about and they're like, well, we're worried about the entire mountain going
*  all the way to the freeway. I'm like, great, thanks for sharing. We're going to be fine.
*  And that's exactly what happened. And what it taught me was you truly cannot comprehend
*  like the power of nature. Like when people used to say, California could fall off into
*  the ocean. You go, that's not good. I'm telling you, it could. We could wake up one day and
*  be, you know, Lincoln Boulevard and Santa Monica? Yeah, that's the ocean now. You'd
*  be like, oh, bullshit. That's nothing. I'm telling you, based on what I lived through,
*  the mind, like it's an intersection I try by every day. If you said, okay, tomorrow
*  night at midnight, there's going to be a 45 foot wall right here of debris, of homes,
*  of boulders the size of a semi truck cab. You'd be like, bullshit, that's fucking important.
*  From where? Where are the boulders coming from? Where's all that? That's what happened.
*  You can't imagine it. Now, were you in your house when that happened? I was in Vegas with
*  my wife. My son Matthew was home. He thought he heard the most radical thunder he'd ever
*  heard in his life. How old is your son? He was 22 at the time. He's like a prepping,
*  he's an outdoorsman. If there was any one of the family to be home, it would have been
*  Matthew. That's what I would have wanted there. Also, he thought it was daylight. He woke
*  up and thought it was already heat overslept because the fires from all of the propane
*  explosions had lit the sky up so it looked like daylight. Then he called me and I got
*  on the scanner, the police scanner and the stuff that you could hear. It was just unbelievable.
*  It was pandemonium. Yeah, it's such a beautiful area, Santa Barbara,
*  Montecito. It's so gorgeous because of those mountains, but that's also what makes it vulnerable
*  if there's a fire, right? Because all the stuff that kind of holds the mountain together
*  and keeps the erosion from happening all gets burnt up and then a strong rain.
*  That was the problem. We had a once in at least a hundred year fire. The area behind
*  our house hadn't burned in over a hundred years. A once in probably maybe they think
*  a thousand year rain event all within six weeks of each other. One of the things that
*  was fascinating to me was the amount of ash because I went on a hike afterwards and there
*  was at least six inches of ash. When you see the astronauts footprints on the moon, that's
*  what it looked like all as far as you could see in the mountains around Santa Barbara.
*  Then when we got that rain with the ash, it created a viscous lubricant that just pried
*  these boulders out. That's one of the reasons why these massive, massive, massive boulders
*  that you would think would be soldered into the earth's core, which is like boop and just
*  washed out. It's so hard to imagine because if you drive
*  up the 101 and you see those beautiful hills, you just see beautiful hills. What that is
*  is evidence that the earth is moving. That's what those hills are. You're safer in Kansas,
*  but then again you're not because then there's tornadoes.
*  There's no free lunch, man. Oh, look at this.
*  Yeah, I know that house. It's crazy when you see that six feet of
*  mud literally poured into people's homes. Just like the people that were on the bottom floor
*  of the house were just destroyed immediately. How many people died in this?
*  23. What a crazy way to go too.
*  Yeah. I mean in the stories, everybody's story is more tragic than look at that.
*  Well, one thing that this pandemic taught a lot of people is that what you think of
*  as being static and unchanging, that the world that we live in is basically pretty stable.
*  It's not a small event and it's not small, but a virus that kills less than 1% of the
*  population can completely obliterate the world as you know it. That's minor in comparison
*  to a solar flare or an asteroid impact or a super volcano. If Yellowstone goes, that's
*  the real concern. That's another thing I used to think. That's
*  the stuff I watch at night by the fireplace. It's my ancient alien shit. That's not really
*  happening and now based on what I've experienced, anything could happen.
*  Well Yellowstone definitely could go. They say it goes every six to eight hundred thousand
*  years and the last time it went was more than six hundred thousand years ago.
*  Can you imagine?
*  It would obliterate everybody in the continent. There'd be no one left. The people in like
*  maybe Africa, some in New Zealand, some people would survive, but they would experience nuclear
*  damage. The temperature would radically reduce. The entire sky would be filled with ash. It's
*  a super volcano. Those caldera super volcanoes, they've exploded throughout history and killed
*  massive numbers of human beings. They think that there was one in Indonesia somewhere
*  around 60 to 70 thousand years ago that killed off most of the population of the world and
*  left as few as 7,000 human beings.
*  Really?
*  That's just 70,000 years ago.
*  Well you've had like Graham Hitchcock and people on it.
*  Graham Hancock.
*  Hancock, right?
*  Yeah, and Randall Carlson.
*  Is that part of that narrative too?
*  Well they've concentrated on asteroid impacts and particularly the asteroid impacts that
*  are proven now that they believe ended the ice age and they also believe restarted civilization
*  because they think that there was some incredibly complex civilizations that we're not totally
*  aware of other than some of the structures they left behind like Gobekli Tepe and some
*  of the ancient Egyptian structures. But there's a clear indication that something happened
*  both from an archaeological perspective and also from a geologist perspective when they
*  do these core samples they find that somewhere around between, somewhere in the 12,000 years
*  ago range there was a massive impact and all over the world because they find this Tritonite
*  which is this nuclear glass everywhere. They also find iridium which is really common in
*  space but not very common on earth.
*  And it's a level they see in the core samples.
*  It's a very consistent level and they find that nuclear glass. That's the same glass
*  like when the Trinity project, when they first blew up the first nuclear bomb. That's one
*  of the things that they found was this nuclear glass and it's just this incredible force
*  that causes the sand to turn into glass and they find this all over the world at around
*  12,000 years.
*  And there's also, there's a lot of awareness today of all the near earth objects and when
*  earth in its orbit comes in contact with these consistent near earth objects and that something
*  probably hit earth in multiple places, like more than one object somewhere in that range
*  and ended the ice age. I think it happened twice. The speculation is that it happened
*  somewhere around 12,000 and maybe again somewhere around 10,000 years ago.
*  It's crazy.
*  It is crazy. I love all that stuff. I live for that shit.
*  I love it too. I live for it but I don't because I don't want it to happen again.
*  No!
*  So it's like I get excited but then I don't ever, the worst is if I listen to Graham Hancock
*  and Rondell Carlson and then I smoke pot and go to sleep.
*  Oh, then the head. You should record those dreams.
*  Oh, yeah if you could.
*  You should write them as teleplays.
*  Yeah, that's terrifying. It's just, we're so vulnerable. I mean we're vulnerable period,
*  right? I mean I'm 52. How old are you now?
*  56.
*  You'll look great.
*  Thank you. You too, sir. You too.
*  But we're almost dead, let's be honest. How much time we got left? If everything goes
*  great.
*  No, no, we're gonna live forever. We're gonna have that pill that's gonna be announced next week.
*  That might be the worst thing that could happen. Like you might want to go, you know,
*  quietly in your sleep rather than live for 500 years and see the horrors that humanity turns into.
*  That too and I don't want to like if my body breaks down. I'm so physical. I love doing my stuff.
*  I don't think I'd be one of those people like, you know what? His mind is so sharp though.
*  It's like, well, fuck, that's great. Meanwhile, the guy can't fucking walk.
*  Yeah.
*  He can't, you know, it's like I want to be able to do my thing.
*  Yes, yes.
*  I want a sharp mind. Let's stipulate that.
*  But what do you do to maintain yourself? What do you do to keep the machine working?
*  Well, the number one thing was, you know, I stopped drinking years and years and years ago.
*  How many years?
*  30.
*  Oh, so you got way ahead of the game.
*  So I'm way ahead. So I don't do any of that.
*  Wow, that's a lot of discipline.
*  But it's not though, because the minute you realize your discipline has nothing to do with it,
*  that's the only way you can do it.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Because the whole point is like, I can't. If I had one, let's say you broke out that,
*  because I was like beer, beer was good. Well, there it is. What do you got there?
*  Whiskey.
*  Whiskey was never my thing. I'd be OK. If it were tequila, that'd be a different thing.
*  And also it was the 80s. So if you had a kamikaze, remember those drinks?
*  Yeah, I do remember those.
*  You know what I'm saying? Like it would go, then I'd be like, you know what would be really good
*  to get would be some Coke. That would be great.
*  To balance it out.
*  Yeah, just to balance out.
*  And you know that.
*  It's no big deal.
*  You get no big deal. And it's good for you.
*  If you get the Rockstar Coke, that stuff's not even bad for you.
*  That's what I'm saying. It's not even bad for you. Mick Jagger does it. OK?
*  Look at Keith Richards. He's fine.
*  Look at Keith Richards. Look at Jack Nicholson. Look at, I mean.
*  Those guys are doing great.
*  Look at them. They're the biggest stars in the world.
*  Jack Nicholson is fat too.
*  How bad could it be?
*  How bad could it be?
*  It's good for your memory.
*  Probably. And it's really good if you want to talk a lot.
*  And successful people do it.
*  A lot of successful people do it.
*  And it's not addicting.
*  No!
*  They just enjoy it.
*  Yes. So that was what we thought. You know, that's what, you know, that's just the Gordon Gekko era.
*  And then. And then the Hounds of Hell will be released.
*  Once I got that good little concoction going, that good little mixy mixerson.
*  Well, it had to be hard to be a young, really famous, really good looking guy
*  during the age of no internet.
*  And, you know, the world was a wild place.
*  I mean, you were really famous in the 80s.
*  I wouldn't. I wouldn't trade it for anything.
*  I mean, you know, all of it, look, all the mistakes that I made,
*  all the things that I learned got me to where I am today.
*  And I could not be happier.
*  And I needed I needed some fucking comeuppance.
*  And I needed some of that humbling and stuff on the other side of it is like,
*  what's the point of being fucking famous today?
*  Really? I don't know if there's a point.
*  I know, right?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, forget the lack of privacy, the lack of like crazy fun, which you can't have.
*  Right.
*  Everybody's lying in wait.
*  I saw an article written about Leonardo DiCaprio.
*  And it was just about how he dates young girls and how gross it is
*  that he's dating girls.
*  Twenty five.
*  Like twenty five is a woman.
*  You fuck.
*  What is wrong?
*  He's a good looking man.
*  He's wealthy and happy and successful.
*  Oh, my God.
*  He dates someone who's young and vibrant.
*  There must be something wrong with him.
*  Meanwhile, if a woman does it, nobody gives a shit.
*  They celebrate her.
*  You go, Kate Beckinsdale.
*  You go take those 21 year olds down.
*  That's right.
*  Rope them, wrangle them.
*  Rope them and go.
*  Send them off.
*  Kick them in the ass and pack their lunch and send them off.
*  It should be equal opportunity everywhere.
*  That's not though.
*  When it's a woman, they look at it like she's just she's doing her thing.
*  She's having a good time.
*  But a man, it's like he's abusing his power.
*  That Leonardo has power over those young ladies.
*  I figure like if you're if you're, you know, Leo or Bieber or any of those like young like,
*  you know, like this is like what you're part of coming of age.
*  Yes.
*  Figuring is figuring out what you want in life.
*  And you know, when you do that, you're going to do weird shit, good shit, bad shit.
*  Well, that's, you know, whenever everybody would if anybody would try to judge someone
*  like that, like Bieber in particular, right, because he was really, really young when he
*  got famous.
*  I mean, it's insane.
*  And you know, that whole thing, that that theory that whatever, however old you are,
*  when you get famous, that that like freezes you and carbonite emotionally and and intellectually.
*  Well, that makes sense with child stars, right?
*  Anybody.
*  I mean, yes, but anyway, it's also the thing of like, if you ever notice that before like
*  you get famous, the people who were famous to you then.
*  Fast forward 100 years or whatever, and like maybe they haven't done as much and you have.
*  But when you meet them, you think they're the most famous, crazy, successful person.
*  It's the same.
*  Yeah, it's the same type of thing.
*  If I were to meet, you know, Dr. Smith from Lost in Space.
*  I'd be like, no fucking way.
*  Doctors.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  So it's funny how time.
*  I met Lee Majors.
*  I was in my glory.
*  I was like, it's a six million dollar man.
*  I can't believe it.
*  He's real.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Cheech and Chong.
*  When I met those guys, I was like, I can't believe they're real.
*  You can't believe I'm meeting them.
*  Yeah.
*  You get you get frozen in your own your own perspective.
*  Well, when you get older and you become famous, very few people can have this conversation,
*  right?
*  But when you get famous and you meet famous people, to me, it's still weird.
*  Like when I met you today, I was like, huh, hello, Rob Lowe.
*  I've seen you in movies, but I'm more normal with it than when I was young.
*  When I was young and I would meet, like I remember the first time I was on the set of
*  News Radio and I met Phil Hartman.
*  I was so weirded out.
*  I was like, he's right there.
*  This is great.
*  Cause I hadn't met a lot of famous people back then, only like a small handful.
*  And so to be like working with him and sit and he's sitting there.
*  I'm like, I've seen you on TV.
*  By the way, how great was Phil?
*  He was amazing.
*  I had my scariest, one of my scariest professional moments involved Phil Hartman.
*  I was, I was hosting the show on Saturday Night Live and fill in, fill out a character called Mace
*  that he did, reoccurring character.
*  And Mace was a hard-bitten convict and he lived in it.
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously he was serving life and, you know, so whenever they had like, you know, pretty
*  boy hosts, they would throw, of course me into a cell with Mace.
*  Hey, turn around there chicken legs.
*  You said that was, that was like the predicate of the, and I just remember apropos of nothing.
*  It was the week that the Lombada dance was a big deal.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  That tells you how long ago it was.
*  I forgot about that.
*  Yeah.
*  So, so Mace and I were doing the Lombada in a prison cell and the whole sketch built towards
*  a, a, a punch line.
*  And for whatever reason, I blew the setup line.
*  Like, like blue blew it.
*  Like there's no, there's now no end.
*  Oh look at that, there we go.
*  Look at him.
*  Hey, look at you chicken legs.
*  And so there was no, so I had to ad lib something really, really, really, really quickly.
*  It felt like time stretched out and his eyes got huge and I ad libbed something and it
*  worked and it got a really big laugh.
*  And I think that that's when what sort of sealed my relationship with Lorne Michaels,
*  because I was able to, I came back backstage and was like, hmm, you're really Houdini,
*  aren't you?
*  That's gotta be terrifying to do that show, to do it live.
*  It's the best.
*  If I could, if I could have been a not ready for prime time player, I would have, I mean,
*  that would have been the dream.
*  I think that's the dream.
*  How much preparation do you have to do for that show?
*  Like how many times do you rehearse one of those sketches?
*  Well, being, what people don't really realize about being a host is it's the host show.
*  You can take as much control over it as you want and most people don't.
*  I, just being stupid and naive, did and always did and sat in on the writers all night,
*  write all night with all the different writers going from room to room.
*  It was like fucking heaven.
*  But I was an SNL nerd.
*  So it was like, and then you do the dress rehearsal, of course, right before air.
*  And it's a full show.
*  It's exactly the same show, full audience.
*  It's the whole thing.
*  And then they cut things or not.
*  One of my favorite things that got cut and Will Ferrell and I played oncologists who would
*  deliver the bad news that people had stage four cancer, but only with our mouths full of food.
*  So we like, that was, that was it.
*  It was, yeah, he'd be like, oh yeah, I'm sorry.
*  I'm reading chili.
*  Woo, woo.
*  This is hot.
*  It's burning the roof of my mouth.
*  Sorry.
*  So sorry.
*  You have stage four cancer.
*  Oh, ow.
*  So hot and spicy.
*  That was the, that was the total predicate of, of the sketch.
*  That is a weird.
*  It was like so weird and so dark.
*  It made it to air.
*  I mean, to dress.
*  Wow.
*  Really crazy.
*  It must've been a rough week.
*  It's a rough week.
*  I don't think cancer's funny.
*  No, I guess you got a point there.
*  Phil hated the competitive aspect of the show because he said that people were just mean to
*  each other.
*  That's one of the things that he enjoyed about sitcoms is that everybody was kind of working
*  together.
*  He said one of the things about when you do SNL, everyone's battling to get their sketch on.
*  So they would sort of sabotage each other and they would kind of, there was a lot of like
*  backstabby shit going on and he didn't like it.
*  And he was really hesitant like to be friendly with people on the set.
*  Like when he first got on the sitcom, it took a while for him to loosen up and realize
*  others is a different thing because that environment was every man for himself.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  Ensembles are funny that way.
*  Like there is an element of teamwork.
*  It's like any team.
*  There's an element of teamwork that's intrinsic and you want and it's great and hopefully
*  it's there.
*  But then there's that element of competitiveness even with your sort of band of brothers.
*  But that gets toxic in a hurry with the wrong culture.
*  And maybe the wrong people in it.
*  But SNL, it's like it is what it is.
*  There's only so many slots for sketches and there are only so many people writing.
*  And the best is when people try to tank them in the read through.
*  Like you read all of them on Wednesday, a big huge stack of them.
*  And people will like laugh really, really hard at their own stuff or like roll their
*  eyes.
*  It's fun to watch.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's basically what he's talking about.
*  That always made me really uncomfortable.
*  The fake producer laugh.
*  When you'd be doing like the third run through and they'd be like, ha ha ha ha.
*  You're dead.
*  But people don't even know what we're talking about.
*  So like when you do a table read.
*  We've done the most unrelatable podcast ever.
*  Just now.
*  It's been great.
*  Famous and young and good looking.
*  And doomsday prepping and Earth romers.
*  Yes, this is great.
*  There's nobody quite like a man of the people Joe Rogan and Rob Lowe podcast.
*  Let's face it.
*  When you do a run through, folks, you act if you do a sitcom, you act out the show
*  and they want the actors to feel like what they're doing is funny because there's nothing
*  weirder than doing something with no audience and not hearing any laughter at all.
*  So the producers would laugh, but they would do this fake laugh and it would throw you
*  off so hard because it's like all you could do.
*  It's jarring.
*  You're like, oh, yeah, so phony.
*  It's I I did a sitcom when I was little like I was 15.
*  It was it was it was so long ago that there were only 62 shows on television.
*  Period.
*  Holy shit.
*  62.
*  That was not not 62 channels.
*  62 shows.
*  62 shows.
*  By the way, how do you think I remember that there were six because we were number 62.
*  We were we were literally the lowest rated show on television.
*  What was it called?
*  An A New Kind of Family might add something to that exciting title.
*  That makes you just I just sit up and take notice.
*  Don't you?
*  A new kind.
*  What kind of family is it?
*  It's a new kind.
*  Oh, well, I'm going to watch then.
*  What did they mean by a new kind?
*  It was a revolutionary concept at the time that it was two divorced women pooling their
*  resources.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at you.
*  And I I'm sprouting a wonderful Karen Carpenter.
*  Look at that hair, bro.
*  Karen Carpenter.
*  Look at the wings.
*  I know.
*  Was this your first acting project on television?
*  Yeah, I was 15.
*  Wow.
*  So you were you never had a normal life?
*  Not really.
*  So so so the new kind of family is bad.
*  It was bad.
*  And it was opposite 60 Minutes, which was the number one show.
*  And by the way, it was so horribly rated, we would get 19 million people watching.
*  That's crazy.
*  It was it was a disaster.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Isn't that insane?
*  Wow.
*  That's amazing.
*  19 million.
*  That would be the number one show on television today.
*  Oh, there's nothing that even comes close.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Isn't that amazing?
*  That was a huge disaster.
*  19 million people.
*  Wow.
*  I'm the king of the new normal.
*  Like I'm on shows that get bad ratings that then become the new normal.
*  Like like they they said, I can't believe it.
*  It just in like I'm just right there at those thresholds.
*  You're in and you're out.
*  You could say that to someone and not say what ranking it was and say when I was 15,
*  I was on a show that had 19 million people watching it.
*  They'd be like, holy shit.
*  What was it?
*  I know.
*  It's the biggest show ever.
*  Yeah.
*  What is like a number one show today?
*  Like what is the top shows like Modern Family is that number one?
*  Like what's the number one sitcom today?
*  Would have been well, Big Bang has been off for what a year?
*  Or two years.
*  It would definitely be Big Bang and they'd get like I think eight million.
*  I think was what it was.
*  And that's it's shocking.
*  Well somewhere on Netflix are popping up now.
*  Right.
*  That's the problem.
*  Netflix won't tell you shit.
*  They don't tell you nothing.
*  They say, well, you're doing great.
*  Yeah.
*  Or they don't tell you.
*  They don't tell you.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they cancel you.
*  Yeah.
*  They like you.
*  They say we're really happy.
*  Like what does that mean?
*  We're really, really happy.
*  We're really happy.
*  And like how happy?
*  Yeah.
*  No one knows.
*  Really happy.
*  There's a lot of guesswork involved.
*  That's insane though.
*  That's so many people and it was the last rated show.
*  Crazy.
*  The last rated show.
*  And then they figured they shut us down to rejigger it because they figured they could
*  make it better somehow and stop the audience slide.
*  And we came back and that the other family had been replaced.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  They replaced it without saying anything.
*  And made it an African American family figuring that that would be more interesting
*  for the storytelling or what have you.
*  And same name?
*  No, they at least played different people.
*  NCIS and it gets 15 million.
*  Wow.
*  And that's number one.
*  That's the number one show.
*  Number one by a long shot.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  So when we came back and had the new cast member, the daughter was Janet Jackson, which
*  was fun.
*  Okay.
*  So you were still on it?
*  I was still on it.
*  Yeah.
*  And so Janet was all of like 12 or 13 and acting.
*  She was your sister?
*  She played the other.
*  She was in the other family.
*  The other family.
*  Sharing house.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So there was two families and one was African American and one was your family.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it was.
*  That was the change that the network made over a week.
*  And they didn't tell anybody?
*  No, they just, you just turned it on one week and no, why would they do that?
*  Oh, I love network executives.
*  There are people that are making creative decisions that have never been creative in
*  their fucking life and it's amazing.
*  And they're out there pushing buttons and pulling strings and.
*  No, Aaron Sorkin tells a great story about the pilot of the West wing, which is sort
*  of, it's, it's a, I mean, he wrote a great script, so it's one of the great pilots and
*  you know, and there's a through line of refugees from Cuba braving all odds on
*  rickety boats to come to America for America's promise.
*  And that's sort of a thread that's playing through it.
*  And so in the White House, we're talking about it and president Bartlett talks about
*  it in a way to inspire people.
*  And it's really, really beautiful.
*  And the network was like, listen, we love it.
*  We think the script is great, but we think at the end that the characters need to get
*  into a boat and go to Cuba and pull them out of the water.
*  Don't you just know that's true with your network?
*  Cause you don't just know that like.
*  Oh my God.
*  Cause really all you guys are doing is talking about it.
*  I mean, don't you think it's more dramatic if it's actually on the wall and you know,
*  you want to see those people pulled out.
*  You know, we think the script's pretty good the way it is.
*  What does Sarkin say to this?
*  He didn't do it.
*  Thank God.
*  Take deep breaths.
*  He never took a network note.
*  Not once.
*  Wow.
*  That's why I was good.
*  There was never a representative for the network ever on the set.
*  Ever.
*  Not once.
*  Ever.
*  That's very fortunate.
*  News radio, the show that I was on with Phil wasn't successful and it was great show though.
*  We were number 88th in the ratings and my friend Lou Morton, he was one of the writers
*  and every week he would come in with a new t-shirt on where he would write the number
*  on the shirt.
*  Cause we moved around like nine times.
*  We were always in there and this was pre-internet.
*  So you had to look at TV Guide to find out when news radio was on.
*  Jesus.
*  You know, it's like one night we're Tuesday and then we're Sunday.
*  And so he shows up with a t-shirt on that said 88.
*  I'm like, fucking 88.
*  He's like, 88.
*  I'm like, 88.
*  We're the 88th show.
*  Jesus.
*  I was 62.
*  Yeah, but 88 was like a million people watching back then.
*  It was not.
*  It's not.
*  It's not.
*  Good.
*  It's not 19 million.
*  And see, but look at all, it led you to where you are today.
*  That's the thing is all that stuff leads somebody if they're paying attention to where you want to be.
*  If you keep moving.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't be stuck and you can't be scared.
*  Yes.
*  You cannot be stuck and scared.
*  That's the thing about show business, right?
*  It's like this weird world of I wonder how this is going to be received.
*  I wonder how this is going to work.
*  Then you're fucked.
*  You're done though.
*  Once you get into that head, you're done.
*  Yeah.
*  Do your best.
*  And if it doesn't work, shrug your shoulders.
*  Move on.
*  Keep moving.
*  Yeah.
*  If they let you.
*  Yeah.
*  If they let you.
*  That's the weird one, right?
*  When you like watch a movie and you're like, oh, where the fuck did that guy go?
*  Like who's the guy from the mummy?
*  What the fuck's his name?
*  Brendan Fraser.
*  Yes.
*  That guy.
*  Fucking guy was huge.
*  Oh, but Brendan Fraser crashed my Saturday Night Live closing.
*  You know, at the end they go, good night everybody.
*  This has been great.
*  Thanks for watching.
*  And everybody's there.
*  He showed up and was screaming the name of his movie that was opening that weekend.
*  Bedazzled.
*  No.
*  Bedazzled.
*  No.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  What's happening?
*  Who are you?
*  Why are you?
*  Brendan Fraser?
*  What are you doing here?
*  Bedazzled.
*  Don't know.
*  To this day, I don't know what it was about.
*  Maybe that's what sunk him.
*  Bedazzled.
*  Maybe that's what did it.
*  Could have been.
*  That mentality.
*  Like that's not a healthy mindset.
*  I think what happened probably is they were going to work him into a sketch that got cut.
*  To promote bedazzled.
*  Probably some studio shit.
*  Some back room, smoke-filled room shit.
*  And then he was like, well, I'm going to go out there.
*  And he's probably a little drunk.
*  I'm going to yell bedazzled anyway.
*  Damn.
*  Bedazzled.
*  But that guy was a giant movie star.
*  He was huge.
*  Massive.
*  Huge.
*  And the mummy was massive.
*  Massive.
*  Massive.
*  I just watched it.
*  I told you me and my family watched Tommy Boy.
*  No.
*  Yes, we did.
*  We went on, we were doing family movie night because of the quarantine.
*  We watched almost every night.
*  We watched a new movie.
*  I watched all the Adam Sandler movies.
*  Watched a shitload of Eddie Murphy movies.
*  We watched the mummy.
*  Watched a couple of the mummies.
*  And we watched Tommy Boy.
*  How did Tommy Boy stand up?
*  Fucking holds up.
*  Does it?
*  Holds up.
*  Funny movie, man.
*  Funny movie.
*  That's awesome.
*  God damn Chris Farley was good.
*  Bro.
*  He was and a great actor.
*  Among all my regrets about Chris's passing was where he would have gone as an actor.
*  Because he was cute.
*  As Spade.
*  Spade's the same.
*  Their acting in that movie, forget the funny, which is great.
*  But like their like legitimate acting moments in that movie.
*  Yes.
*  And I think that's why it has the staying power.
*  Chris was really going to develop into a real serious actor.
*  A good one, I think.
*  He was such a fucking powerhouse.
*  When he would go ape shit.
*  Look at you guys.
*  Look at those two idiots.
*  I like the part in the movie where Spade looks at me and goes, hey, Lee Harvey.
*  My hair does look like Lee Harvey Oswald.
*  He was awesome, man.
*  That's the cow tipping scene, which I pitched to the writers.
*  They had never heard of it.
*  It made it into the movie.
*  Who was your mom slash girlfriend again?
*  Bo Derek.
*  That's right.
*  Well, that was a great thing because she's Bo Derek and her husband John,
*  famous John Derek, was very protective of her.
*  She hadn't worked in a long time.
*  He made her cut all her hair off the day before she showed up on the set of Tommy Boy.
*  What?
*  We thought we were getting Bo Derek from 10 with the hair.
*  She showed up with hair that's basically my length now because John made her do it.
*  Why did he make her do it?
*  You can do the math.
*  He was like, I want to keep you up in standing as riding horses with me.
*  I don't need you to be a movie star again.
*  But she was so lovely.
*  She's the best.
*  She's a really smart, really smart, just great woman.
*  I got to kiss Bo Derek.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  I know for people who don't know like what she was in 10.
*  Oh my God.
*  She was the original white girl with cornrows when it was okay.
*  You couldn't get canceled for that.
*  But yeah, she would have been that she would have been canceled in the heartbeat.
*  She was the original Gigi Hadid.
*  How about that as a reference?
*  Is that my cool and young now?
*  I missed it.
*  I've heard that name before, but I know is her dad got sued because he built a house that's too big.
*  With no permits.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, I know.
*  Nope.
*  Absolutely no permits.
*  It's way too big and the neighbors are worried it's going to fall on them.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Looks like a UFO.
*  It's still there.
*  Oh, yeah, of course.
*  They haven't even figured out what to do with it yet.
*  No, no.
*  I think there's lawsuits.
*  Look at Bo.
*  Back in the day.
*  How about the one on the left?
*  Go to that one.
*  Can't nips.
*  Ka-pow Google.
*  Ka-pow.
*  I'm going back.
*  I'm going to go back and do a deeper dive on this.
*  She was hot as fuck.
*  Perfect bone structure, right?
*  Yeah, she was amazing.
*  The thing about Farley was he and Spade used to fight over me like I was the girl.
*  Probably because, let's face it, I kind of look like a girl in certain lighting.
*  They'd be like, I heard you were in the jacuzzi of the Robb last night.
*  Yeah?
*  Well, you didn't call me.
*  They would fight.
*  It was very funny and sweet.
*  One night I took the gang out to Barbarian Steakhouse in Toronto.
*  Great steak.
*  I don't know if they're still there.
*  Chris ordered two bone-in, two bone-in steak, porterhouse steaks.
*  Ate both of them.
*  But on top of each bite, he put a cube of butter.
*  When I looked at him like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  He was like, it needs a hat.
*  If you want to put a hat on your steak.
*  Some people just genuinely don't give a fuck.
*  No fucks given.
*  Obviously.
*  He's a wild man.
*  I met him once on the set of News Radio.
*  He's partying with Andy Dick.
*  He showed up gray like wet cardboard.
*  He looked gray.
*  And I'm like, hey man.
*  He's like, hey.
*  It was just, he was gone.
*  It was sad.
*  It was weird.
*  He had gray skin.
*  I remember thinking, Jesus Christ, Chris Farley has gray skin.
*  What's going on?
*  He was sweaty and just all fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  He had major, major demons.
*  And a lot of us really worked out.
*  But some people can't make that leap, man.
*  The thing about him though is, fucking I always wonder about guys like that, that are so powerful.
*  Like, isn't it the demons that made him so good?
*  He was so good.
*  So good.
*  He would go ape shit.
*  I mean, he had the fucking horsepower he had.
*  It was so stunning.
*  When you have these scenes where he would just go fucking crazy.
*  It was so fun.
*  I would wonder, like, what is that same thing?
*  What makes him?
*  I mean, because it was so real.
*  Is that what made him just go crazy with Coke and go crazy with everything else?
*  I mean, I think, I think like normal people, like I don't see a lot of normal people drawn.
*  Why would any normal person want to be in entertainment?
*  Right.
*  Why would they?
*  So I think just by default, damaged people or people with more articulately, people with a hole to fill
*  are drawn to entertainment to fill the hole.
*  And some of the people have other damage too, rage, anger, whatever it is.
*  But without a question, the more normal someone is, I know, like, unfortunately, the less entertaining.
*  Do you ever find that though?
*  Like you're out at dinner or whatever and they're like, I'm this thing.
*  And they're like really, really nice and really, really decent.
*  And I go, I wish you were crazy and damaged like me because then you'd be really.
*  Then we'd have a fun conversation.
*  Well, that's absolutely the case with comedians.
*  Like my favorite people are all completely fucked up.
*  Have you ever met, can you think of a normal, decent, well-rounded, unfucked up person who's hilarious?
*  No, I'll tell you real quick.
*  Right?
*  No, no, humor is a big part of humor is saying things that are radically inappropriate.
*  Right.
*  But may be accurate.
*  Do you think, do you think that our culture, where everybody is so sensitive today is,
*  it's got to be hard to be, I think it's harder to be funny.
*  You like, you can make blazing sound.
*  There's so many movies you couldn't make now.
*  Right.
*  Or jokes you couldn't tell.
*  Or I mean, most of Monty Python's movies.
*  I mean, so many, we were watching some old Eddie Murphy movies and just,
*  just movies from the 2000s you can't, you couldn't make today.
*  Eddie Murphy was, it is still, I mean, what a stud.
*  Oh my God, he's amazing.
*  Fucking we're talking about Norbit.
*  I'm like, Norbit is a massively underrated movie.
*  That is a hilarious movie.
*  And if I looked on Rotten Tomatoes, I think it got like fucking 13% or something like that.
*  I'm like, I don't get it.
*  How did you miss this?
*  I was crying laughing, like, like wheezing at certain scenes.
*  He is such a-
*  Nutty Professor, Nutty Professor, Nutty, Nutty Professor 2 is fucking terrible.
*  And also the Clumps?
*  The Clumps, that's two.
*  That's the second one.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Nutty Professor is insane.
*  Nutty Professor is insane.
*  Nutty Professor 2 is terrible.
*  All those, he plays all those characters.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's amazing.
*  It's just the script doesn't work in Nutty Professor 2.
*  And then they got rid of Jada Pickett Smith and replaced her with someone else too.
*  It's like, what happened?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a big part of the first movie.
*  He's so good.
*  The Nutty Professor 1 is excellent, but he's just boring.
*  Have you revisited the standup specials of Eddie's in the leather suits?
*  I mean, I've seen them all multiple times.
*  I haven't revisited them in the last few years.
*  They're worth having a look again.
*  He's one of the greatest of all time.
*  It's crazy that he hasn't done standup in 30 years.
*  As long as you've not been drinking, he hasn't been doing standup.
*  Jesus.
*  Maybe there's two of you.
*  Well, they were related.
*  I used to run with Eddie back in the day a little bit.
*  It was pretty fun.
*  He's amazing.
*  I mean, it's really every comic that I know wants him to do standup again.
*  Every comic.
*  Like there was a thing, we talked about it on the podcast before,
*  but there was a thing that he did where he was accepting some award and he was on stage
*  and he did this piece about Bill Cosby because him and Bill Cosby always had feuds.
*  It was on one of his older specials.
*  I think it was on Raw where him and Richard Pryor had a conversation
*  because Bill Cosby called him and chastised him about delirious, about using bad words.
*  And so he did this whole thing where Bill Cosby called him and told him,
*  and then he called Richard Pryor.
*  Richard Pryor was like, do the people laugh?
*  Do you get paid?
*  We'll tell Bill to have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.
*  Yes.
*  Have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.
*  So he had no choice.
*  For him, that was painful because every comic was a Bill Cosby fan.
*  Sure.
*  They found out what the fuck he was really all about.
*  So for him to get a phone call from Bill Cosby instead of saying,
*  you're amazing.
*  I fucking love what you're doing.
*  I'm in your corner.
*  Congratulations.
*  Instead he gets, you should stop saying bad words.
*  So anyway, years later, he hasn't done standup in forever.
*  Accepts this award and talks about what, because they took back Bill Cosby's
*  honorary doctorate and all these different, they took awards away from him.
*  And he does this whole routine about Bill getting his awards taken away.
*  And it's fucking brilliant.
*  And he hasn't done standup in 30 years.
*  And you look at him and you're like, Jesus Christ, if that guy did standup right now,
*  he'd have the biggest Netflix special on earth.
*  And it would probably be an hour of fucking gold, just straight gold.
*  He just doesn't, I mean.
*  He's talking about doing it.
*  He's talked about doing it.
*  I bet pre-COVID, he was talking about doing it.
*  I mean, obviously COVID fucked it up for everything.
*  It's really hard to do a show now.
*  And I don't know where it's going to go.
*  I hope he does it though.
*  But he's a special talent, a very unique talent.
*  Yeah.
*  And a wonderful enigma.
*  He's so nice.
*  He's one of those people that people have all of these,
*  people project things on Eddie.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  What he's like, what he is, what he isn't.
*  Because he's just one of those guys and he's kind of an enigma.
*  He's kind of unknowable, but he's such a good dude.
*  Well, he's so talented.
*  I mean, we all grew up with him.
*  48 hours.
*  And dude, 48 hours is the shit.
*  The shit.
*  Him and Nick Nolte?
*  Nick Nolte is so...
*  So...
*  I mean, that movie, I mean, that's the ultimate...
*  Amazing.
*  I mean, look...
*  Buddy Cop movie.
*  There's the Danny Glover one with Mel, but to me, it's all about 48 hours.
*  I wonder if you can make a Buddy Cop movie anymore, now that everybody hates cops.
*  There they are.
*  Look at them.
*  Could you make a Buddy Cop movie today?
*  They don't want you to.
*  They wouldn't want you to.
*  They don't want you to for sure.
*  Like, cop movies.
*  That was, that's one of the biggest genre.
*  Right?
*  There's a screening of Kindergarten Cop that was supposed to be in Portland or somewhere
*  this weekend that was cancelled because people said that it was showing cops in a good light
*  or something like that.
*  I hope they get robbed.
*  I hope everybody says they get robbed.
*  Can you imagine?
*  You gotta watch...
*  You ever see Nolte and...
*  I don't really hope they get robbed, by the way.
*  These are just jokes.
*  You ever seen Nolte and Q and A?
*  The movie Q and A?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Sydney Lamont movie.
*  Now that I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  Where he plays a racist cop?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, he's amazing, man.
*  You know, there's a fucking movie that's not that good.
*  It's called Warrior.
*  It's like this martial arts movie that was a few years ago.
*  And Nick Nolte plays this guy who is a trainer of one of the fighters.
*  And he's the father of one of the fighters as well.
*  And he's just alcoholic and he's all fucked up.
*  And he has this scene where he breaks down and he's crying and weeping.
*  And you just go, God damn.
*  If you forget, this is it right here.
*  He's so good.
*  He's so good.
*  That outfit, that's the outfit he wears to go to the market in Malibu.
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  I ran into him at Frye.
*  Look at him right there.
*  I mean, this scene.
*  That's also how he orders at McDonald's.
*  Screaming red faced.
*  I ran into him at Frye's Electronics.
*  He's, oh, hey, Joe.
*  He was buying some motherboard or some shit.
*  He's a kid.
*  He's just amazing.
*  Yeah, he's amazing.
*  So here's, I gotta tell you how much I'm loving your podcast.
*  I love it.
*  It's great.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm a big fan.
*  And one of the things I love about, because I'm doing my own now and I'm learning from the best
*  and the best would be you, is it's just literally anything and everything that makes you,
*  like you're curious about.
*  And I love that.
*  So I know it because I've been paying attention.
*  I know you're curious about space.
*  Let's talk for a minute because this week, Elon Musk.
*  Yeah.
*  He did the big thing that was fun to watch.
*  But isn't it funny how excited we all are that we just replicated something we did 50 years ago?
*  Well, even better though.
*  They replicated something in a much more improved way where it can actually come back
*  and land and it's reusable.
*  That's the difference.
*  Don't you think though, we have to have, there has to be a secret space program.
*  There has to be.
*  Do you think so?
*  Well, here, okay, let's just go through the logic.
*  This is what happens when at night time when I have a cigar.
*  You sure you don't do drugs?
*  I know.
*  Do you want a cigar?
*  Do you smoke cigars?
*  I do smoke cigars.
*  You want one?
*  I was going to bring one and I forgot, but hell yeah.
*  Beautiful.
*  At least we can get some kind of drugs.
*  I know.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's fucking go.
*  By the way, I enjoy watching people take drugs.
*  I do.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah, because I have a very expensive wine cellar.
*  I don't drink.
*  You don't drink at all.
*  You just have the wine for other folks?
*  For guests.
*  Wow.
*  Could you have like a glass of wine or are you just a deep end kind of guy?
*  Every single person I know who either you have the ism of alcoholism or you don't.
*  And if you have come to terms with the fact that you have it, the day where you go, you know what?
*  I'm going to live in Europe for a while and gosh, I mean a glass of red wine at my birthday is not
*  going to kill me.
*  I'm not going to do heroin anymore.
*  That's what brought me to my knees.
*  But a glass of red wine.
*  Literally, you can put a fucking stopwatch on it and it might not be in a week and it
*  might not be in a month and it might not even be in a year.
*  But I assure you, you'll read about them in the paper like biting a cop in their stomach
*  and jumping off of a roof or 100%.
*  I've been in this game 30 years.
*  I've never seen it go any way other than that.
*  Never.
*  I like to believe there's someone out there that can do it.
*  Just like I like to believe some people can walk tightrope between two buildings.
*  Yeah, nor people who aren't alcoholics.
*  They can do it.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  What do we got here, bro?
*  This is good.
*  Okay, why can't I open this?
*  There we go.
*  Got it.
*  Hell, I would have brought my own.
*  Well, I just have this box here from my friend Mike Binder.
*  Oh, you know Mike?
*  Yep.
*  He's doing this comedy store documentary and he bought me a box of cigars.
*  What company is this?
*  Do you know this company?
*  They're great.
*  There's nothing better than a cigar when you're fasting.
*  Cause you're good and fucked up.
*  Are you fasting right now?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you do, the intermittent?
*  I do intermittent and then I do every other day at 24 hour.
*  Really?
*  Which I got from Kimmel.
*  Remember that moment where all of a sudden Kimmel didn't look like Kimmel anymore?
*  Lost like 80 pounds.
*  Yeah, and I was like, and I did, and like, you know, in the commercial breaks,
*  the band's playing and people were screaming, hey, why do you look so good?
*  And he's like, I don't eat every other day.
*  I was like, that's gotta be bought.
*  The board went right back and I never got to like finish the conversation with him,
*  but I've since learned about it and I did, I've done it and it's been great.
*  What's the benefits?
*  Honestly, I think at the end of the day, the benefit is just, it's just an easy way to keep
*  the calories down, but I find I'm more focused and actually have more energy.
*  That's crazy.
*  If you think about taking a whole day off of eating.
*  But here's the thing is it's, it sounds worse than it is because you eat dinner.
*  So the day goes from dinner to dinner.
*  Right.
*  So there's not an active day that I'm not eating.
*  Oh, okay.
*  It's still 24 hours.
*  Yeah, it's a meal.
*  That's what Jack Dorsey does.
*  Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, he eats one meal a day and he said he realizes that a lot of
*  that lighter sucks, unfortunately.
*  Do we have another lighter?
*  No, I'm good, right?
*  No, I'm good.
*  We're good to go.
*  This is good.
*  I like this.
*  They're good, right?
*  Yeah, really good.
*  Yeah.
*  I do intermittent.
*  I do either 14 or 16 hours.
*  And then you're like, you know, low carb, low sugar.
*  Mostly meat.
*  Mostly what I eat is meat.
*  Like almost entirely meat.
*  What are veggies?
*  I eat some fruit.
*  Veggies?
*  This whole month, I'm not eating.
*  I'm barely eating any vegetables.
*  What?
*  This is animal based August.
*  Animal based August?
*  Yeah, you know, plant based.
*  I'm plant based.
*  Well, there's animal based August.
*  Mostly what I'm eating is meat.
*  Well, there's animal based August.
*  Did the vegan army come for you?
*  Oh, they've come.
*  They've come for me.
*  I give them hugs.
*  Look, those animals are going to die.
*  I'll send them videos of wolves eating elk alive.
*  If you want to see that, it's better if I kill them.
*  Trust me.
*  And then you don't live forever.
*  And do you fish at all?
*  Yeah, I love fishing.
*  Yeah, my son Matthew Lowe is a world class fisherman.
*  And do you fly fishing?
*  No, it's all deep sea.
*  It's all deep sea stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  We have a boat and we go out and it's like the sashimi fish tacos.
*  He has a commercial fisherman's license.
*  Really?
*  He's got a law degree and a commercial fisherman's license.
*  That's fucking balanced.
*  It's a well rounded young man.
*  You did a good job.
*  Congratulations.
*  Yeah, it's good shit.
*  And then my other son is a writer on 9-1-1 Lone Star.
*  No kidding.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I know.
*  Dude, you pulled it off.
*  I did.
*  You've got kids.
*  Being a dad is a full time job, but I love it.
*  I'm one of those people that for whatever reason,
*  I knew it was what I was born to do immediately.
*  And I devoted every fucking minute to it and loved it.
*  And it paid off.
*  And my boys are great.
*  Cheryl's a great wife and great partner for me.
*  But I love seeing that kind of time investment pay off.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's beautiful because then they become these sustainable,
*  fascinating human beings.
*  How old are your kids?
*  I have a 23-year-old.
*  I have a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old.
*  That's kind of good.
*  You love going through this because mine are 24 and 26.
*  So the notion of going back and having another crack at it
*  kind of sounds kind of cool.
*  It is kind of cool.
*  What's weird about babies and just humans,
*  they're so different right out of the box.
*  Like there's so much study on what makes a personality,
*  what makes a human being, whether it's nature or nurture.
*  And people who are parents can tell you
*  there's certain aspects of a kid's personality
*  that they're just born with.
*  You see them with it as a baby, like right out of the box.
*  One year in, they're different.
*  Two years, they're so different.
*  Sometimes my daughters will say something to me.
*  And I just get so stunned just talking to them.
*  I remember when you were this tiny little thing.
*  And now you and I are sitting here
*  and we're having a conversation about space
*  or about mortality or about what I think God is
*  or about why do people act mean?
*  I was having this conversation with my daughter,
*  with my 12-year-old about mean people.
*  And I'm like, believe me, it seems like they're just mean,
*  but they're only mean because they're hurting.
*  That's why people are mean.
*  They feel terrible, so they want you to feel terrible.
*  And we were just having this weird conversation
*  about emotions and about where it comes from
*  and how some people, their family's broken up
*  and because of that, they wish that things were normal
*  so they make up lies or when other people are doing well,
*  they get angry at other people.
*  And we were just talking through this.
*  And in the middle of it, I'm talking to her
*  and I'm thinking, I remember when you were so small.
*  I know.
*  You were this tiny little thing.
*  And now here you are, this 12-year-old who's like,
*  we're having this intense conversation about emotions
*  and the development of human beings
*  and how to be more compassionate
*  and how there's this instinct to go, fuck her.
*  And I'm like, I know you have that feeling,
*  but you got to fight that feeling.
*  Like, nobody has that feeling more than me,
*  that fuck you feeling.
*  I got a lot of that.
*  But you got to keep it locked up.
*  It's not good for you.
*  It doesn't do you any good either.
*  When you're like, fuck you,
*  you're really saying, fuck yourself.
*  Not helping you.
*  Because you're developing anger
*  instead of developing forgiveness.
*  Like you develop this anger towards a person
*  where it's better, it's hard, but it's better
*  to try to understand why they're that way
*  and why they're lashing out at you.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you do that, what I was explaining to her
*  is like, it'll be ineffective.
*  Like their mean stuff to you will be ineffective.
*  It doesn't work anymore because you know who you are.
*  So if you know who you are,
*  it'll bother you that they're trying to do it.
*  But you won't change your feelings about yourself.
*  If you don't have a good sense of personal sovereignty,
*  someone can change your feelings about yourself.
*  I remember when I was young, someone could insult me
*  and I would think that they were right.
*  I'd be like, oh God, I am a loser.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, fuck, I'm a loser.
*  Shit.
*  And I'd go home and I'd feel terrible
*  and I'd feel like a loser.
*  But if someone does it to you when you have sovereignty,
*  you're like, oh, that feels gross
*  that this person is trying to make me feel bad.
*  But it doesn't change who I am.
*  I know who I am.
*  You gain an understanding through struggle.
*  And we were having this conversation.
*  I remember thinking, God, it's so weird
*  that people just sort of pop out of vaginas.
*  You know, you have sex, person gets developed,
*  they pop out of a giant.
*  Next thing you know, they're 12
*  and they're sitting across the dinner table.
*  Just you and her just chit chatting.
*  It's God.
*  So it's amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's true.
*  I always tell my kids that great phrase about bitterness
*  and anger and bitterness is it's like drinking poison
*  and expecting the other person to drop dead.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  I love that statement.
*  It's a great one, isn't it?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And worldview, right?
*  Optimism, positivity, rejection of victimhood,
*  all that stuff is so important, I think, in development.
*  They're tools, too.
*  They're tools for success because there's so many people
*  that contain, they hold on to that stuff.
*  What's that other expression?
*  That anger is a poison that kills the vessel that holds it.
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  Yeah, but they do.
*  But you can use them as tools to understand people.
*  You know, like that feeling that you get, it's a tool
*  and the understanding of how to manage that is a tool.
*  You can use it and you could understand people better
*  and then you'll recognize it in yourself better
*  and it'll prevent you from making some catastrophic mistakes.
*  You know, one of the things about angry, bitter, spiteful people
*  is like they rarely get anything done.
*  They really accomplish anything good.
*  They really, they always have this bitter, horrible feeling
*  that they're carrying around with them.
*  It's just...
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm a big believer in therapy
*  and personal digging and growth and stuff like that.
*  I mean, it's part and parcel with my recovery.
*  Recovery is not for everybody nor should it be,
*  but I think therapy could and should be.
*  I think it should be like going and get your oil checked.
*  Do you do like AA meetings and the whole deal?
*  I, you know, it's an anonymous program, Joe.
*  Oh, you can't even say it?
*  The AA Gestapo will come and get me.
*  Will they really?
*  If you say you go to AA?
*  Here's why.
*  It's in what they call the traditions, right?
*  They literally like, it's like the constitution of AA.
*  It's in the constitution because the theory is
*  if I were to say AA works, I go to AA
*  and then God forbid I slip,
*  then the person who might have been on the fence
*  about going to AA will go, why?
*  No, that's bullshit.
*  That guy was in AA and he slipped.
*  That's the theory about it.
*  That's a weird theory because exercise works, right?
*  You get in shape and then you can just decide to eat Twinkies
*  and you get out of shape,
*  but it doesn't mean that exercise doesn't work.
*  Listen, I, there are people that, you know,
*  true traditionalists don't even like people talking
*  with the amount that I talk about recovery publicly
*  for that reason, but my thing is in this world,
*  addiction is such a fucking killer
*  and there are so many families suffering from it
*  that and every teenager is going to have to figure out
*  their relationship with drugs and alcohol.
*  There isn't one who isn't going to have to
*  and a lot of people are going to fuck that up and some aren't,
*  but the more that conversation is out there
*  and that people can talk about it openly is better.
*  So I kind of am more public about it just because
*  it's, you know, changed my life, saved my life.
*  I don't have alcoholism in my family nor personally,
*  but I admire people who talk about recovery.
*  I think it's important because I think,
*  especially someone like you,
*  because you're a very famous public figure
*  and when you talk about addiction and your own struggles,
*  people say, well, fucking Rob Lowe has a problem with booze.
*  Like, okay, it's, this is like a thing.
*  Right.
*  It's part of being a person.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I think, I think it's very valuable.
*  I think you talking about it is very valuable
*  and I think it's honorable.
*  Well, thanks.
*  I mean, and I, I get a lot of,
*  I get a lot out of it because inevitably, you know,
*  I meet people who are earlier on their journey
*  and it reminds me of how bad it can be
*  if you don't keep an eye on it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, because I'm just one of those people.
*  It's like, you know, if it says take two aspirin,
*  then I immediately think, well, then five has got to be fucking great.
*  Then you should, I mean, that's, that is the way my brain works.
*  Do you think that that's from becoming famous
*  when you're very young?
*  Like, what is the earliest big thing that you did?
*  What's the earliest big project that you did?
*  I mean, it was probably that, that Karen Carpenter
*  look-alike look thing I had going on.
*  But like a big, that was sort of, but I mean, you said that was not-
*  Oh, the big knockout.
*  That put me on the teen magazines though.
*  And that, that's, that, that I went from like
*  a theater geek who couldn't be like,
*  none of the cool girls gave a shit about.
*  Cause I was like, yeah, cause I was a theater geek.
*  And it's a good looking fellow.
*  I was pretty, I didn't look like the fucking football playing.
*  They all wanted the football players and the beach volleyball players.
*  And in, in that culture, like youth entertainment wasn't a thing.
*  There was no MTV.
*  There was no us magazine.
*  There was no Nickelodeon.
*  There's none of it.
*  So like, it was kind of this like thing that-
*  It starts to watch in 87.
*  Look at you.
*  87 is late though.
*  I mean, you can, you can re-enroll that thing back to 79 and get some good shit.
*  Duran Duran.
*  Look at Michael J. Fox.
*  Look at him.
*  The monkeys were still around.
*  What?
*  Duran Duran.
*  You know, it's funny how in Europe, like things that are almost like campy here are still cool.
*  Like Mirko Krokop is one of the baddest motherfuckers of all time.
*  His kickboxer used to come out to Duran Duran.
*  That was his walkout song.
*  Come out to Wild Boys.
*  I mean, he's a fucking straight up killer.
*  He's a terrifying human being.
*  And he would come out to Duran Duran.
*  That's unbelievable.
*  That's awesome.
*  I loved it.
*  I was like, that is the scariest human being on earth.
*  That's a fucking Duran Duran fan.
*  Who's the guy that-
*  This is going to be like, who's the baseball player?
*  And you're like Babe Ruth.
*  Yeah, that's him.
*  But who's the fucking gnarly motherfucker from Hawaii?
*  BJ Penn.
*  Oh yeah, BJ.
*  So BJ, when I met BJ, and I don't know anything really much about the sport, he was like,
*  you know that before every match I watch Youngblood.
*  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
*  What?
*  Are you kidding me?
*  BJ's crazy.
*  He's crazy.
*  He's so crazy.
*  So fucking nuts.
*  That's funny.
*  So you don't think they're connected to becoming very famous at an early age?
*  Sort of exacerbates?
*  Because I would imagine-
*  It blows it up, but you got to have it in you.
*  Okay.
*  You have to have it in you anyway.
*  Is it a family thing?
*  Is it genetic?
*  It's partially genetics.
*  It's in the family for sure.
*  100%.
*  It's in my family, both sides of the family.
*  But some people don't have it.
*  Some people do.
*  And what exacerbates it is the access, all the stuff that you'd think.
*  It's like fame and money and all that is jet fuel for addiction.
*  And then on the other side of it is there's always in the back of your mind
*  that if it works out, if I get this movie or I get this part or whatever,
*  then I'll feel better about myself.
*  And then you get it and you don't.
*  And then you're really fucked.
*  So that's why when people go, he had it all.
*  I don't understand.
*  I go, I understand.
*  I understand perfectly.
*  His dreams came true and they didn't fucking change who he was.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you ever have imposter syndrome?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Right.
*  I have a lot of syndromes, but I'm not sure I've had that one.
*  You think he didn't have it because you were famous early on?
*  Maybe.
*  It was like a normal thing to be honest.
*  Because I also had a vision when I was a kid that I was going to do what I was going to do.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, I knew it.
*  How old?
*  I knew it as sure as I'm sitting here smoking a cigar with you.
*  I knew it.
*  I knew I was going to be an actor.
*  I knew it was going to be successful and I knew it was going to happen.
*  And here's the thing.
*  I was too young and too stupid to know otherwise.
*  And no one told me different.
*  I'm so grateful that I didn't have someone telling me that 99% of the people in the screen actors guild.
*  These are people who are acting, who've made it.
*  They're in Hollywood and they're acting.
*  99% of them can't support themselves as an actor.
*  Really?
*  That's a true statistic.
*  That's a crazy number.
*  Now if somebody had told me that, it might have fucked me up and maybe my vision would have weakened.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's interesting, right?
*  Like if someone gives you, like someone made it, you made it, people are, obviously there's movies.
*  People are making it.
*  Like I say to my kids, listen, I don't know what the odds are, but somebody's got to do it.
*  Why not you?
*  Yes, that's a good way to look at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's that was the thing.
*  So I had that, which is both a curse and a blessing because I knew I didn't have to go through the thing that so many people do where they don't really know where they fit in the world and don't know what their gift is.
*  I don't know what they want to do with their lives.
*  So you never wavered.
*  You had this idea.
*  How old were you when you figured it out?
*  Eight.
*  Jesus.
*  I saw a local theater production in Dayton, Ohio of Oliver, of all things.
*  My parents must have known one of the actors and there were kids in it.
*  And it was literally like out of a movie, like, oh, like the light hit me and the skies parted.
*  And I went, I want to do that.
*  And there was a sign up sheet for summer kid acting camp or whatever.
*  And I go, I want to do that.
*  My parents like, yeah, sure.
*  And I'm sure they thought it was like just camp or little league or any other thing that a kid will.
*  But I knew it was the beginning of a step of what I wanted to do.
*  I was deadly serious about it.
*  Wow.
*  That's incredible.
*  That's very fortunate because then you just have to work towards your path.
*  Like so many people are like 30 and they don't know what they want to do with their life.
*  They're doing something they don't enjoy and they're like, I want to find something that I enjoy.
*  And they don't know what that is.
*  That's a tech.
*  Those conversations are terrifying to me.
*  I've had conversations with people like I just got to find what my thing is.
*  I'm like, fuck man.
*  It's hard.
*  And that's my biggest fear for my sons is as a parent, the goals and issues change with age
*  and where they are now, it's all about jobs.
*  And we've had those, my favorite is, so my youngest son, John Owen,
*  was the youngest intern at the Eli Broad stem cell laboratory in the University of San Francisco
*  during his summers in high school.
*  And in fact, was next to one of the scientists that won the Nobel Prize that year.
*  So he gets into Stanford, goes to Stanford, graduates with straight A's.
*  And I'm thinking this is, I've done it as a parent.
*  He's done it.
*  And then he comes back and goes, I want to be in show business.
*  And I wanted to kill myself.
*  I was like, it was worse than wanting, it was actually worse than I want to be in show business.
*  It was worse because it was, I want to be an actor and I wanted to publicly disembowel myself.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  You are a successful actor.
*  You love doing it, but yet you didn't want your kid to do it.
*  Isn't it amazing?
*  It's weird.
*  It is really weird.
*  And there's so much to sort of unpack underneath that.
*  Well, I don't think you want your kids to be in pain, right?
*  The uncertainty of it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you, I always used to read about this quote about Henry Fonda,
*  that to the day he died, and he died with the Oscar for fucking Golden Pond next to him,
*  he thought he would never work again.
*  And I was like, that has to be bullshit.
*  Guess what?
*  It's not.
*  It's not.
*  That's fucking heavy.
*  But then the other thing I would get, and this is the other really weird thing,
*  is I'd wake up in the middle of the night and go,
*  oh, my instinct to beat every creative fucking instinct out of my children
*  is now indicted them and sentenced them to a life of a drone in a cubicle.
*  Way worse.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like your instinct to protect them from uncertainty has led them to the certainty of doom.
*  Ugh.
*  And then you realize, you know what, they're going to be who they are,
*  and Johnny is a really talented writer, and he's found his niche,
*  and ironically went right to work, right out of Stanford.
*  So it all kind of works out, you know, it really does.
*  But we do as dads put our own fears and our own shit on our kids.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's no doubt.
*  You know, I mean, if one of my kids told me they wanted to be a comic, I'd be terrified.
*  Right?
*  Plus also it's like, I don't...
*  There's certain parts of comedy that are so painful, like the bombing.
*  Like I don't think I could be there if my kid was bombing.
*  I would feel it as much as them.
*  Do you remember a joke that you told once that bombed?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Really?
*  Oh my god.
*  You remember the joke or a joke.
*  Dude, I've bombed a lot.
*  I just can't believe that.
*  I had George Lopez on my podcast two days ago, and he was talking about bombing,
*  but you're fucking, you're Joe Rogan, he's fucking, you know,
*  George Lopez, what the fuck?
*  How do you guys don't bomb?
*  You have to come up with new material, and if you're going to come up with new material,
*  some of them are going to be duds.
*  That's just how it is.
*  Yeah.
*  And also you have to take chances if you want to expand.
*  Comedy is, there's a bunch of things going on, right?
*  There's you relating to the audience, there's them liking you,
*  there's these concepts you're trying to flesh out,
*  especially in a workout room like the Comedy Store,
*  like you have to take chances.
*  There's no way around it, and sometimes those chances fall flat on their face.
*  The good thing is through those painful failures,
*  those are like the biggest springboards to improvement and growth.
*  Like every time I've ever had a bad set, my next set has been amazing,
*  because you just feel the sting and you prepare better.
*  And also, like, I think my past bombings have prepared me to not bomb again,
*  because of the fact that I know what it feels like to suck.
*  Dude.
*  I always explain it, that it's like, if someone's like, what's bombing like?
*  It's like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother,
*  except there's probably someone out there that likes sucking a thousand dicks in front of their
*  mother.
*  No one likes bombing.
*  You know, there's probably some guy who's just really into humiliation,
*  but I don't think there's no one out there who's into bombing.
*  Oh, man.
*  I just...
*  Well, because it's like...
*  Oh, well, listen, listen.
*  I will bet you that no one has bombed harder than me.
*  That's not possible.
*  I will.
*  You need to come to the Comedy Store and open mic them.
*  Bro.
*  How is it possible?
*  The no one's bombed.
*  By the way, your trustee, Savant, next to us...
*  Young Jamie?
*  Will pull up...
*  Did you just stand up?
*  He can pull up me bombing in front of a billion people.
*  What did you do?
*  The Academy Awards.
*  Oh, you hosted it?
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  So...
*  You talk about bombing.
*  My dick's bigger than your dick about bombing.
*  I'm 24?
*  24 years old.
*  I'm doing my movies.
*  The Academy Awards asked me to do a big opening number for them.
*  I'm like, holy fucking shit.
*  Can we play it?
*  This is a minute?
*  Yeah.
*  Will we get pulled off of YouTube?
*  Yeah.
*  God damn it.
*  So...
*  I'll play it for us.
*  So...
*  Before you play it, before I go, a little context.
*  A little context.
*  So stop.
*  Stop or I'll bomb again.
*  I'll bomb right now.
*  Again.
*  So they say to me, they go,
*  and I'm like, what year is this?
*  High honor.
*  86.
*  High honor.
*  Fucking catacombs.
*  And I should have probably thought it through because the idea didn't sound great to me,
*  but it's the Academy Awards.
*  They know better than I do.
*  It's their show.
*  And the idea is it's going to be an homage to old time Hollywood.
*  And one of the earliest stars in Hollywood was Snow White, the animated figure.
*  So we're going to have a girl obviously playing Snow White,
*  and we're going to do a duet because it's a big opening musical number.
*  The Oscars always used to open with musical numbers before there were monologues.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yes.
*  This ended it.
*  It ended it.
*  So I'm like, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Me and Snow White.
*  Great.
*  Okay.
*  And anyway, Marvin Hamlisch is going to write it.
*  Marvin Hamlisch.
*  I'm like, I know Marvin Hamlisch.
*  He wrote the Sting.
*  Well, Scott Joplin wrote the Sting, but Marvin Hamlisch won the Academy Award for that.
*  He's a double Oscar.
*  He's a genius.
*  And I'm not going to tell Marvin Hamlisch that I think that the lyrics are cheesy.
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  So when they get Ike and Tina Turner's Proud Mary and change the lyrics to,
*  did a lot of work for Walt Disney.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh no.
*  Like I'm saying, it's a bomb.
*  Okay.
*  You and I are going to watch this and we're going to pause for the people at home.
*  If you need to watch this, YouTube, Jamie, what is it?
*  It's on the Hollywood Reporter's website.
*  I don't know why it's there.
*  What is the title of the actual video?
*  Rob Lowe Bombs.
*  Is that a title?
*  Something like that.
*  Disastrous Open.
*  I don't know.
*  Rob Lowe and Snow White's Disastrous Oscar opening February 20th, 2016.
*  That's actually the title for the people.
*  It literally says disastrous.
*  Okay.
*  Folks at home, Google this, watch it, and then we're going to pick this up after Rob and I watch this.
*  Is that Lily Tomlin at the end?
*  No, that's a truncated version.
*  Yeah, they didn't give you much of it.
*  But can I tell you something?
*  We're back.
*  That was the year that Barry Levinson...
*  I could tell just from the first bar.
*  It was not good.
*  It was going to be bad.
*  Yeah, when you were singing.
*  Did you take singing lessons?
*  No.
*  No.
*  I found the whole thing.
*  What's that?
*  You found the whole thing?
*  It's 11 minutes long.
*  No, it's 11 minutes of sheer terror.
*  That's on YouTube if you want to look at it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Until 11 minutes that ruined Hollywood producer Alan Carr's career forever.
*  Hold on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  He's like, wait, just hang on.
*  Hang on, folks.
*  I need to...
*  I get it.
*  I get it.
*  Okay, so I look out in the middle of the audience and I see Barry Levinson.
*  On this Oscars, he's about to win literally 11 Academy Awards.
*  As an actor, there's no one you would want to impress more than Barry Levinson.
*  It's the year of Rain Man.
*  And I look out, Joe, in the middle of this and I see his face.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  And this is what he literally was going...
*  He went like this.
*  What the fuck?
*  You see him actually make those...
*  I see him mouth the words, what the fuck?
*  And so...
*  Talk about bombing.
*  And I'm like, but you know, we have to have our actor's denial.
*  We can't get through a career without a healthy dose of denial.
*  So I'm like, you know what?
*  Fuck Barry Levinson.
*  What does he know anyway?
*  Fuck that guy.
*  And I go backstage and it's in the green room and it's early
*  in the show and there's an older lady in the corner with flaming red hair and I'm kind of
*  looking at her and she sees me and she goes, young man, I didn't know you were such a good singer.
*  Come sit down.
*  It was Lucille Ball.
*  And I went over and we sat down and she held my hand and we watched the Oscars together.
*  And you know what?
*  It made it all almost worthwhile.
*  Almost.
*  Here's why that's not as bad as bombing doing standup.
*  How is that not as bad?
*  It's not as bad because even though a billion people watched it, A, you didn't write it and
*  B, you knew where you were going.
*  You could just sing the stupid song and get it over with.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's bombing.
*  It's bad.
*  But when you're bombing doing standup, you are the writer, you are the creator,
*  you are the performer.
*  You put it together.
*  You edited it.
*  You prepared it.
*  You got it ready.
*  And then you're just up there eating shit.
*  And people are angry at you.
*  They're angry.
*  They're angry because they can talk.
*  They were angry.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  They were angry.
*  Here's the other thing they did.
*  It never occurred to the Academy to maybe that they needed to license the likeness of Snow White.
*  What?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, no.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And you know how Disney is about likenesses.
*  They're so easy going.
*  Yeah, they're so they're so generous.
*  So generous.
*  So that see, I would have thought I would have got I think I would have gotten away
*  with it a little bit in terms of history had there not been massive lawsuits the next day
*  over the likeness thing, which made then people thought about when people went back and went,
*  wait a minute, that fucking sucked way worse than I thought it did.
*  What was the next thing you did after that?
*  I think let's see.
*  Would it have been I feel like it might have been bad influence with Kurt with
*  James Spader and one of my favorite movies.
*  That's a great movie.
*  I love that movie.
*  That's a good way to bounce back.
*  That was a good one.
*  Let's look at the bright side.
*  Yeah.
*  No, listen.
*  And it is a.
*  Did you consider saying no?
*  No.
*  A people pleasing midwesterner at 24.
*  Right.
*  Does not say no to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
*  They don't.
*  And every year, every year I am treated to the honor, the high honor of being on the
*  list of most embarrassing Oscar moments every fucking year.
*  And my thing is this is as I go, hey, wait, guys, you couldn't figure out how to announce
*  the best picture two years ago.
*  And I'm the problem still.
*  Well, it wasn't your fault.
*  I mean, no one would have saved that.
*  No one.
*  No one.
*  Not a fucking human being could have jumped up there and saying that and had it made any
*  sense.
*  Maybe Jim Carrey.
*  Yes, maybe Jim Carrey could have done it.
*  But he would have gone full ace Ventura over the top and people would have been just
*  laughing hysterically at how crazy he is.
*  It's it's one of my great career low light slash highlights.
*  It actually kind of makes me laugh with the onset of perspective in history.
*  That's the beautiful thing about failures.
*  They eventually become funny and they can look back at them.
*  It only took 30 years.
*  It's great.
*  Like there's some movies, man, that are terrible, terrible movies, but they're really funny
*  to revisit, right?
*  Like Showgirls, things along those lines.
*  I'm a big Showgirls fan.
*  Fucking great movie.
*  I think they might have offered me Showgirls.
*  I think they might offer me the Kyle McLaughlin.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
*  You would have had sex with Elizabeth Berkeley in the water.
*  That crazy scene where she's spazzing out while he's having sex with her.
*  Do you remember that?
*  She's spazzing.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's one of the craziest scenes ever.
*  It didn't make any sense.
*  Why is she spazzing?
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  It's like they were on Coke when they were doing the movie, writing the movie, performing
*  the movie and they just their connection with what's realistic or even entertaining
*  or even possible.
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  If you were having sex with a woman and she was flailing around like that and you kept
*  going, you'd be a criminal.
*  She's having a seizure.
*  Yeah, she has epileptic fit.
*  They were in a pool and for whatever reason, she starts flopping.
*  I mean, they're making out, he's got his arm around her and she's throwing her body,
*  slapping it against the water in this insane, I just want to know who was filming that and
*  was like, cut.
*  We got it.
*  We fucking got it.
*  You got that one.
*  We got it.
*  You could hear the fucking jackhammer heart rate of everyone was filming it because they're
*  all coked up.
*  Have you seen that scene?
*  Yeah, I'm trying to find the non porn site.
*  No, we want to post it so we can watch it.
*  But I think that's the only place I can find it.
*  YouTube doesn't have it?
*  Do porn sites have it?
*  Yes, definitely.
*  Why?
*  Is she topless in it?
*  Is that what it is?
*  I think so, probably.
*  Oh.
*  I don't even remember the topless part.
*  She's so ridiculous.
*  There's no nudity in movies anymore, but in the 80s, I had the page 73 rule because that's
*  always the page the nude seeds were on.
*  They were always on page 73.
*  Because that's the middle of the second.
*  Here it is.
*  So they're making out.
*  Yeah, he's pouring.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  Yeah, there's some not on YouTube stuff.
*  Yeah, ex videos.
*  They start fooling around and she gets on top of them.
*  And then once they start doing it, she starts flailing.
*  You see it here.
*  What is she doing?
*  It looks almost normal.
*  This looks almost normal.
*  Almost.
*  She's just crazy.
*  But then she gets really spastic.
*  And she starts throwing herself on the fucking water.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Come on, man.
*  What's happening here?
*  What is that?
*  Is that for real?
*  Yes, it is for real.
*  That was in the movie.
*  And I mean, people have to remember,
*  she's the sweetheart from Saved by the Bell, right?
*  And this was going to be her break from Saved by the Bell.
*  This beautiful girl.
*  And he's the guy from fucking Blue Velvet.
*  I had forgotten.
*  But can you imagine making that movie today?
*  No.
*  Yeah, no, page 73, because it's the middle of act two.
*  And any writer out there knows that the middle of the second act
*  is the Sahara of creativity.
*  That's when you're alone with your thoughts,
*  and you're like, fuck, we've got to get to the ending.
*  Someone's got to get naked.
*  Someone's got to get naked.
*  And usually it would have been me.
*  How many times did you show your butt in a movie?
*  Too many.
*  How many, if you get a guess?
*  It was the 80s.
*  It's what we did.
*  It's what we did.
*  It was my job.
*  This was 90s.
*  That movie was like-
*  It was right at the end, yeah.
*  I was in Hollywood.
*  I was living here.
*  So I moved here in 94.
*  So that had to be like 95, right?
*  97.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  This was also the era where Coke was openly sold on sets.
*  Really?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Sure.
*  Wow.
*  It was either the camera department or the prop department.
*  It makes more sense to be the prop department,
*  and their job is to go get shit for you, right?
*  Yeah.
*  When we did Outsiders, we were kids.
*  Cruz and me and Matt Dillon and everybody, we were young.
*  I was 17.
*  17 turning 18, and C. Thomas Howell, who played Pony Boy,
*  the lead in the movie, was 15.
*  And when we would finish shooting,
*  we'd get in the vans to get driven back to the hotel,
*  and there would be as much beer as you wanted.
*  He's 15.
*  As much beer as you wanted.
*  And that was a studio movie.
*  Look at you guys.
*  Wait, wait.
*  Can you pull that photo up to see our feet?
*  Is that possible?
*  Because that feet...
*  There it is.
*  It's down there.
*  Okay, look at Swayze.
*  He's standing on bricks.
*  Whose feet?
*  He wanted to be taller.
*  Isn't that great?
*  Swayze's standing on bricks in the back of that.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Isn't that great?
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's my favorite thing.
*  Speaking of Swayze, Roadhouse,
*  that's another horrible movie that's amazing.
*  But people, yeah, people love that movie.
*  It's great.
*  It's fucking great.
*  It's great.
*  He's a bouncer.
*  Yeah, he's the baddest bouncer.
*  And that's part of the thing.
*  It's like, I thought you were going to be bigger.
*  Remember that?
*  That's like one of the lines in the movie.
*  Because he's a legendary bouncer that they bring in
*  to fix really bad honky tonks.
*  The bad problems at the door.
*  It's in a pandemic.
*  People trying to get in the VIPs.
*  He grabs someone's neck and pulls their throat out in the movie.
*  I mean, it's so good.
*  Pain don't hurt.
*  That's actual line in the movie.
*  Pain don't hurt.
*  Those 80s lines are so good.
*  So good.
*  That's such a great one because he's so beautiful.
*  Such a beautiful man.
*  Swayze was an Adonis.
*  He was an Adonis.
*  He would.
*  Gorgeous.
*  He tried to get us to put that God forsaken song,
*  She's Like the Wind, in Youngblood.
*  We were like.
*  There it is.
*  He pulls the throat out.
*  He pulls the guy's throat out.
*  And then he hits him with the worst spinning back kick ever in the butt.
*  Watch.
*  He pulls his throat out and look at this.
*  Poyah.
*  Like Poyah.
*  It's so bad.
*  That's such a bad kick.
*  He probably blew his ACL out doing that.
*  It's so stupid.
*  He was the best, man.
*  He might be the most intense guy I ever worked with.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  He'd be up all night writing and doing body weight pushups with his feet up against a wall
*  all night long.
*  And then show up at this set having not slept and wanting you to hear his new demo.
*  He was like a lot.
*  It was great.
*  It was great.
*  But no, I remember she's like the wind.
*  And I was like, I don't know how that fits in.
*  We're making a hockey movie, bro.
*  I don't know how that fits in the hockey movie.
*  Why did he want that in there?
*  And then sure enough, Dirty Dancing comes out.
*  And that movie's in it and goes to number one.
*  Oh, well, yeah.
*  But that movie.
*  That was a good movie.
*  Dirty Dancing?
*  Yeah, that was a great movie.
*  That was a great movie.
*  Ghost is his best movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Ghost is a great movie.
*  That's a great movie.
*  Great movie.
*  Point Break was a great movie.
*  Great movie.
*  He did some great movies.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a...
*  Keanu was in Young Blood, but I thought he was a French-Canadian goalie.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I didn't know he was an actor.
*  I literally thought he was.
*  We hired this amazing French-Canadian goalie.
*  I can't believe how young you guys were.
*  I know.
*  That's so crazy that they were giving you booze.
*  Look at Keanu's face.
*  It's exactly the same as it is now.
*  That's John Wick.
*  Here he is.
*  That's John fucking Wick.
*  Look at him.
*  Shut up, the plastic cell.
*  How great is John Wick?
*  I love those movies.
*  We love those movies, right?
*  Love those movies.
*  Love them.
*  I love those movies.
*  What's all the crazy gun training that people do?
*  Tarrant Tactical.
*  I go there.
*  Dude, it's badass, right?
*  You want to go?
*  I do.
*  I'll bring you.
*  I would love to do that.
*  Okay, let's go.
*  I go there all the time.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I go there once a week.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I'm in.
*  Yeah, it's...
*  It's...
*  Well, it's good to learn how to shoot a gun properly if you're going to own guns,
*  but I mean Tarrant, he's the best.
*  I shoot regularly, but you can't do any of that tactical stuff unless you're on a tactical range.
*  Right.
*  And you really want to do it with someone like Tarrant who can actually show you how to do it
*  really correctly.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm on the range all the time, but I'm never...
*  I love to get the tactical.
*  That's the great thing about...
*  Here's the thing that I learned about guns that was hilarious is that
*  when I was learning how to shoot properly, I was shooting like an actor
*  because you have to supply the kick.
*  Oh, right.
*  Because it's a blank.
*  Right, right.
*  So all my experience with guns is playing guys who have guns.
*  But blanks have a kick to shoot.
*  It's not like a real...
*  So like you want to make it look good in the movies, you want to give it that little thing.
*  So I would get out of the range and I would be doing all my acting.
*  It'd be like getting in a fight and purposely missing you by three inches.
*  I know how to movie fight.
*  Right, right, right.
*  I'd fight you, but I'd miss you on purpose.
*  It's the same with weapons training.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, you'd have to get that out of your system.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He would get that out of you quick.
*  Keanu goes there.
*  He's there all the time.
*  I mean, you'd have to...
*  I would think if you're John Wick, you better stay facile.
*  Yes.
*  Well, that's where he learned.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I see those...
*  They're on YouTube, those famous videos where there's the timer.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'll show you one.
*  And you got to get through all of the...
*  I mean...
*  I don't fucking care about you.
*  Oh, look at him, look at him, look at him, look at him.
*  There it is.
*  Dude, he's such a badass.
*  He's a beast, man.
*  Fucking beast.
*  Look at him.
*  I have an entire section in my phone that just says guns.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh, that shoulder hurts, that shotgun.
*  Ooh.
*  It doesn't.
*  It's not that bad.
*  It's not that bad at all.
*  How about that tactical one they have?
*  Oh, boy.
*  He's shooting dummies from like two inches away.
*  Is that Laura Croft behind him?
*  No, there's a bunch of really hot girls that Taryn has that he teaches.
*  It's really...
*  That's Halle Berry right there.
*  What she got behind her?
*  That's Halle Berry, bro.
*  Jeez.
*  What's that, Jamie?
*  It's a new one?
*  I just clicked on a different video.
*  Yeah, because she's in...
*  I just sent you one.
*  Because she's in John Wick 2...
*  Or 3.
*  She's in 3.
*  And she's in 4 as well.
*  Is 2 the best one?
*  I like 1.
*  1's my favorite.
*  Yeah, because first of all, I love 3, but there's no muscle cars, Chad.
*  Hey, Chad, put the fucking muscle cars back in, bro.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  This is...
*  Doink, doink.
*  It's fun.
*  See?
*  See, he teaches you how to do it.
*  It teaches you correct form and all the...
*  Look at this.
*  Yeah, it's fun.
*  Me and my buddy Tom Segura, we go there all the time.
*  I'm in.
*  It'll be so fun.
*  It's fun to learn.
*  And it's a valuable education.
*  And the fact that he's right here, that he's in California, it's amazing.
*  And you can shoot rifles there.
*  He's got ranges for long range stuff.
*  He's got all kinds of stuff there.
*  All that...
*  Anything active, I'm in.
*  I mean, I'm the guy that always says yes to everything, hence why the Oscars.
*  I'll say it's like...
*  My default answer is yes.
*  But that's also, by the way, why I think that I've managed to navigate
*  so many changing currents in the industry.
*  Because I don't get stuck in one place.
*  When I went on the West Wing, it's hard to think now,
*  but in those days, TV was still considered a lesser medium.
*  Really was.
*  Really?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's right.
*  People would get upset if they had to do TV.
*  I don't do TV.
*  All that stuff.
*  I remember a girl I dated said that to me when I was on a TV show.
*  She's like, I want to do film.
*  I mean, it was a real thing.
*  It was a real perception.
*  And now, obviously, everybody wants to do it.
*  Well, now Netflix is actually better than film,
*  because now you could be on a show like Ozark.
*  That show's great.
*  Fuck!
*  But it's like a film every week, and it concurrently keeps going.
*  Jason's a stud, man.
*  He's so good.
*  He's such a stud.
*  He's so good as an actor, but he's so good as a writer and a director.
*  That show is so goddamn good.
*  I knew him when he was on Little House on the Prairie.
*  Oh, Jesus, I forgot about that.
*  Oh my God, he was on that.
*  He was on Little House on the Prairie.
*  He's so good.
*  Which just goes to show you, you never know.
*  No, you never know.
*  You don't know.
*  No, you never do.
*  Well, humans are versatile, right?
*  Just because someone does one...
*  There's so many people that you think, like, oh, that guy's of this,
*  and then he winds up being this amazing musician.
*  You're like, how?
*  What?
*  Humans are versatile.
*  You know?
*  It takes people sometimes to...
*  Even within their lane, it takes them sometimes a while to find what they're really, really
*  special at.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  He's really, really special at that.
*  For me, as I've tried to do it, look at him.
*  Look at how cute he is.
*  That's him?
*  Look at that little button.
*  Look at him.
*  Could he be any cuter?
*  Couldn't.
*  Still got the same hair.
*  Basically does.
*  Man, you're talking about a guy who's been around a long fucking time.
*  Yeah, he knows what's what.
*  God damn, Jesus.
*  He knows the lay of the land.
*  He wore a fucking Michael Landon.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah.
*  Was Michael Landon Aquaman?
*  Patrick Duffy.
*  Patrick Duffy was Aquaman.
*  Man from Atlantis.
*  Man from Atlantis, that's right.
*  I saw...
*  The first thing, dude, the first time I ever saw something being filmed in California,
*  I had just come out from Ohio.
*  It was 1976.
*  And traffic was all blocked off at the Malibu Pier.
*  And I got out of my...
*  And I saw the lights.
*  It was in the daytime...
*  It was so long ago, they still had lights for daytime shooting.
*  And they were about to do a stunt where Patrick Duffy is the man from Atlantis.
*  He was going to jump off the Malibu Pier.
*  And I was so fucking excited.
*  I used to try to swim like him.
*  Because remember the man from Atlantis?
*  He would swim like a porpoise.
*  He'd swim like a porpoise.
*  And my favorite thing was what made him from Atlantis was this part of his body had a web.
*  Yes.
*  That's it.
*  This is it.
*  Right here.
*  That was all I had.
*  And couldn't he breathe underwater?
*  He could breathe underwater, but this made...
*  That was all they could afford with the special effects.
*  He said a webbing between his thumb and forefinger.
*  I'm so into Atlantis.
*  I'm not a big Atlantis guy anyway.
*  Are you really?
*  Oh yeah, fuck, I love it.
*  I'm trying to figure out where it was.
*  What do you think?
*  They think they found it.
*  They think they found something that represents exactly what the depictions of Atlantis were.
*  These concentric rings.
*  They think that there's some place...
*  Oh God, I want to say off Spain, off the coast of Spain.
*  But isn't our guy Graham saying that basically Atlantis was the pre-existing civilization
*  and it was not an island or one place.
*  It was all of it.
*  Yeah, that's what they think.
*  But it's all speculation.
*  But whatever it was, there's so many different versions
*  so many different versions of this spectacular seaport civilization that was destroyed in the flood.
*  The flood of the Bible, Noah's Ark, there's also an ancient story called the Epic of Gilgamesh.
*  Yes, of course.
*  Yeah, and in that story, there's a very similar story about a flood.
*  This is one of the things that Graham Hancock points to,
*  that there's all these civilizations that talk about...
*  That had no interaction with each other in theory and yet they all have the same oral histories.
*  I did a show with my boys called The Low Files and it was basically...
*  It was an excuse for my boys and I to run around in a souped up Raptor around the country
*  and explore urban legends.
*  Oh wow.
*  It was Anthony Bourdain meets Scooby-Doo.
*  It was a fucking dream come true.
*  Well, that sounds awesome.
*  It was a dream come true.
*  What network was this for?
*  A&E.
*  They were great that they let us do it but it couldn't have been a worse fit.
*  When they put us with ancient aliens for one night, we blew the roof off the place.
*  Really?
*  And we got to look for the wood ape, we got to look for Bigfoot, we did poltergeists.
*  The Low Files.
*  See if you can find the opening credits for The Low Files.
*  It's one of my proudest moments.
*  What year is this?
*  Four years ago.
*  Let's see if they have it.
*  Give me some volume on this.
*  I love spooky legends and scary mysteries.
*  Are we going to get in trouble for using blue arts to call it?
*  Wait, Joe didn't see my homage, the very very end, my homage to Hawaii Five-O.
*  It's the very last 30 seconds of the clip.
*  You have to see it because I'm sure you remember this great shot from Jack Lord's credits in
*  the end of Hawaii Five-O.
*  It's right at the end.
*  Get over from here, right here, watch, here it comes.
*  Did you remember that shot from the balcony?
*  I do.
*  I did.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I designed that whole credit sequence.
*  I got the song, I did the whole, it's one of my favorite things I've done.
*  Blue Oyster Cult, Don't Fear the Reaper.
*  That's the best.
*  It's a great fucking song.
*  So what are the subjects?
*  You went for Bigfoot?
*  We did Bigfoot twice.
*  We did Bigfoot up in Northern California in Walnut Creek.
*  The Patterson Givlin film was shot.
*  Turns out the Wood Ape of Arkansas, Oklahoma is the most active place.
*  And that was where we had some really radical experiences.
*  Where I heard stuff.
*  You heard stuff?
*  Oh yeah, I heard lip popping and chest beating.
*  Really?
*  You really think it was real?
*  I heard chest beating.
*  Who made a great fucking Bigfoot movie?
*  Bobcat Goldthwait.
*  He made a great Bigfoot movie.
*  A scary Bigfoot movie.
*  What is it called again?
*  Do you remember him?
*  Willow Creek.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Did you remember, have you ever seen, what is this?
*  He did it like Blair Witch style.
*  I'm writing that down.
*  I love that.
*  It's fucking good, man.
*  We had a great time and we went with all these guys who are real legit people.
*  They're like regular people and they spend their time out in the woods and they know
*  how many are out there.
*  It was crazy.
*  Matthew, my youngest son, through the thermal imaging saw him hiding.
*  But like doing the thing with the high behind the tree.
*  So you really think the Bigfoot's real?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, here's the thing.
*  The slogan for the Lowe files was, it's more fun to believe.
*  It definitely is more fun to believe.
*  And that's really where I come down on it.
*  It's like, I don't have a dog in the fight, but it's way more fucking fun.
*  For sure.
*  Way more fun.
*  I want Bigfoot to be real.
*  I've always wanted to be real.
*  The problem is the people looking at it also want it to be real.
*  They're trying so hard.
*  They see shadows.
*  They think that are Bigfoot.
*  There's some interesting things.
*  There's some interesting things in terms of like dermal ridges they found on footprints.
*  There's a lot of hair samples and shit that come back and they don't know what they got them from.
*  Not really.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I looked into that.
*  I did a show called Joe Rogan Questions Everything for sci-fi.
*  Me and my buddy Duncan went up to the Pacific Northwest.
*  We brought stuff to real biologists and we actually had samples analyzed.
*  They're all bare.
*  When they say that there's some human or primate DNA, it's always contaminated.
*  It's like the chain of custody between the actual piece of hair
*  and getting it to the lab is always contaminated.
*  Right, yeah.
*  There's no one just stops.
*  It's next to their granola bars and their backpacks that are hiking out.
*  If you touch something, you get your sweat on it and it could show up as human DNA or animal DNA
*  mixed with human DNA.
*  The problem is the people that are into it, the real problem is they want to believe so fucking bad
*  that they just have this crazy confirmation bias and they only look at the good things.
*  My favorite episodes of The Low Files are the ones where we didn't find shit.
*  They were my favorite.
*  Just having fun?
*  It's just a dad and two idiot kids having a blast.
*  The thing about Bigfoot that's interesting is Native Americans had more than 100 different names
*  for that animal.
*  They don't have names for other mythical creatures.
*  Then on top of that, there was an actual animal called a gigantopithecus.
*  It was a huge ape-like creature that stood on two legs and walked upright.
*  It was probably some sort of looked like orangutan-like.
*  It probably looked exactly like what we think of as Bigfoot.
*  It was an actual real animal.
*  Have you ever seen the images of that?
*  I have.
*  And it's funny, the deep connection between Native Americans and that legend is really profound.
*  In one of the episodes that we did, we talked with some of the elders and they would say,
*  no, one reached through the window and touched my chest.
*  This guy is not crazy.
*  I'm not talking to a crazy person.
*  Right, but they also have peyote.
*  Native Americans have other shit.
*  That's true.
*  That would let you see Bigfoot.
*  Maybe that's the thing.
*  Like you only see Bigfoot.
*  Bigfoot's real, but he's interdimensional.
*  You only see him when you're on drugs.
*  That could happen.
*  That absolutely could be real.
*  Like if you get on the right psychedelics, you'll meet aliens.
*  It's funny, as a sober guy, there's part of me that wishes...
*  Because I liked mushrooms, but only like once or twice a year because it's so fucking fun.
*  And like you said, you get all that stuff going.
*  Yeah.
*  I did them last week.
*  Part of... Did you laugh a lot?
*  Because all I did was laugh.
*  Post Malone and I did a podcast.
*  We did mushrooms.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, we had a good old time.
*  How long were you tripping?
*  Well, the podcast was four hours long and we were drinking too.
*  So it was like just madness.
*  It was all just like mushrooms.
*  I could feel the mushrooms and I was getting high too.
*  He wasn't smoking pot, but we were drinking Bud Lights and it was a lot of chaos.
*  This is like exactly what my 80s were like.
*  But I think about people go and do ayahuasca and do those... That really appeals to me.
*  That's different in that you could call it a drug, but DMT, which is what ayahuasca brings up,
*  that's what it's the active ingredient.
*  You're still you.
*  You're not drunk.
*  That's what's weird about it.
*  I don't know what it is, but if you wanted to get real woo-woo,
*  you would call it some sort of a chemical gateway into another dimension.
*  Or to another realm that you can't access without it.
*  It doesn't seem like a drug.
*  How is it not any different than I got stoned and I saw crazy shit?
*  Well, first of all, it's endogenous.
*  Your brain actually has this chemical inside of it.
*  It's one of the more interesting things about this drug is that
*  your body knows how to process it so well.
*  If you do coke, I'm sure you're coked up for a long time.
*  Your body's all fucked up for a long time.
*  Dimethyl tryptamine only lasts like 15 minutes.
*  Your body recognizes what it is, so it brings you back to baseline very, very quickly.
*  So if you do this, it's a 15-minute experience?
*  Yeah.
*  The ayahuasca takes longer because ayahuasca is an orally active version of it.
*  What ayahuasca is, is the roots of one plant and the leaves of the other.
*  You have DMT in one plant and then the other plant,
*  you have something called an MAO inhibitor.
*  MAO is monoamine oxidase, and that's produced by your gut to break down
*  dimethyl tryptamine and a bunch of other chemicals.
*  But it breaks down dimethyl tryptamine because dimethyl tryptamine is in a bunch of different
*  plants.
*  You could trip just eating Filaris grass if you didn't have monoamine oxidase in your gut.
*  If you ate the grass, nothing would happen because your body would break it down.
*  But if you had an MAO inhibitor, then you would trip balls.
*  The other thing that people talk about is like,
*  I vomited for five hours.
*  Yeah, that's the problem with ayahuasca.
*  You're going to blow your asshole out.
*  You're going to diarrhea, throw up.
*  It's disgusting stuff.
*  I don't want to do that.
*  It's also because you're getting the plant,
*  you're getting all the stuff that's not the active ingredient from these roots and these leaves too.
*  And then all of a sudden your body's freaking out.
*  Have you ever had any awakening or vision?
*  I've had a lot of visions on dimethyl tryptamine.
*  Yeah.
*  Anything that you could that you once you got,
*  once you were done tripping, that didn't seem like the ramblings of a madman
*  or was just something you were like, oh, wow, I had a revelation.
*  It's hard to say.
*  They all seem impossible to describe to anybody else,
*  other than people that have experienced it.
*  But what it does make you realize is that how the thing that I always felt when I came back is like,
*  how is this possible?
*  That you could go to a place like this,
*  or you could see something that's way more vivid and way more powerful than regular life.
*  Whatever it is, it's not like it's dull and confusing and you feel drugged and you feel less.
*  You feel more.
*  You see more.
*  It's more vibrant.
*  It's more powerful.
*  And whatever is over there seems to know you.
*  It seems to understand.
*  It seems to be you're communicating with something,
*  something that's far more intelligent than you,
*  far more advanced and not hindered by all of the things that were hindered by,
*  like our egos and our nonsense and our insecurities and our civilization and culture.
*  It's like it's some sort of other kind of consciousness.
*  They joke about things.
*  They make fun of you.
*  One time I did it and all these gestures,
*  like this geometric pattern of gestures,
*  like a fractal, infinite gestures were giving me the finger like this.
*  Fuck you!
*  Mocking me.
*  And the message that I got was that I was taking myself too seriously.
*  Maybe even while my intentions going into the trip,
*  I was taking myself too seriously.
*  Wow.
*  And I remember relaxing on, oh, okay.
*  And they're like, that's right.
*  They're nodding their head.
*  Yes.
*  It was a message.
*  Hey, stupid.
*  You take yourself too seriously.
*  Fuck you!
*  Fuck you?
*  I like fuck you!
*  Gestures, like with a hat and everything.
*  So in your life now,
*  let's say you are stressing out about something as very seriously,
*  do the fractal gestures, do you remember them?
*  And go, oh yeah, I had this.
*  Very, very, very.
*  But you know what I mean?
*  You bring something back that you can
*  use in your this dimension, this time.
*  Humility.
*  There's a humility that comes from real psychedelic experiences that
*  just because you know that they are possible,
*  it makes you second guess the significance of regular existence.
*  Because it seems like that might be where you go when you die.
*  Okay.
*  I was waiting for the moment.
*  I don't know if that's what it is.
*  Here's I, because I don't do drugs, but I've been meditating a bunch,
*  and that's one of the things that people have been telling me for years to do.
*  All the people that I admire, meditation is a part of their lives.
*  And every time I do it, I just go to sleep.
*  Or I start thinking about shit that I can't control.
*  But I've recently started doing it.
*  It's really been amazing and I've definitely noticed some changes.
*  And it's also affected the quality of my dreams.
*  Hmm.
*  You're familiar with vivid dreaming.
*  Sure.
*  Right?
*  Lucid?
*  Lucid dreaming, vivid dreaming, yeah.
*  So I've had a number of them.
*  And I had done some meditating on, I don't mean to overstate it,
*  but like what is it all about?
*  Right.
*  Sure, everybody wants to know that.
*  It sounds cliche.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I did that and then I had a lucid dream that night.
*  And the lucid dream, I went to that place.
*  And it looked like Avatar, like the James Cameron, or Fern Gully.
*  It was like, or like Kauai with the waterfalls and the rainbows.
*  And I was flying.
*  But I was me, but I wasn't me.
*  I didn't have a body, but I could think.
*  And it was definitely me.
*  And the surroundings were so, and the feeling was so full of euphoria and love.
*  Like I started weep sobbing of happiness.
*  And then all of a sudden the voice went, oh, but what about my family?
*  I'm here now and they're not here yet.
*  Because it was sort of, the theory was that I had gone to heaven or whatever the fuck it was.
*  And here's the freaky part, is I realized, you know, they're already there.
*  Because time is not linear.
*  So here, my takeaway from this dream, my ramblings of a madman, we're already there.
*  Well, your brain does produce psychedelic chemicals while you're sleeping.
*  That's one of the things about DMT that's so closely related to dreams,
*  is that it's really hard to remember after it's over, but so vivid when it's happening.
*  This I remembered like, and I remember it now, like I witnessed it.
*  And that's what made it different and special.
*  Maybe the improvement in the way your brain was working because of the meditation,
*  that you had gotten yourself into a state where you could access it.
*  But I think-
*  And I physically asked for it before I went to bed.
*  No, I actively-
*  Have you done it again since?
*  I have and I haven't had, I've had smaller fleeting versions of this,
*  but this was like being, starring in a movie.
*  It was like, it was happening.
*  I think James Cameron nailed something in that Avatar film
*  that resonates with people in a very strange way.
*  Not just that it was an awesome movie, and it was a fucking awesome movie,
*  but that he nailed something that made people want to live like that.
*  You know, there was a thing they were talking about after that movie called Avatar Depression,
*  where people were leaving the film and they were depressed
*  that their life was nothing like Avatar, like Pandora, like living like the Navi.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  There was something about what he nailed.
*  He nailed something in that movie, where it's like this spiritual connection.
*  It was very Ayahuasca-like too.
*  There's this connection to Mother Earth and nature and spirits
*  and the connection of all of them.
*  There's something about that film.
*  He hit some nerve with people.
*  I've never heard of another film generating depression that,
*  you know, there's no Star Wars depression.
*  Other than when you see some of the ones that have recently come out.
*  Yeah, that's depressing.
*  That's what happens when the executives get a hold of it.
*  And they go, hey, you got to go to Cuba and grab the people and put them in the boat.
*  That's right.
*  And then they listen.
*  That's right.
*  That's exactly right.
*  That's exactly what happens.
*  But, you know, James Cameron's such a force of nature.
*  You can't really do that to him.
*  He figured something out in those movies.
*  He figured out how to tap into some sort of elemental area of the psyche
*  that people just resonated with people like sort of the same way.
*  I think, you know, people that talk about folks that live like a subsistence life,
*  you know, people that have gone to the woods and they just live off the land.
*  They talk about this like deep connection to nature that they get from that
*  and how it makes them feel fulfilled.
*  You don't feel depressed.
*  They feel very engaged.
*  And, you know, there's a guy named Haimo.
*  He lives in the Arctic and Vice did this whole series on him called the Haimo's Arctic Adventure.
*  And one of the things that he was saying is he came out there like in the 1970s
*  to work for the forestry department and just lived there for the rest of his life.
*  He's up there right now with his family.
*  Look, he's married to this indigenous woman and they live off the land.
*  He eats caribou and fish and his whole life is like hunting and gathering.
*  But he's like, this is how people are supposed to live.
*  He's a very intelligent man, very articulate.
*  So when you hear him talk, he's not some weirdo that lives in the woods.
*  He's a guy who recognizes like there's something about this that resonates with humans.
*  This life, this like being you're connected in the way that you're supposed to be.
*  And he thinks that what we've done by creating cities and electricity and electronics and,
*  you know, social media and all the bullshit that we deal with today,
*  that we've disconnected ourselves from the things that really make us human.
*  I believe that.
*  His life is more connected to it, but there's even a deeper connection.
*  And that's how the Navi lived.
*  And, you know, if you read about there's many stories about Native Americans where they would,
*  especially the Comanche, would kidnap people.
*  They would kidnap like young children.
*  Oh, that great book.
*  Which one?
*  Under the Harvest Moon.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Do yourself a favor.
*  I will.
*  Empire of the Summer Moon, which one that I'm talking about.
*  That's the one, sorry.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah, same one.
*  Yeah.
*  About, yeah, Cynthia Ann Parker.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  It's one of my favorite books.
*  There's a photo of her out there in the lobby.
*  That's who that is.
*  That's Cynthia Ann Parker.
*  I knew it from somewhere.
*  Yeah.
*  That's Quanah Parker.
*  That's her son.
*  That guy over there, the one that's made out of bullet shells.
*  That's one of my favorite books ever.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  Amazing book.
*  It's amazing.
*  And that's one of the things they said is that she did not want to go back to Western civilization.
*  She's like, you guys live like idiots.
*  Like, this is a bullshit way to live.
*  There's something about that movie that tapped into that, but also tapped into this, like,
*  spiritual realm that exists in psychedelics.
*  Cameron fucking nailed it, man.
*  He nailed it.
*  And a lot of people are like, oh, that movie's just-
*  Have you ever had him on?
*  No.
*  No.
*  I'd love to.
*  He's the great, first of all, he's the most humble.
*  I've never worked with him, but my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who passed away a few years
*  ago, Bill Paxton.
*  I love that guy.
*  He's the best.
*  Oh, he felt good.
*  He was one of my best friends.
*  And he and Jim were in Roger Corman's production mill together.
*  They were both like standby painters.
*  So he's been in every Jim Cameron movie ever, ever made.
*  And he introduced me to Jim.
*  And there was a minute where I was going to play the Billy Zane part in Titanic.
*  And Jim is, he's like, there's no one like him.
*  There's literally nobody like him.
*  The fucking guy went to the bottom of the ocean.
*  So Bill and he went to, because Bill's like, goddamn, Jim's taking me down to the Titanic.
*  I'm going next Thursday.
*  And they went down to the Titanic.
*  They had lunch on the deck of the fucking Titanic.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then Bill came up and everybody was like ashen faced and freaking out.
*  And 9-11 had happened.
*  Bill Paxton was on the deck of the Titanic when 9-11 happened.
*  Holy shit.
*  With Jim Cameron.
*  Is that crazy?
*  Oh my God.
*  That's insane.
*  Insane.
*  That's insane.
*  That's insane.
*  But I'm dying to see these new Avatar movies.
*  I know.
*  When are they supposed to happen?
*  I mean, everything's all fucked up now because of COVID, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I heard they keep getting pushed and pushed and pushed, but he's bet the farm on them.
*  I mean, he's the one guy, he's the guy.
*  Like there are very few people that could get me to go to a movie theater anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd do anything for that guy's movies.
*  Maybe Chris Nolan, maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  Another one.
*  But for sure, James Cameron.
*  Bill Paxton was in one of the most underrated vampire movies of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  After Dark.
*  After Dark.
*  Remember that?
*  He's great in it.
*  That's a movie.
*  No, people don't, they don't remember that.
*  That was a fucking great vampire movie.
*  He's a...
*  Budget.
*  One billion.
*  I mean, only James Cameron.
*  But that's for three movies, too.
*  But still.
*  By the way, it'll make a billion dollars within six months.
*  The first one.
*  And maybe even streaming, it might make a billion dollars.
*  Like even if it came out today.
*  Best deal in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  I love, I hate to say this because I love movies, and I do love going to the movie theater, but
*  the fucking consequences of going to the movie theater are dealing with people.
*  Like people that are texting or talking.
*  No, I won't do it.
*  That's what drove me out of the movie theaters was the glow of people's phones.
*  When that started, I was out.
*  Well, people talking too is so annoying.
*  But when people are not annoying, like, you know, the nine out of 10 times, it's fucking
*  amazing because you feel the energy of all the other people, especially at comedy.
*  Like I remember I went to see Team America World Police.
*  With me, my friend Eddie Bravo and a bunch of other friends.
*  We were baked out of our fucking mind.
*  And we went to see that in a crowded theater.
*  We were dying and everyone was dying.
*  There were so many people laughing.
*  It was like the energy.
*  It was like being in a comedy club.
*  The energy of all the other people in the film.
*  In the theater.
*  Borat was the last one for me.
*  It was like that.
*  Where the minute the credits started with the music in it, I was the whole.
*  That was one of my favorite.
*  But Team America, come on.
*  God.
*  Yeah.
*  Those guys, those guys are national treasures.
*  They're national treasures.
*  Yeah.
*  The doll is still they're one of the one groups of people that can avoid cancel culture
*  because their creations are these things that aren't even people.
*  These like weird little cartoons.
*  You can kill them.
*  They can.
*  They could say outrageous shit.
*  They can do everything they want.
*  It's like the perfect vehicle for mocking culture.
*  You've seen that great YouTube clip where they're in the recording studio.
*  They're in the recording booth.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And they're doing the.
*  What is it called?
*  Like six days or something like that.
*  So good.
*  It's I've never met them.
*  They're it's funny.
*  It's like they're awesome though.
*  What I love is having people still at this point in my life that I'm huge fan of that
*  I haven't met because and then I hope.
*  My better that way.
*  Keep them.
*  Well you know what's really like that for me is people I don't like because as a sports fan
*  you got to have villains.
*  Right.
*  So like I remember not wanting to meet Larry Bird because I'm a Lakers fan and I don't
*  and I never wanted to meet really who I really didn't want to meet was Danny Ainge.
*  And of course I met him and he was fucking awesome and I'm like fuck like who am I going
*  to hate now as a comic.
*  It's a real problem because if you meet someone you really like them you can't make fun of
*  them anymore.
*  I got met Jenny McCarthy once and she was so nice I had to cut her out of my act.
*  Oh no.
*  I had a bit about her where they said she was going to take her breast implants out
*  and I said that's like Tiger Woods chopping his fucking arms off.
*  I go put him back in and make them bigger and no talking.
*  It was so mean but then I met her and she was so nice.
*  She was so friendly and pretty.
*  You know that great story Spade tells about he did that he used to do the Hollywood Minute
*  on Weekend Update.
*  It was the meanest funniest thing we'd make fun of celebrities and at one point
*  we all have down times in our career.
*  It's an honor to have a fallow time in your career because it means you've been around.
*  Yeah sure.
*  And Eddie Murphy had been in a fallow time and Spade in the middle of an update had Eddie
*  Murphy's picture come up on the screen and went oh look kids a falling star.
*  And within five minutes the phone was ringing on Studio 8H and it was Eddie.
*  Oh my god.
*  For Spade.
*  Oh my god.
*  Yeah I mean I'm telling a story only because Spade publicly tells it and it's amazing but like.
*  What did Eddie Murphy say to him?
*  He went fucking nuts.
*  But Spade tells a great story of like trying to avoid the call and like running and ducking.
*  I mean you know Spade is like a tiny little will of the wisp.
*  He's so small.
*  Yeah you got that's the thing is like you know.
*  It's good to keep some people at a distance so you can continue to root against them let's face it.
*  Well my friend Bill Burr was talking about that the other day.
*  He was on his podcast he does with Burt Kreischer and they were talking about meeting a president.
*  He goes I don't want to meet a president.
*  He goes why because then he can't make fun of him.
*  He was talking about his bit about Michelle Obama and he has this amazing bit about Michelle Obama
*  and you know and he's like if I met her I couldn't do that bit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's right you couldn't.
*  You feel bad you feel like oh I'm throwing her under the bus she's a nice lady.
*  That's why Spade stopped doing Hollywood Minute.
*  He just couldn't do it anymore and it was like a big big deal big big franchise of Weekend Update.
*  Yeah yeah that's part of the problem.
*  But it's you know it is it is what it is.
*  That's right and also somebody was telling me
*  that we're with emoji culture and text culture that are that our language our language has
*  changed forever for sure because now no one cares about punctuation.
*  I mean it's just true no no one cares does not look down upon it is is it isn't a sign of lack
*  of education anymore.
*  It has no pejorative attached to it and I was sort of bemoaning that and somebody said no no no the
*  point of language is for it to become to for it to evolve and to become for lack of a better
*  better and what if you read the letters from the Civil War right those great like flowery beautiful
*  that like the most you know like a private in the army would write.
*  Right.
*  Now today the private in the army is sending a three second text but that's progress because
*  it actually requires less time you get the same information and it's you haven't had to go through
*  the time and effort of the other at least that was the the theory that somebody's telling me
*  it made me feel better about it.
*  I don't know if that theory is correct that's like saying that people who read texts all day
*  and they read tweets and bullshit nonsense on social media that's better than reading books
*  because I don't think it's true.
*  But it's probably not.
*  It's just easier.
*  It's probably not I'm just trying to feel better about the culture today.
*  I'm hopeful about the culture today but there's more challenges there's more more information more
*  things so there's more challenges but I don't think that's necessarily bad it's just you're
*  gonna you're still a brilliant people you're just gonna have it's easier to be a moron today and
*  survive you know back in the Civil War days you know if you're writing a letter back home I mean
*  I wonder what education was like back then too right I mean it was probably it couldn't have
*  been great yeah no it couldn't have been but you know that that famous letter of Sullivan
*  Ballew that ends the the first episode of Ken Burns documentary the Civil War that's famous
*  and they put that beautiful song underneath it it's like I know it's crazy to read the way they
*  wrote oh so flowery yeah so eloquent so eloquent so moving and it was like a piece of art and
*  that was just a regular dude writing home to his wife yeah if someone wrote like that home to their
*  wife their friends would read and go I think your husband's game what was the name Sullivan Ballew
*  wasn't Jim what is Sullivan into musicals or yes bye-bye birdie fan what's this thing nothing
*  wrong with it no judgment it's yeah it's I think there's just more challenges today because there's
*  there is more information coming in you can get lost in junk food information you know you can get
*  lost and what's your current like YouTube wormhole you're into because that's all I do at night it's
*  like people people wonder why viewership is down and listen you know I I'm in the TV business I
*  should be watching TV I don't watch TV I go to YouTube and I go down the worm whatever wormhole
*  I'm interested in on that particular day I go to YouTube almost entirely for escape so I watch I
*  watch pool like professional pool matches on YouTube yeah I do a lot of that I watch car videos yeah I
*  watch dumb shit I watch things that don't require that much thinking but then every now and then I'll
*  watch like a lot of space documentaries if I if there's one thing that I watch a lot it's
*  documentaries on space things about space space travel exploration new things they're learning
*  I was reading something today about NASA they're gonna change some of their wording to be more
*  inclusive I'm like please say they're not gonna get rid of black holes because if NASA decides
*  that black holes are racist I'm gonna give up it you know anything's possible today everything
*  is possible I've been into my my new thing is uh of all things Simon and Garfunkel oh wow yeah those
*  harmonies and stuff and but I'm a huge yacht rock guy before yeah I before yacht rock was a thing
*  I didn't know that was a genre an official genre but like yacht rock yeah oh so you this is a new
*  phrase for you too is it yeah oh well then I don't feel as behind there's a there's an actual channel
*  on SiriusXM for yacht rock no yes what does that mean so yacht rock is like the eagle well the the
*  eagles Boz Skaggs Al Stewart's year of the cat okay look at this the term yacht rock does not
*  exist contemporaneously with with the music term describes huh with the music the term describes
*  from about 1975 to 1984 it refers to adult oriented rock or west coast sound which became
*  identified with yacht rock in 2005 when the term was coined in a JD Reisner et al's online video
*  series of the same name oh so one guy came up with the name so who are the bands of yacht rock
*  let's see what this is okay Michael oh Michael McDonald for sure 10 cc every cross I I'm a big
*  yacht rock fan Kenny Logg Toto Steely Dan yes I love my I love Steely Dan they might be my favorite
*  band so yacht rock is like oh another thing another thing I'm into is um um Don uh Donald
*  Fagan talking music theory is really really amazing talking about chord progressions and stuff
*  oh I don't do you play I wish I did I played I played I know five chords on a guitar oh I don't
*  know one I don't know anything yeah I know like five open chords I can't when I get to bar chords
*  my little fingers were too weak and I had to move on I think music is one of those things when I'm
*  I'm scared to learn because if I start getting into it I'll be obsessed and then I'll lose all
*  the time that I have then you're gonna start a band you'll be like you know you'll be like every
*  actor with their band I wonder who has the best actor band like I want to see Jared Leto right
*  he's pro for sure 100 but that's a legit I was in a teen magazine with him
*  were you yeah and like 1993 I think wow yeah the Bacon Brothers they're great Kevin Bacon
*  Kevin Bacon's band right that's right he's got a great you know who's legit Juliette Lewis
*  Juliette Lewis can sing her fucking ass off Bill Burr told me about her he calls him he goes dude
*  he goes let me tell you something she's a fucking rock star he goes a legit rock star I'm like come
*  on and then he sent me a video I was like holy fuck I've always been a huge fan of hers she's a
*  beast she's so good she pours it out man she there she is but is she look at her what is she's
*  wearing evil Knievels out there yes she's fucking good that's some Snake River Canyon shit she's
*  got on her and I've talked about doing a podcast but we never really got to do it I love her I
*  don't know her at all love her though she's a fucking amazing actress man her and uh Cape Fear
*  oh yeah dude that's a movie you couldn't make could make that movie today no chance yep no chance
*  when she sucked on Robert De Niro's thumb in a playhouse she sucked on his thumb in a child's
*  playhouse she was like what 15 at the time or something yeah oh god damn yeah he couldn't do
*  that today there's so many films you couldn't do today that movie is great how about when De Niro
*  smokes that cigar in the theater he was terrifying such an actor oh my god he's amazing he's a beast
*  but what was the other thing it was um the one with uh Woody Harrelson when there were serial killers
*  um yeah yeah yeah the with natural thank you yeah god damn she was good in that
*  so good yeah yeah Oliver Stone it's Oliver Stone isn't it yep that's Oliver Stone what I yeah
*  I got to meet him did a podcast with him a couple weeks ago he's oh I saw it he's a man he's great
*  he's an interesting cat he's an interesting we did um there was a minute where he was going to make
*  the uh Noriega manual noriega story it was going to be um Al Pacino was going to play noriega and
*  I was going to play Oliver North whoa and it never happened the script was good but not great and we
*  did a big table reading of it um at Oliver's place and um Oliver's known to be really tough on actors
*  and I'd never worked with him but so we take a break halfway through and I go to the water fountain
*  and Oliver's at the water fountain and I turn to him and go what do you think how's it going he went
*  I don't know what do you mean you don't know he goes I don't know Rob I just was um just a little
*  surprised what do you mean he goes I just thought you'd have a little more energy
*  he turned away and walked away whoa so when we came back the next line I had I was doing it like
*  this with so much motherfucking energy it was unbelievable and Oliver just kind of like laughed
*  talking to him was so fascinating because he's one of the few guys that's made films about
*  combat who's actually experienced real combat and you know talking about his experiences in Vietnam
*  and then coming back home and making platoon and how difficult it was yeah to make platoon
*  what a fucking masterpiece it was people forget Salvador's great oh my god Jim Belushi yeah people
*  forgot how good Jimmy Belushi's in Salvador and James Woods Midnight Express dude that guy made
*  some fucking wicked movies Alan Parker who directed it died this week you know oh did he yeah he's
*  one of my favorite directors did Pink Floyd the Wall Bugsy Malone wow um and uh and Stone is so
*  weird too because he wrote so many great movies like Scarface he wrote great movies and produced
*  and directed he did so much man so much JFK he's such a um an iconoclast I mean they would I don't
*  know if a guy like him could make it through the corporation well also the way he partied too
*  oh believe me I was doing a movie called Masquerade in New York City when they were making
*  Wall Street and we would always be like our set would be like three blocks from their set and
*  Charlie and I of course grew up together and it would be it was just it was be Michael Douglas
*  an old boy those days the dark days yeah the darkness it was accepted yeah what was a part
*  of the culture right it was 100% a part of it's what it's what you did we did isn't it weird now
*  that that's so demonized you're not doing it any of it yeah any of it and look it's it's obviously
*  for the better um it's definitely for the better for the victims
*  but is it for the better for the creators I don't know here's my thing I really believe that the
*  notion that getting high makes you a better artist or gives you better access into your art I
*  think is bullshit I do you might be right but you might not be right I know I might not there's
*  some art that's made by people that are fucked up that's insane I know I know some of Stephen
*  King's writings when he was when he was drinking when he's drinking the shining yeah shining
*  Kujo Carey I think I think it was Kujo or Carey he doesn't even remember writing he was so fucked
*  up just doing coke and drinking cases of beer look the Beatles you know in their acid phase I mean
*  Hendrix you're not gonna you can't you can't deny it I think that you just don't they would have
*  made something else it would have been different but I think it would have been maybe is good I
*  don't think it's a pre I think people who treat it as a prerequisite um I think that's a mistake I
*  agree I agree with that you know well I know brilliant people that are completely sober so I
*  100 agree but I don't think you can deny the impact that some drugs have on some creativity
*  for sure it's yeah I mean you know what would you know what if Crosby Stills and Nash never
*  smoked dope what if the Grateful Dead never smoked dope or did acid or did acid maybe the music would
*  be good sorry I'm with you I don't I don't get I don't get it there's a lot of people that love
*  the dead what about fish isn't fish like that basically the same band right I don't know to me
*  I don't have that gene there's this white person gene that I don't possess the fish gene yeah there's
*  like dirty feet gene we just want to like dance around in a field with your friends while you
*  wear beads now I have a cousin who followed the dead she followed the dead all over the country
*  she like lived with the dead and in terms of like the fans like sold they made food and sold it to
*  people that would go to the to the concerts they'd like scramble eggs and shit I don't
*  yeah do you ever go to Burning Man no any desire maybe maybe now that you can wear a mask
*  and hide from people I don't it's it's an it's an excuse to take drugs and kind of be sexually
*  provocative right am I missing something there's definitely that there's I think there's also like
*  this freedom of this alternative civilization that they develop in this wasteland you know I
*  have friends that love it and they love it here people by the way who are really like you go really
*  really successful people I know a lot of the tech dorks they love it yeah yeah I just feel like it's
*  a lot of dust I have genius friends that love it a lot of dust a lot of dirtiness yeah I'm good
*  I mean people like you have to go I'm like I don't know if I do what are the other things that people
*  tell you you have to do that you don't want like do you want it like it's like you have to go to
*  India it's so moving like I don't know is it I feel like I'm getting sick already thinking about
*  I feel like my stomach hurts now yeah I can feel the diarrhea brewing before I get on the plane
*  I mean I don't know I mean uh I've heard people say India was amazing and I've heard people say
*  they wanted to leave the moment they got off the plane I know people who've done both yeah
*  yeah I want to go to Egypt I would really like to see the pyramids me too I'm desperate to do
*  that whole thing but I want to go with someone I want to find the person who's the expert on all
*  of it I had the expert he just died no John Anthony West and he and I had talked a couple
*  times about even getting together with a group of my friends and going over there and he was
*  going to guide us he's a he's what you would determine you would he's a guy that inspired
*  a lot of Graham Hancock's work he collaborated together on some stuff that's why I know the name
*  yeah he's he's amazing that's my that's my dream trip yeah 100 it's a mind fuck I'm sure
*  I mean I haven't the closest I've been is Chichen Itza I've seen the Mayan pyramids and that was a
*  mindfuck have you been to Machu Picchu no haven't so I went two years ago and I thought it would be
*  like that great scene in National Lampoon's vacation when Chevy Chase sees the Grand Canyon
*  where he goes he goes okay and leaves do you know what I mean like I saw it that was great I'm done
*  I really thought that's what it would be and it was it was fucking amazing yeah amazing it's pretty
*  crazy first of all you you have to walk there you you can take a train to the base of it and then
*  walk up and by the way when people say I walked it sometimes they're talking about walking from
*  the train yeah you got to take the Inca trail we didn't do the four day version that's too much
*  there's no reason to do it but we did like the eight hour and it it makes all the difference
*  it was just look at it and we caught it with that type of weather too god damn that's beautiful
*  it's and they don't really understand the civilization that built that no and what what
*  you realize when you get there is there's two civilizations there's that and then there are
*  parts of that that are even older that look completely different completely different like
*  any idiot can tell that that's from a different time yeah that's one of the things that Graham
*  Hancock talks about is that there's a bunch of these spots like there where archaeologists have
*  sort of determined that well this is what happened and then upon further examination other people
*  said but wait I don't I don't know if this is right like and I don't know why they did this
*  like you see with these people you see even in that photo we're looking at you see the kind of
*  it looks like little stone brick area which is like 80 percent of what we're seeing that's really
*  what it looks like but then you get in there and there's other areas that look nothing like it with
*  that crazy right angle seamless stones that you see all over the rest of the world yeah that this
*  was clearly built on top of I mean you can you just it obviously was yeah well that's the that's the
*  argument see that wall that those that's the arguments see how it's different than the wall
*  over there totally different look at the steps Jesus Christ look at those those green covered
*  steps so what those were where the crops were that that's where they grew the crops god it's
*  fucking great you think you worry about going all the way there and being like I slept all the way
*  there for this it's totally rewarding on the other side of it I went to the Galapagos and that was I
*  would recommend just go to Catalina really yeah really yeah it's fucking Catalina dude is it really
*  yes it's an island it's the Channel Island well they call the Channel Islands the Galapagos of North
*  America do they they do for good reason when you go to the Galapagos you're like wait I'm sorry
*  this is San Miguel Island off of Santa Barbara that's hilarious they do but if you're into the
*  blue-footed booby you gotta go there you're one of those guys and if you want to like swim with
*  those gnarly lizards that are under like gigantic like monitor lizards that are underwater like
*  eh when you're snorkeling you're not getting that at Catalina right you gotta go to Galapagos
*  gotta go to Galapagos there they are those fuckers are underwater how big is you swim with them how
*  big are they from it's the this table from me to you Jesus Christ oh my god look at the size of
*  those fuckers they're great what a weird looking creature it's it's it's really something oh my god
*  that part was way worth it whoa look at that guy scared and then the big obviously the Galapagos
*  tortoises you're only going to get there and they're you know they don't even know how old they are
*  look at those fuckers yeah it's a long way to go though yeah how long did it take you to get there
*  um it's it's a full day it's a full day and a half travel wow there's something about going places
*  well i mean i'm sure that's fascinating but there's something about going places where people lived a
*  long time ago that's very eerie like if you go to like um Pompeii was weird for me because you're
*  you're looking around and you realize like this is this civilization that what was it a thousand
*  years ago or whatever yeah that mount vasuvius erupted yep that just instantaneously vanished
*  i never got to Pompeii i know people who just had the same experience a trip because you know you're
*  looking at like this like rome is like that as well like just being around the Vatican and seeing
*  just the the the how much would you love to have free reign of the Vatican take me to them to the
*  Indiana Jones vault you know the end where everything's stored yeah what do you think they
*  have that they don't show us the ark they have the thing i really want is is they say is the um
*  the library of alexandria that burned you know in which had ever yeah that had all of the
*  all the knowledge of the world there people say that a lot of it got moved out and is
*  it that in the Vatican the Vatican is a weird place man um i went with a guy who was a scholar
*  he was a professor who uh he was really a very great he was a great guide you know he's one of
*  those professional guys that you hire and um he and i hit it off big time because we were we're
*  out in this uh courtyard area and there was this giant pine cone and uh and i said the pine cone and
*  he looked at me i go is that representative of the pineal gland and his eyes lit up he's like yes
*  and then next thing you know me and him are talking about drugs when we're talking about
*  you know the the understanding of the pineal gland the seat of the soul like that thing
*  is supposed to represent the pineal gland that's supposed that's not just a pine cone it's supposed
*  to represent the gland in your brain that produces dimethyltryptamine and so there's there's a lot of
*  that weird shit in ancient christian art like mushroom imagery and a lot of like weird stuff
*  that you find and in fact there's a book by this guy john marco allegro who was a biblical scholar
*  and a linguist and he was also one of the only people in the dead sea scrolls the translation
*  commission the translation group that was uh that was assigned to try to figure out this dead sea
*  scrolls and and translate it back that was he was an ordained minister but he was also agnostic
*  because through his studies of religion he sort of decided along the way like hey this is all
*  it seems like there's there's too many similarities to these things it's not in all these different
*  cultures and he started breaking down the etymology of the languages and he came out with a book
*  called the sacred mushroom and the cross that was bought out by the catholic church
*  and the book essentially said the entire religion of christianity is a giant misunderstanding
*  and what it really was about was about the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms
*  and fertility rituals and that they had all these stories that they hid in parables and all this
*  ancient knowledge that they hid in these tales but that it all goes back to the consumption of
*  psychedelic drugs and in fact one of the the weirder connections to that was in in israel i mean this
*  is like very recently these scholars at the university of jerusalem had determined that
*  what moses was talking about when he saw the burning bush was actually the acacia bush the
*  acacia tree which was rich in dmt and that when we're talking about the burning bush and that
*  was god appeared to him in the burning bush he was probably tripping and that this was why he
*  came down with these commandments for how to live life and how to how to govern yourself that he was
*  in communication with god but what it really was most likely was him having a psychedelic experience
*  wow that is all through ancient christian religion you know there was a a guy named jack harrow who's
*  like one of the one of the early um proponents of marijuana he was like a gold water republican
*  who got high with a girlfriend of his got went through a divorce got high with a girlfriend of
*  his and had this idea of like marijuana being this terrible thing these fucking hippies are all lazy
*  and but he meets this cool girl and he starts smoking pot and then became a pot activist
*  and wrote a book called the emperor has no clothes and it's all about the origins of marijuana
*  criminalization and what it really was all about and that it actually was about industry
*  and that the the real people that started marijuana propaganda like the like those movies
*  like reefer madness that was harry anslinger and william randolph hearst and william randolph
*  hearst decided that he was going to demonize marijuana to stop the hemp industry that was
*  the original reason why he did it because the popular science magazine had a cover in like 1937
*  or something like that called hemp the new billion dollar crop and it was all because they had come
*  up with a new machine called the decorticator and a decorticator was a new machine that allowed them
*  to effectively process hemp fiber because before they used to use slaves and then when slavery was
*  outlawed and then elai whitney came up with the cotton gin they switched all their their clothing
*  from hemp based clothing to cotton and so they had done this for years and then they had switched
*  their paper from canvas like original canvas like even the monalisa was printed on hemp all that
*  stuff was hemp hemp is a far more durable paper and it's a far more durable cloth and so people's
*  clothes like the like old like really durable clothing was made out of hemp and so william
*  randolph hearst decided the best way to combat this new industry instead of turning over his
*  gigantic forests and converting them to hemp forests and converting his paper mills to hemp
*  paper he decided what he was going to do was kill the business and so the way he killed the business
*  was printing these stories about black people and mexicans raping white women because they were on
*  this new drug called marijuana and what marijuana the word was actually a slang for a mexican wild
*  tobacco didn't even have anything to do with cannabis so when they made marijuana illegal
*  congress didn't even understand that they were making cannabis and hemp illegal they thought it
*  was a new drug and so he tricked them he tricked them because he he earned hearst publications
*  i mean that was one of the things that orson wells like when he made rosebud yeah he made that movie
*  he made citizen cain about william randolph hearst yes because he was this insanely powerful guy
*  that was just as fucking as rosebud i don't know like i don't know but but that movie was about
*  william randolph hearst william randolph hearst is the reason why marijuana is still federally
*  illegal in 2020 and this is in the 1930s like almost a hundred years later his propaganda
*  still works that it is amazing because i that's you ever been to hearst castle that's cool yeah
*  yeah i was there when i was a kid it's crazy he's the reason why this whole fucking state is filled
*  with wild pigs that crazy asshole had wild pigs on his mansion he had him roaming around brought
*  wild boars over from europe and so california like san jose is infested with wild pigs people
*  who live in san jose they go out wild pigs are fucking knocking over their trash and eating
*  their lawn that's william randolph hearst did that shit i had no idea that's amazing that crazy
*  fuck was responsible for a lot of problems that we're still facing today i had no idea i mean i
*  i mean i know that i know it my knowledge is i know the yellow journalism of it all and the
*  he's a bad guy he was a fucking bad guy he had too much power i mean there was there was he
*  hearst publications was you know he had this insane amount of power to just print lies and he could
*  shift the course of public perception to fit his own needs and to fit his businesses i wonder if
*  that happened today no way media what that would be like like uh fake like fake news or something i
*  can't imagine can't do that today people are too smart no could never do that today would never
*  happen yeah it's it's it's amazing when you find out the history of why things are legal and illegal
*  and what happened and where they went wrong you know it's just it's weird how long some things
*  like some propaganda can sink in and last for it's crazy yeah i mean that entertainment is the
*  ultimate form of it oh yeah the ultimate and also the ultimate form of combating it which is what
*  you know orson welles tried to do with citizen cain kind of show like and you know obviously
*  didn't name the guy william randolph hearst but everybody knew what it was about that movie is
*  great it's one of those movies that you hear is what's up jamie i started looking something up
*  about the pigs and this article from the san francisco gate says it's a different guy named
*  george gordon moore who brought them in the 1920s for hunting um i'm sure he did but william randolph
*  hearst most certainly had them at his castle maybe maybe some of the ones around that area
*  came from william randolph hearst castle maybe that's where he got him from that guy but hearst
*  most certainly had them at his place in fact hunter s thompson used to hunt william randolph
*  hearst wild pigs the ones that are around big sir apparently that's what people think that's
*  another gnarly place that's a gnarly place that's a place that also like did you see the fucking
*  landslide they got yes shut down the 101 or the one for like i just drove the one cch i just drove
*  the one two weeks ago up there and you cannot believe how much new construction they needed to
*  it's open now it's open now but was closed for like a year yeah right i mean when you look at
*  the construction you go well i can see why this took a year dude i drove up there with my family
*  once and i was so terrified i was like to the left is death yeah it's amazing it's crazy that
*  you could just drive it it's crazy it is one of the great it's one of the great drives it's a cliff
*  you're on the edge of a cliff and if you're on the right side and someone just decides to turn into
*  you you're done you're dead but you're like you're like 1500 feet up yeah and people die there all the
*  time all the time yeah all the time you fall asleep at the wheel you're fucked yeah you're
*  turning around to get that selfie it's a crazy way to die someone died like that in malibu not
*  that long ago it's like paris hilton's photographer or something like that so it was he was a
*  photographer the guy in the jeep is this guy in the jeep i don't remember but there was someone
*  who he posted something on social media and he was dead right afterwards and that their
*  speculation was that he was looking at his phone when he went off the side
*  yeah i remember hearing this yeah i know that there's that there are a couple turns right there
*  in malibu that you know right below yeah sketchy as fuck yeah you're like california like that ride
*  up to san francisco on the pch is fucking magnificent though it's so incredible it is
*  it's not magnificent if you're in the back seat it is not you will get the car sickness of a
*  lifetime yeah there's a lot of i drove i drove a winnebago once and you know the famous bridge
*  that's in every car commercial on the one yeah i didn't realize that all the bikes that i had in
*  the back were like too wide i guess i just i destroyed every bike we had just gotten the
*  family for christmas on that thing it's like you don't want i was like clark griswold vacation
*  driving that fucking thing was not good yeah people have that idea right we're going to take
*  an rv and go across america there's good things to that but there's also you know your kids have
*  to have a high tolerance for boredom i remember when my family would drive me across the country
*  i'd have my book and mad libs and that was it that's it that's it yeah you didn't have anything else i
*  was watching a movie on my ipad i was watching malan yeah kids have a different they have a
*  different kind of traveling now and people let them do it i've let my kids do it just to shut
*  them up just so you get some peace they wear you down yeah they beat you down there's no way he
*  makes you hair read a book and do some mad libs from here to pocahontas idaho how long when are
*  we going to be there i have to pee i'm hungry oh brutal yeah brutal but you got to kind of force
*  them to have some boredom like just just so they have those experiences they like i remember when
*  my parents took me to yosemite when i was a kid and to this day i still i remember those experiences
*  i remember our cooler got broken into by a bear i remember hearing the bear outside the tent and
*  waking up and there was footprints on the hood of the car so good i remember that's my big worry is
*  that as a culture we don't know what to do with boredom you know because we're never without the
*  world at our fingertips yes you know so like i remember my mom i've such vivid memories of
*  this parents would never do this today but like take we'd go to the market and she would leave
*  me in the car and she would go to the market and it felt like she was gone for five days she's
*  probably looking back on it she was probably gone for 20 minutes but it felt like forever and i'm in
*  that car as a little boy i can remember it vividly and all i have is my mind and my imagination to
*  kill the time that's it yeah and you know i think it's it served me very well but i don't know how
*  many of us are getting that experience today not too many i mean grown adults are very rarely bored
*  these days and i think that that leads to a real problem with like creativity and imagination
*  and also social media anxiety and all the the nonsense that comes with just reading people's
*  anger and the just the way we i'm off i'm off twitter i don't i still have a presence on it
*  and i still use use it from here to the bit i'm i'm um i had to good thought and i didn't do the
*  thing that makes me crazy is it's like i'm leaving twitter everyone it's like shut the fuck up exactly
*  just go just go yeah do you know and then you check to see how people are reacting to you leaving
*  twitter yeah let me see what the how that what kind of interest that post generated yeah i just
*  and i'm way happier there's so many people that are just so addicted to saying something and seeing
*  how people react to it what's trending i loved it i love checking what's trending on twitter's
*  fucking best yeah it's just in this time and age too with trump it's just a terrible time
*  because everyone's so angry you go on twitter and just people are so furious they're just
*  you can't have an opinion about anything everybody's mad if you do have an opinion
*  there's a million people that disagree and a million people that do agree and they're
*  fighting it out to the death yeah it used to be that um consensus building or or being in in the
*  middle of the the road was accepted by the warring camps right and now um that's it's
*  silence is is complicit yes yes so that so that's that's really the problem that's what there's no
*  there's no middle anymore right people are angry at you if you don't post an opinion that agrees
*  with them like you can't even have you can't even not post an opinion they'll get mad at you
*  i've heard people say you know hey history will not be kind to the people that did not talk about
*  this like really like what what you can't tell people that they have to comment on things that's
*  ridiculous you're you're forcing people to express opinions that they might not have even formed
*  yeah it's a it's a it's a i mean i have these talks with my boys because they're right in the
*  think of it there it's a new generation obviously and and they have a totally different perspective
*  on it um they're growing up with it they don't even know what it's like to have no internet
*  now it's amazing that's what's crazy isn't it it's crazy i remember i remember vividly like
*  like when it all happened i remember like i was on the west wing and like all of a sudden we had
*  went from pagers to blackberries i remember the first the first person ever showed me an iphone
*  was david crosby of all people oh wow yeah and i was like what is that thing you've got there
*  and he had the one of the first iphones i wouldn't i was a late adopter because i was like that's
*  bullshit i want buttons i was late at same i wanted buttons and i thought that it was somehow
*  an iphone was less serious than a blackberry right i'm really business person i'm i'm a serious
*  person yes i'm not i'm not you know and and and then i i um obviously succumbed everybody that i
*  work with on news radio had the blackberry that was the wide one that you did the two finger one
*  yes you know everyone's doing the email off of it it's very important to have a blackberry very
*  blackberry yes and then they were called they were called something else
*  in the east east coast really yeah it was like a rim rim was the company and that's a that's one
*  of those great i want to i would love to do an anthropological look at how they get the clock
*  cleaned they had it oh yeah they had it they had it all yeah they all said that about iphone someday
*  yeah somebody will come up but like what how do you how does it's like via vhs betamax yeah it's like
*  who who is this darwinism of the corporations is so interesting to me well we remember blockbuster
*  video oh yeah who would have ever thought there would be no video stores who would have ever
*  thought that i thought it was a novelty the idea you're gonna have things on a hard drive like that
*  i know it's ridiculous i remember the first person telling me i have my music on my computer
*  i said what do you mean if your music on the computer you said yeah no i don't have any cds
*  they're all here i hope but where are your cds i don't have any but wait wait like it shows you
*  this is why we need ayahuasca because we can't understand simple shit like that well the real
*  question is what's next that's the real question like what are what are we blind to that our children
*  are you go remember back then when people streamed their music and streamed their movies
*  their movies like my dad i'm like dad have you heard my podcast no where do i get them
*  i mean my dad literally and then he finally his wife found the my podcast and he goes and then
*  this is my favorite goes and then somebody called him but i didn't know how to shut it off and now i
*  can't find it again i'm like jesus christ my parents didn't know about my podcast it'd be awesome
*  do you get do you get people gel i can't believe you said that yeah my wife listens now that's a
*  problem oh it's my wife could care fucking less about anything that's great she does
*  fucking perfect my wife's like i like that one you did with them like oh what did i say
*  shut i know well that's the problem with doing podcasts is you you it's a conversation it's not
*  an interview so you forget the point is to forget yeah you talk a lot of shit talk a lot of shit
*  yeah you get especially you get loose and then you're having fun and you talk like you would
*  you're basically like i don't really have a private voice and a public voice right i just talk this is
*  if you and i were hanging out and there was no one around i would have the same conversation with
*  you 100 that's the problem it's the it's the problem but that's what you that's the point
*  that's why people like it that's the point yeah that's why people like podcasts what give me one
*  piece of advice i need to know i'm seven episodes i'm eight episodes in to exactly what you did
*  right here you're gonna be great you're awesome at it you think just talk yeah you're a genuine
*  person you're honest genuine person that's what resonates with people it's like someone expressing
*  their real feelings and thoughts about stuff right yeah that's that's what we're missing you
*  know what's missing in overproduced stuff that executives and a team of people come up with
*  that you're missing the real the the thing that resonates with people like you can listen there's
*  a lot of podcasts that i love that are produced like radio lab or wonder i love wondering i love
*  the stuff they put out and it's very produced but it's different it's different between what people
*  people listen to us right now they probably feel like they're in the room they're having this
*  conversation too like they're agreeing or they're disagreeing or they're yelling shut the fuck up
*  while they're driving you know that's that's that's what the appeal is is that it's not
*  in like this is small crew of people that produces this it's basically the jamie and myself and the
*  video editors i mean that's it there's no one else so because of that it's not it's not fucked with
*  and i know a lot of people that have podcasts on networks you know and then they have to they
*  have meetings i go you have fucking meetings and then they tell me the nightmare meetings they have
*  where people like well they tune out when you say this and they do this like here's the stats
*  you can't talk about that because if you do oh my god no really like you look at that stuff like you
*  can't look at that stuff how do you know if it's not good i fucking hate everything i do i know if
*  it's not good because i don't like it so then i just do better just you don't want to like be
*  looking at the stats like oh you it's gonna fuck you up that's really good that's a good piece of
*  advice yeah just do it you're doing great you're great at this you're a natural oh thanks i will
*  say that i'm having the fucking time of my life there you go perfect i'm having so much fun doing
*  it that alone will make it great yeah i i thought it was something that i like it was a natural
*  offshoot from the two memoirs i wrote and then i built a one-man show off of it which is really
*  a way of me doing stand-up without calling it stand-up really you know and i toured did a lot
*  touring and it was fun and i loved it and i was thinking what's the next iteration of it what was
*  the subject of the one-man show it was called stories i only tell my friends live which is the
*  title of my first book but it was me talking about my life that was it and and by the oscar
*  thing that we talked about is a bit that's the big closer that's the big closer every do you play it
*  for people i play i play it for people and and i go into it just it becomes a very long shaggy dog
*  story and people love it and then i do questions and and and i realized that you know there are a
*  lot of actors there are a lot of actors that are better than me and you try to find out what your
*  special sauce is like what what why what is it that that i think maybe i can do that maybe others
*  can't and i think between the books and the one-man show and the podcast i think that there's
*  something about sharing my my experience in and and then bringing other people into it that people
*  have responded to in in now three different mediums that's then you've got it being yourself
*  and just being able to express your own unique perspective on life is what's interesting to
*  people you know like if you can honestly express so like when people listen to you particularly if
*  they listen to you over and over and over again for long periods of time they know if you're full of
*  shit or if you're just being yourself and if you're just being yourself they can kind of relax with
*  you they can get into you they can and then you tell them about things that you're interested in
*  and tells them tell them about things that stimulated you or made you curious or affected you
*  and inspired you you know springsteen says a great thing he says the audience expects two things of
*  you they expect you to make them feel at home at the same time you're surprising them dude let's
*  end with that that's perfect rob low i appreciate the fuck out this was great thank you very much
*  thank you so much i really enjoyed this man i really enjoyed it tell people the name of your
*  podcast how to get it it's called literally with rob low and you can get it on apple or sticher
*  or spotify or anywhere you get your podcasts that was really fun thank you very much thank you
*  goodbye people
