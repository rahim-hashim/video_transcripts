# Joe Rogan Experience #1416 - Rob Kearney
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74TaVlSuipo)
*  Two, you are the first ever person with a Mohawk on this podcast.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  Right? Is that accurate?
*  Yeah.
*  Just say yes.
*  Make me feel good.
*  Definitely the first with a purple and blue.
*  Oh, it's a full rainbow, man.
*  Oh yeah, that's right. All the way down the back.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Very, very nice.
*  Absolutely.
*  Very nice. Now, first of all, I love your fucking handle.
*  World's Strongest Gay.
*  That's me.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Is there in that community, is there acceptance?
*  Is there open?
*  Is it just about like they don't give a fuck just as long as you're a real powerlifter?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's yeah, when I came out, it was super cool.
*  Nobody really gave me any shit.
*  That's the best part about Strongman.
*  You know, I know you had Rob Oberst in here not too long ago and he even mentioned,
*  yeah, he's something, but I love him.
*  You know, he mentioned just like the community of Strongman is so
*  awesome because like we all realize what we have to do to get to this level of sport.
*  We all have to be a little bit of, you know, sick and twisted in the head to
*  look at a truck and get excited to pull it.
*  So yeah, when I came out, like nobody really gave a shit.
*  They were just like, all right, as long as you can still lift weights, we don't care.
*  Yeah, that's it mirrors the comedy community in that way.
*  For sure.
*  Like stand up comedy community.
*  Nobody gives a shit.
*  No, as long as you're funny and you're doing your job, like that's all that really matters.
*  And we know some that are in the closet and we're like, come on, man, just no one cares.
*  Come out.
*  No, no one gives a shit.
*  It'll probably be funnier.
*  Right.
*  More subject matter.
*  For sure.
*  You know, not holding onto as much.
*  It's easier to talk.
*  Like, you know, when I came out, just like, you know, the, you know, weight off my shoulders
*  was, uh, was unbelievable.
*  How long ago was this?
*  Uh, that was 2014.
*  So I was 22 years old.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So I was a late bloomer in the gay world.
*  Was it like when you were in high school and like, first of all, when, when do you know?
*  You know, I don't know that I have, like, I don't remember, like I never had like an
*  aha moment per se.
*  For me, it was going through high school.
*  Like I was involved in a bunch of stuff.
*  You know, it was a cheerleader actually also played football, um, was doing the weight
*  lifting thing, like it was class president.
*  So I had my hands in a bunch of different pots.
*  College super into everything as well.
*  Um, and really just focused on school and actually dated a girl for like a year and
*  a half in college in college.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, did you ever date a boy?
*  No.
*  So, but did you like, Oh, damn, I wish she was a boy.
*  She's cool.
*  It was, yeah, pretty much, you know, it was, uh, it was, it was more like a friendship
*  than a relationship, I guess, you know, like we were cool and everything and everything's
*  going well, but like, nothing else was really going on.
*  When you came out, was she like, aha.
*  Uh, that was, that was the reason I broke up with her.
*  Oh, you came out because, you know, meanwhile, you know, I'm dating this girl, but I'm watching
*  gay porn when she's not around.
*  I'm like, ah, this isn't right.
*  There's something else going on here.
*  So did you like, was it gay porn?
*  Like finding gay porn?
*  We're like, that's what I like.
*  Pretty much.
*  Really?
*  Gay porn is thought of very differently than straight porn because like straight porn,
*  here's the rub in the straight community.
*  You look at straight porn, you're like, ah, especially someone like me who has daughters,
*  you know, somebody probably did something awful to those girls when they were young.
*  Like that's like nine out of 10 times.
*  And that's why they turned to porn.
*  But when you see gay porn, it's like a couple of dudes would like to fuck.
*  Pretty much.
*  It's like even like I had Dan Savage on and he, you know, we were talking about gay porn.
*  He's like, it's like they don't think of it the same way.
*  No, not at all.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. So I ended up breaking up with that girl and I told her, I was like, yeah, like I think
*  I'm gay and I need to like figure this shit out.
*  You know, I'm 22.
*  I want to at least enjoy my twenties, you know, trying to figure out if I like dudes or not.
*  Was she like, damn, I turned Rob gay.
*  She was not very nice about it.
*  Was she?
*  Oh, did she freak out?
*  Yeah, it didn't.
*  It went downhill pretty quickly.
*  Whoa, really?
*  So, oh yeah.
*  Like we were living together at the time because we were in college.
*  So like, um, like kind of living together and then like I got kicked out and was like
*  living in my car for a little while.
*  So it was, yeah, kind of a shit show.
*  Wow.
*  She kicked you out.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Bitch.
*  Did you stay in contact with her?
*  No, not even a little bit.
*  Wow.
*  No, yeah.
*  Then like, you know, like six months later, she's like blowing up my phone saying I gave
*  her chlamydia.
*  I was like, oh, that's not on me.
*  Six months.
*  Not on me.
*  That's it.
*  It's been longer than that too, since we were doing anything.
*  So, oh, that's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think you keep chlamydia in your system dormant, right?
*  I wouldn't know.
*  You get it.
*  I would get it.
*  I think so.
*  I've dodged that bullet luckily, but that seems like one that I think you just get it
*  and then it's bad.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't seem too pleasant.
*  I mean, I don't think it.
*  And that was awkward too, because like all those like calls and everything were coming
*  through when I was with my now husband, Joey.
*  So like we were dating at that time and now my ex girlfriend is blowing up my phone saying
*  I gave her the clap.
*  But was he laughing?
*  At first, he was like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Because like we literally had been dating for two months.
*  So it was like super new.
*  So he's like, what the fuck did I get myself into?
*  Right.
*  Because you were a noob to the whole totally.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's crazy.
*  So you become you decide, okay, I got to deal with reality.
*  I'm gay.
*  You meet that one guy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you're still with them.
*  Still married.
*  Yeah.
*  With them.
*  We just got married this past March.
*  That's been a year.
*  That's kind of crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you didn't even play the field.
*  No, no, I got real.
*  You know, it's funny.
*  Like I joke about this all the time because like we met in like the typical millennial
*  gay way on Grindr.
*  And you know, I was, I wasn't even out actually before we met.
*  So like on Grindr, I was like that shirtless torso pick because I was still, you know,
*  Good move.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously.
*  And he was, no, they're not that good, but he thought they were.
*  So we, he like, you know, saw me pop up in the area.
*  It's like, oh, who's this bitch messaged me.
*  And I thought he was catfishing me because I thought he was way too hot for me.
*  Thought he was out of my league.
*  So I kind of just like got really lucky with the first guy that came my way.
*  That's, that's kind of be weird for her, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine being a girl with a guy and you're like, man, something is wrong with our relationship.
*  I mean, it's literally like the most like, like it's, there's no more other, like it's me,
*  it's you or no, it's not you.
*  It's me.
*  Right.
*  No, that is the, it's not you.
*  I don't think there's anywhere to go, you know, higher than that.
*  Like, well, unless you want to go pray the gay away.
*  That doesn't work.
*  No.
*  But is it, that is like a way that some people try to fix it.
*  Yeah.
*  Particularly like uber religious folks.
*  Yeah.
*  It is hilarious, man.
*  I think it's fricking funny.
*  I mean, you know, like, and I, I get shit a lot of, I mean, obviously like with an Instagram
*  handle world strongest gay, I get more shit on a daily basis on social media than I can even count.
*  And most of it's from like religious people.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like they're sending me like Bible, Bible verses.
*  Oh, telling me like I need to convert to Christianity and
*  by the way, they're probably jerking off while they're doing probably thinking about you.
*  I go, you need, you need to stop it.
*  You need to stop being so gay and delicious.
*  My, my go-to response is, you know, Hey man, I don't read fiction.
*  So you keep doing that.
*  But I just always think it's funny because, you know, they're like, you know, gay, like,
*  obviously I'm very open about my sexuality on social media and you know, world strongest man
*  has been super supportive of it.
*  They had world strongest man in June during pride month this year and did a whole lot of
*  expose about me, which was awesome.
*  And the comments on the world's strongest man, they're like,
*  you're pushing the gay agenda, like all this bullshit.
*  And I'm like, listen, man, like the only agenda we're pushing is like,
*  I just want to be treated like everybody else and like, get the same shit that you do.
*  You know, I've never once like tried to make someone gay,
*  you know, like meanwhile, Christians are in my DM saying like, you need to convert.
*  I'm like, Hey, you need to suck a dick.
*  That's the gay agenda is a hilarious phrase.
*  There's an agenda.
*  I still don't even know what it is.
*  So whoever's listening, if you could like hit me up and let me know,
*  I'd love to learn about it.
*  Yeah. You need to get in a tighter knit club.
*  I guess I do.
*  The gay agenda.
*  Yes. The rainbow Mohawk doesn't make me that gay.
*  But what a hilarious thing that like you're going to, it's not like you're trying to get
*  someone to be a Mormon.
*  No, you're the gay or not gay.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah. Why? But why does someone think that's like, that's the weirdest kind of homophobia to me.
*  Like I had a bit in one of my specials in the past.
*  Like there's two types of people that are afraid of gay marriage is people that are really dumb
*  or they're secretly worried that dicks are delicious.
*  And I share that all the time on my social media.
*  Just thinking about it.
*  I think it's fucking amazing.
*  But that's what it is.
*  Like worried about the gay agenda.
*  Like they're going to come get me.
*  No, get me to suck those delicious dicks.
*  That's what it's like.
*  It's like they're afraid.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  I think it's hysterical.
*  It is hysterical.
*  But.
*  Well, I was real lucky when I was a kid.
*  I was exposed to gay people real young.
*  When I was seven years old, we moved to San Francisco.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  In the 1970s.
*  It was gay as fuck.
*  And so I was around them all the time.
*  Like my next door neighbor was this gay couple.
*  My aunt used to go next door and they would get naked, smoke pot and play bongos together.
*  Sick.
*  Yeah.
*  It was pretty crazy.
*  So for me, that was normal life.
*  I was just like gay.
*  I was around gay people.
*  I didn't even hear the term faggot until I was 11 and we moved to Florida.
*  I remember hearing that when I was like, oh, wow.
*  Like I had my friend.
*  His name was Candy Candido.
*  He's a Cuban kid and his dad was real mad because gay people getting married.
*  He's reading this new paper.
*  Fucking believe the shit.
*  He throws his new paper down and he was a grown man.
*  I remember being 11 goes, why does he give a shit?
*  Like how weird literally doesn't affect him at all.
*  But he was so upset.
*  But it was important for me to see because I didn't know people like that.
*  So to be around my friend's dad and see him freak out like that, I was like, oh,
*  what a weird thing to waste your time thinking about.
*  For sure.
*  I mean, that's and you were super lucky to have that kind of upbringing.
*  You don't see that ugly part of the world.
*  Because I mean, the thing is with me, I'm fortunate enough where like not many people
*  talk shit to me in person.
*  I'm an average size strong man.
*  I'm not really that big of a dude.
*  What's the average size trauma?
*  You like 300 pounds.
*  And I'm the smallest guy that can eat.
*  How much do you weigh?
*  I'm like 285 right now.
*  That's not average size, bro.
*  Well, I mean, I just competed this weekend against Brian Shaw, the motherfuckers 420.
*  Yeah, that's you know, and six foot eight.
*  I'm five, 10, like, hey, man, cool.
*  You know, so like I'm fortunate, like most people don't talk shit to me person.
*  It's like on social media, but it did happen one time in Texas of all places.
*  I just finished a truck pull event.
*  This guy was like, call me a faggot from the stands, like all this stuff.
*  And like, I just looked and I was like, dude, I suck dick and I'm stronger than you.
*  And the whole crowd just kind of like went quiet and then he walked away.
*  They just went quiet.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I think like in that situation, like I feel like people feel like they're invincible.
*  Like they feel like they have the power because they're in the crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  And like they don't expect like somebody like who's competing to like say something back to them.
*  Right.
*  But like, I'm not going to like take that shit.
*  It's amazing.
*  It's only when one guy though.
*  Yeah.
*  That shows you how the times are changing.
*  For sure.
*  No, and yeah, it's in, you know, luckily like, you know, I was dubbed like the unofficial fan
*  favorite at world's strongest man this year.
*  So it's really cool to see the support throughout the entire community.
*  How do you get dubbed the unofficial fan favorite?
*  Who?
*  I was getting like the loudest applause whenever my name got announced.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  So the announcer is just kind of recalling me the fan favorite.
*  That's cool.
*  I'm happy with the way things are going with.
*  Totally.
*  It's changing, right?
*  It's getting a lot better.
*  You know, we're super fortunate and that's kind of like when I came out, like I'm lucky
*  because I had this like, I really don't give a fuck mentality when I came out.
*  I didn't care what people thought.
*  I didn't care who thought, you know, if they didn't like me, they didn't like me.
*  I'll just cut them out.
*  You know, fortunately, I didn't have to do that.
*  How did that transpire?
*  Was it because the weight of it was so it was, it gave me so much relief
*  that you felt like who gives a shit now?
*  Now I'm free.
*  Was it like that?
*  There was a lot that went into it.
*  So I like in my mind, I didn't like want to come out until like,
*  it seems dumb now, like until I knew I was really gay.
*  And I guess, you know, dating my now husband for six weeks, that was kind of the tipping point.
*  And at that point in our relationship, we kind of realized like, all right,
*  this wasn't just going to be like a fling and just having fun.
*  Like we were actually, you know, taking the steps to kind of be committed
*  and see what was going to happen here.
*  Not expecting marriage, but so I came out mainly because of him,
*  because he had he had been out since he was 17.
*  And at this point, we were 22.
*  And I didn't feel like it was fair for him to be in a relationship
*  with somebody that was still in the closet.
*  And that was like my biggest motivator for it.
*  And once you so you so you were already happy.
*  So you're in this happy relationship.
*  So if people were upset at you, you're like, I don't give a fuck.
*  I have what I want.
*  I'm in a better place.
*  Yeah.
*  And you also I mean, it must be I'm putting words in your mouth,
*  but it must feel like when you do become out or you do come out,
*  it must feel like not just a relief, but like you're you've solidified.
*  You're fine.
*  You're free.
*  You're you.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's exhausting, like waking up every day pretending to be somebody or not.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like you literally have to act different than you want to.
*  Did you have to talk about girls to guys?
*  Like when you're on?
*  Yeah.
*  Look at her ass.
*  Boy, I was always just like the funny thing is like after I came out,
*  like nobody was surprised.
*  So I feel like I was a guy that was just kind of like in the back around,
*  like awkwardly laughing when guys were talking about girls.
*  I'm like, oh, yeah, totally.
*  But I'm looking at the guys and bulges later, you know, right behind us.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Do you remember a year like when you were young, when you were like,
*  hey, something might be different.
*  You know, I think like I think back to like middle school.
*  And, you know, I think it's just like the stereotypical, like I was into theater,
*  I was into music.
*  I played sports, but wasn't really that good at them.
*  And actually was a cheerleader in middle school, too.
*  Like I was I did I joined my first cheerleading team in seventh grade.
*  And, you know, the funny thing is, is, you know, there was tryouts and everything.
*  And I got the fourth highest score out of all the girls.
*  So I figured that was, you know, a little telltale sign.
*  That was a sign.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Not stereotyping male cheerleaders whatsoever.
*  But I have a buddy who's a male cheerleader who's awesome.
*  He's Chappelle's 99.9% sure he's straight.
*  Chappelle Lacey.
*  But he's built like a brick shed house, too.
*  There I mean, collegiate cheerleaders are insane.
*  Yeah, but you have to be able to flip through the air.
*  People don't understand what cheerleading is, right?
*  They think of it as like, yeah, go team.
*  No, it's crazy acrobatics.
*  Even in high school, like I was throwing girls up in the air by myself and catching them overhead.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like doing shit like that.
*  Yeah, that's what's weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Chappelle does this stuff where he grabs them by the feet and flips them in the air.
*  Yeah.
*  Catches them on one hand.
*  It's stupid.
*  It's bananas.
*  Like the amount of physical power you have to have to be able to do that timing coordination.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  I mean, you have to be a fucking savage to throw someone in the air and catch them with one hand.
*  It takes a lot of balls.
*  A lot of fucking power to the explosive power.
*  Most men shitting on cheerleaders could never pull that off.
*  No, no, it's fucking hard.
*  Can you do all the flips and shit to back handsprings?
*  No.
*  Could you do it back then?
*  No, no, no, that's that's actually one of the reasons why.
*  Like, so I when I was doing it in high school, like actually looked to do it in college at the collegiate level.
*  But tumbling was like a minimum requirement and I was like, yeah, I'm a little too chunky.
*  I could do that shit.
*  So how did you get into powerlifting and strongman?
*  So that like honestly, totally by chance.
*  I was working out in my high school weight room one day after school
*  and a substitute teacher happened to walk by who owned a CrossFit gym.
*  And he was like, hey, you know, I'm at this CrossFit gym.
*  Like, you seem like you like this stuff and you're pretty strong.
*  Like, feel free to come by.
*  So I would start I actually started training with him at like five o'clock in the morning before school.
*  But then I found out really quickly I sucked at CrossFit, but I liked lifting heavy shit.
*  And this was back in 2009 and walked into the gym one morning and they were like, hey,
*  there's a local strongman contest this Saturday.
*  We signed you up for it.
*  So when you say you sucked at CrossFit CrossFit is just a bunch of Olympic lifts
*  and different explosive exercise.
*  Yeah, it just wasn't in shape.
*  Oh, right.
*  So the ability to do mass to do well in the workouts.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Right.
*  So, yeah, so they signed me up for my first contest.
*  I was 17 years old.
*  Had never touched an implement.
*  I had just seen it on TV like everybody else in World's Strongest Man.
*  Got my ass kicked.
*  Took last place.
*  But you were 17 and how much lifting had you done previous to that?
*  Maybe four or five months.
*  Really?
*  But at that point, like I had hit the 500 pound deadlift.
*  And you'd only been lifting for a couple of months.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so you just freak genetically.
*  In a few lifts.
*  In a few lifts I was good at.
*  That's a lot of weight to like for a few months of lifting.
*  Yeah.
*  So the contest went horrible for me, but I absolutely like fell in love with the sport.
*  Ended up at Springfield College in Massachusetts and joined their powerlifting team.
*  And that's when I kind of got, you know, more of a background in lifting,
*  proper technique and all that stuff.
*  And then did another local Strongman contest where I met this guy, Matt Mills,
*  who owns a gym, Lightning Fitness in Connecticut, where I train now.
*  And he was like, yeah, you know, like I'm just starting to get all the Strongman equipment.
*  You should come down.
*  It's only about 30 minutes from your school.
*  So I would, I actually would go there every Saturday morning from when I was in college
*  to train Strongman.
*  And that's when I kind of started competing in the amateur circuit.
*  You know, and that's kind of led me on my trajectory to here.
*  So you're one of those rare people that actually lives in Connecticut.
*  I live in Massachusetts.
*  Ah, good for you.
*  Right over the border.
*  Good move.
*  Yeah.
*  Escape.
*  Go over there.
*  Work out real quick.
*  And then leave.
*  Yeah.
*  Connecticut is strange.
*  It's something.
*  It's a strange place.
*  It's a lost state.
*  Yeah.
*  So you get into powerlifting and then what was your exposure to like truck pulling and
*  all that other crazy shit?
*  So really not much.
*  You know, you know, the cool thing about Strongman is every contest is different that we do.
*  We know we never do a same, you know, I've done the sport for over 10 years now and
*  I've never done a contest where the events have been the same in that span of time.
*  Do you know what it's going to be before you sign up?
*  Typically.
*  So, you know, we get about a series of lifts.
*  Eight to 12 weeks notice depending on the contest.
*  So the gym that I was going to in Connecticut, they were just starting to acquire Strongman
*  equipment.
*  So it was pretty bare bones.
*  So like we had a steel log, you know, for the log clean and press, they had some Atlas
*  stones, some farmers handles, a yolk, and that's pretty much it.
*  And then over the years he would get more and more and more.
*  And now it's turned into this massive 15,000 square foot facility and the gym owner, we
*  call him an equipment whore because he buys some every time something new comes out, he
*  buys it.
*  So yeah, like my my exposure to the equipment in the beginning was pretty minimal.
*  But what I did to compensate for that is I just competed more.
*  So I would pretty much from Springfield, Massachusetts, I drew a five hour radius
*  from where I was and any contest there was in that radius, I would do.
*  So in my first like three years, I competed probably like almost 40 times.
*  Whoa.
*  How often are these things being held?
*  At the amateur level, pretty often there's usually you could find, you know, I would
*  say one or two, you know, per month in New England alone.
*  Really?
*  And then they're all over the country.
*  So, you know, I think the cool thing is, you know, like I was really, I said I took last
*  in my first contest and that went on for a while.
*  I took dead last in like my first eight shows that I did.
*  So like I wasn't good at this thing when I started.
*  Now, when did you start being successful?
*  20.
*  So I went to amateur nationals actually in the 200 pound weight class.
*  So I weighed in under 200 pounds in 2011.
*  That was my first time at the amateur national.
*  So I'd been doing it for about two years.
*  Surprised myself and ended up taking second place in that weight class.
*  Went back to the amateur nationals as a 231 and 212 and took second place there.
*  And then won the amateur national championship in 2013.
*  And that's where I beat, you know, where I won my pro card and kind of got to that next level.
*  But it's such a difficult thing to do that.
*  I would imagine doing it 40 times a year.
*  Like you're going to get injured.
*  Luckily I didn't.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, I'm fortunate where I'm so by trade and what I went to school for is
*  I'm an athletic trainer.
*  So sports medicine has kind of been my thing.
*  So, you know, I've been lucky enough to learn.
*  When I was training of when I need to back off, when I can push a little bit harder,
*  what needs to be taken care of and just try to be smart.
*  You know, I'm, you know, knock on wood.
*  You know, I've had one serious injury in the 10 years that I've been doing this.
*  What was that?
*  It was a summer of 2018.
*  I dropped 275 pound Atlas stone on my chest.
*  Oh, so fuck.
*  Tore my QL in my low back, broke three ribs.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Put me out of commission for a little while.
*  And, you know, how'd you drop it?
*  Where was it?
*  It was at a contest.
*  I was in second place by one point.
*  So it was the final event of the contest and I went to push the stone onto the.
*  So the thing is with me being only 5'10", with the Atlas stones, like the first box
*  you have to put the stone on is high.
*  You know, so this was 75 inches tall.
*  You know, and I'm only 5'10".
*  So that was literally like eyebrow height.
*  So I had to like press it up onto the box and I thought it was up there.
*  It wasn't secured.
*  It ended up rolling off, fell onto my chest.
*  Oh, fuck.
*  And, you know, naturally that was the first contest my mom had come seen in person
*  in like four years.
*  Oh, she was in the stands watching her baby get killed by a boulder.
*  Yep.
*  Perfect timing.
*  Damn, dude.
*  Yep.
*  So how long did it take you to recover from that?
*  Let's see.
*  That was that was in June or June or July of 2018.
*  And I didn't do my next contest until March of 2019.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It took me off for a while.
*  I could have only imagine.
*  275 pound fucking stone ball.
*  And that was the lightest one we had in the series.
*  Wow.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So just your background in understanding athletic science or exercise science
*  allows you to know when you're being silly and when you, you know,
*  you're not going to be a pussy, but you're not going to be dumb.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think that's where it's that's why I've been lucky, you know, and, you know,
*  kind of state injury free because even like to this day, like, you know, so my coach is,
*  um, you know, pretty well renowned strong man, Derek Poundstone, who, you know,
*  took second place at world's strongest man.
*  And he programmed some crazy shit for me.
*  But there are some days where I'm just like, yo, dude, this is not going to fly today.
*  When you have a light, like, what's a light day?
*  Um, you know, so like I train four days a week and I get like one, like I call them,
*  like my bro day.
*  It's like my bench back and arms day.
*  You know, no power men do that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's more just like, cause like bench press is going to like build up your triceps.
*  It's going to build up the anterior delt.
*  It's going to help like you bench press actually helps your overhead lifts.
*  And, um, so I do that and that's what I consider like my light day, but like I'll still bench,
*  like in the mid fours.
*  So, so four days a week.
*  Yeah.
*  And so how do you, how do you structure it?
*  Do you do every other day?
*  Do you do, um,
*  it all depends on the week really.
*  So typically I try to go Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday.
*  That's usually my, my average week.
*  Um, so Tuesday is like my big overhead day where I'll do a strongman movement overhead.
*  So like log press or dumbbell, um, and then a bunch of shoulder overhead accessory work
*  Thursday, my day two is my biggest day.
*  So I squat and deadlift in the same day.
*  And that's a workout that sometimes takes four to five hours.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So you do big spaces in between each workout.
*  So you lift and then do you, do you have like a large
*  I'll take about 10, 15 minutes between sets.
*  Sometimes like, you know, like we're building up to the Arnold strongman classic in Columbus,
*  Ohio this coming March.
*  And, um, you know, we have a max deadlift coming up and, you know, I'm potentially going
*  to be going for a 1000 pound deadlift.
*  And Christ, you know, so like to get through a deadlift workout where I'm deadlifting.
*  Oh yeah, there's me.
*  There's you look at the bar bending.
*  That's what's most fucked up about it is looking at that dude.
*  So that was, that was 850 pounds on the, on the, the deadlift right there.
*  What is that?
*  That dumbbell right there.
*  That dumbbell was two 50, two 50, one arm overhead press.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking a the, the deadlift though is so, what is that fucking thing?
*  That's called a Husser felt stone.
*  It's like a coffin.
*  Yep.
*  Pretty much that weighs four 50.
*  Wow.
*  Are you wearing a, like a back strap, like a belt?
*  So we're a belt.
*  Yeah.
*  So I wear like a, yeah.
*  So it helps like build intra abdominal pressure.
*  It also gives just like some tactile feedback to like know where you need to brace.
*  So usually weightlifters like, we'll put it where like we feel weakest in our core.
*  And that's going to help us activate those muscles to be a little bit stronger and,
*  you know, more effectively brace to prevent injury.
*  Cause I never, I never understood how it would protect you from a lift.
*  Like if you're lifting heavy weights and you got that strap around your back.
*  Yeah. It's not really tech.
*  It's I guess it's not really meant to like protect per se.
*  More just to like help add extra support.
*  That's the biggest thing.
*  So it does.
*  You don't do heavy lifts without.
*  No, no, no, I keep it on.
*  Yeah. Whenever I'm going heavy.
*  That's pretty much standard for power lifters.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Powerlifting strong man.
*  We're all wearing like pretty heavy duty belts.
*  Now, when you train, do you train to doing strong man stuff?
*  Like, do you pull trucks and shit like that in training?
*  Yeah. So leading up to world's strongest man, I knew we had a truck pull.
*  We actually got to pull the, the grave digger and the monster jam fire truck.
*  Really?
*  The, the monster trucks at worlds this year, which was pretty cool.
*  How much is the grave digger way?
*  Well, so the funny thing is it only weighs 15,000 pounds.
*  So they had to grab a second one and attach them.
*  So we were having two of them at one time.
*  How does one ever say it only weighs 15,000 pounds?
*  That's what I want to know.
*  Cause I suck at that event.
*  So I don't, you know, I would like it if it was only one of them, but.
*  That's, that's an event where it must help to be 450 pounds.
*  Huge, huge advantage.
*  You know, you look at guys like me, you know, again, only five, 10, about 285 competing
*  against in my qualifying group of worlds was Thor Bjornsson, the mountain from game of thrones.
*  Yeah. How much does that fucker weigh?
*  Six, nine, four 40.
*  Jeeze.
*  That bitch has a six pack.
*  Six, nine, four 40.
*  Yeah. So that's Thor doing the event right there.
*  And you can see grave digger right behind them.
*  And then behind that they attached with a metal pole to the monster jam.
*  Oh, so you use a rope to pull you as well.
*  Yeah. So it's like, kind of, you get a little bit of lever.
*  Yeah. There's a second truck.
*  Two trucks. That is ridiculous.
*  Yeah. So leading up to world strongest man, I actually became really good friends with
*  the firefighters in my local town.
*  And I just, I talked to the fire chief.
*  I was like, Hey, can I borrow one of your trucks to pull?
*  What do you do if a fire breaks out?
*  Hey, we've got our friend. He's out there pulling it.
*  They can wait. Yeah. His responses. Are you shitting me?
*  I was like, I'm actually serious.
*  So I actually, I was pulling that, I was pulling that fire truck like
*  once or twice a week for like six weeks leading up to world's strongest.
*  How much is a fire truck way?
*  Depends if the water's in it or not. I found that out the first time it wasn't.
*  So it was only about 28,000 pounds and it was actually only 28,000 casual.
*  That ain't shit.
*  The second time the water was in it. So it was 40,000.
*  Oh no.
*  That was a little bit harder and it made me look like an ass because like I had told my friends
*  that I was doing this this time thinking that it was the same truck and it was as light as it was
*  the first time I was like, all right, I'll look pretty cool in front of everybody.
*  And then I go to pull it. I'm like, this is heavier.
*  Yeah. That's a lot different. So it's an extra 12,000 fucking pounds.
*  Yeah. And so like I was training in a 50 foot course and like that 40,000 pound truck,
*  it was taking me like almost 90 seconds to pull. And that's like 90 seconds of just nonstop work.
*  Jesus Christ. What does that do to your knees?
*  The knees aren't too bad. Honestly, it's just like
*  full body like burning, like everything hurts.
*  Right.
*  Nothing. Feel like your arms are pumped because you're pulling on the rope in front of you.
*  Your quads and your calves are just pumped to the max at that point.
*  I'd be worried about like knees and ankles.
*  Am I wrong?
*  The biggest injury that you see with like a truck pull is like the Achilles tendon rupture.
*  Right.
*  So the Achilles tendon will just like pop off when you're trying to pull it.
*  That makes sense because you just pushing off with your foot and all that pressure. Oh, fucker.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn.
*  What a sport.
*  The sport's really great.
*  It's a sadistic sport. It's just so crazy to watch people pull two trucks.
*  Like a human being pulling two trucks. I wish I would see you with the fire truck. That's more
*  ridiculous. See you pulling a fucking fire truck.
*  It was pretty fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Sure, if you could do it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  If you do it, it's fun. That's a weird thing with people, right? They just love
*  to be able to do something that's hard to do.
*  And I think that's why like all of us are attracted like strongmen. That's why we compete.
*  Like I said in the beginning of the show, we all have to be a little bit fucked up in the
*  head to look at a truck and get excited to pull it.
*  Yeah. Look at that.
*  There it is.
*  That's so crazy. There you are. Pull the truck.
*  That's my coach behind it, Derek.
*  God damn. Have you ever seen the video of the strongman who throws the barrel up,
*  it hits the bar and falls back and hits him in the back of the head?
*  Dude.
*  That was on him.
*  Is that guy dead?
*  No, he lived.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  What kind of a human can survive that?
*  I don't know. I think it was an empty keg, if that makes it any better.
*  If it was, even if it was a fucking aluminum barrel bouncing off your skull.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Okay. I mean, he was knocked out cold for a little while.
*  Now, how old are you now?
*  I'm 28. Just turned 28 November.
*  Is there a lifespan for doing what you do? Cause I would imagine like you're putting
*  tremendous stress.
*  You know, I think like we see most of the guys are in their prime, like
*  mid thirties. I would say like early to mid thirties is kind of like the prime for most
*  strongman athletes. But then you got guys like Mark Felix from the UK who's 53 and he's still
*  competing and breaking world records.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, piss test that guy. He's on all the shit. 53.
*  53. He also, he has the biggest hands in strongman. So they actually don't fit on an 8 by 11 piece
*  of paper.
*  What?
*  Yeah. So his hands are like 11 and a half, 12 inches long.
*  Yeah.
*  That's ridiculous. That's like shack hands.
*  It's crazy. But that's why he, the world records that he gets are all in grip events.
*  Ironically. And then I have like, you know, the where's the meat hands and
*  can't hold on to anything.
*  God damn. 53.
*  It's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. And he looks like he's 38.
*  You got a picture of that guy, Jamie?
*  Yeah. I was trying to find him.
*  Got sidetracked by trying to find his hands in the middle there.
*  Wow. Look at him.
*  There's Mark.
*  Fucking a look at the size of his hands.
*  It's crazy.
*  They're so long.
*  Yeah.
*  That is incredible though that he's 53.
*  Look at it.
*  He's taking pictures of people.
*  Yeah. So at the contest that we do in the
*  thickness in his fingers, those are fucking
*  the sausages.
*  Yeah. The contest that we do in England through a company called giants live.
*  That's like one of their promo things that they do in the, in the, in the magazines that they give
*  everybody where they'll actually put a life, you know, a picture of his hand so everybody can compare
*  his hand to, to their own.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  It's stupid.
*  So big that, yeah, that would definitely help, man.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  You know, that's incredible though that he's still competing at such a high level at 50.
*  What is that injury?
*  He's right there. Look at his elbow.
*  What's going on?
*  I was probably a torn bicep.
*  Is that common?
*  Super common.
*  Yeah. Torn bicep, I would say is like arguably the most common injury in strongman.
*  And what is it? Which, which lifts usually cause that to blow out?
*  Usually you'll see that on a Atlas stone, a tire flip, or if you're deadlifting with like a mixed
*  grip with the underhand on the barbell, usually the bicep will pop off in the elbow and roll up
*  into the shoulder.
*  What are your thoughts about deadlifting on a mixed grip? Do you think that you should do that or
*  should you do it both?
*  It all depends. I mean, if you're using straps, like if you're using straps to aid in the grip
*  and kind of take the grip out, go double overhand.
*  Cause there's really no point to have a mixed grip and put you at risk of an injury when you
*  don't need to. The straps kind of take the grip out of the work for you.
*  But for powerlifting, that's not allowed. So they have to compete with them. They have to
*  deadlift without straps. So there's two options you can go with. You can go with the mixed grip
*  or hook grip, which hook grip is you wrap your hand around the bar and then put your fingers
*  over your thumbs. And it hurts like a motherfucker because their bar is just resting there on your
*  thumb and then pushing down on it. But it, you get a better grip and it, you know, kind of,
*  yeah, just like that.
*  That's weird. Why would that be easier?
*  I don't know, but it works. It's just, if you have a really good pain tolerance, it's the way to go
*  because then you're taking out that bicep from the equation and you won't have any risk of
*  injury with that.
*  That's interesting. And, but that does, that's not the case with like farmers carries or any
*  farmers walk or anything.
*  No. So with farmers, like the handles are usually a little bit too big to be able to get like a grip
*  like that. So it literally is just a straight up grip event. And I hate them.
*  Do you do a lot of training with like big, thick grip things? Like I know like rogue has those balls
*  that you can do chin ups with and shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Do you like fat grips? Like whenever I do like bicep curls, sometimes I'll put like
*  just fat grips onto the dumbbells. Just doing that just to work it. I do a lot of shrugs,
*  stuff like that. Whether it's with farmers handles or a frame or a barbell or dumbbells.
*  And if that's the case, I'll put like fat grips on there to try to work the grip as well.
*  That, so that dude is 53 years old and he's still competing at the top of the food chain.
*  When you, do you see yourself possibly doing that dude? That's 25 more fucking years for you.
*  I don't see me doing it for that long. I think my goal is to get to like 35 and kind of evaluate
*  where I am. I think if I can do this until I'm 35 at this level, that'd be a really good run.
*  Cause I did made my first world strongest man appearance when I was 25. So if I can go to
*  worlds 10 years, I'd be really happy with that. This is a, it's a crazy way to make a living.
*  It's a crazy way to spend your time and like to pursue your life. Do you, cause you're,
*  you're banking everything on your body hanging in there. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. What do you,
*  like what is, when one has a job that at 35, you're most likely probably going to be on your way
*  out the door. How do you structure your life? You know, for me, I'm fortunate, you know,
*  to have my master's degree in athletic training and sports medicine. So I keep that, you know,
*  valid and up to date. And I still do like per diem work all throughout, you know,
*  new England, just trying to keep my chops up on that whenever I have the free time to do so.
*  But I mean, per diem work, like you mean, so like I'll cover high, I'll cover like high school hockey
*  games or college games and just work as an athletic trainer, just pretty much for the day.
*  You know, just taking care of any injuries, stuff like that. You know, that's kind of my wheelhouse,
*  you know, taping concussion evaluation, all that stuff, injury rehab. Yeah. Now what kind of, like
*  I would imagine would, were you talking about these four hour deadlift squat days? I mean,
*  you must have some serious rehabilitation routine that you go through, right? Yeah. You know, I mean,
*  I do everything from like self massage and, you know, I have my own STEM unit at home and do that,
*  but then I'm also doing recovery workouts on my off days. So how much those STEM things help those
*  electrical stimulation? Do you, what, what, what one do you use? Compacts. Compact. Yeah. That's the
*  brand that I go with. So you have, it's like those glue things, the pads, little pads, you put them
*  on. And then the nice thing about the Compacts ones is like, they're pretty much foolproof. So like,
*  has like 12 to 15 pre-program settings. You put, you kind of like punch in what body part it's on
*  and then you just pick what setting you want it on. So it's like pain relief, training recovery,
*  competition recovery, muscle activation. There's a bunch of different ways to use it. And then you
*  just hit go and it goes. Oh, so you just, it's awesome. I mean, TV or something. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But I have it in my carry on. So when I fly home tonight, I'll put it on during my seven hour flight
*  home and use it. Someone sent me one years back, but I never fucking used it. Compacts. I'm gonna
*  write that down. Yeah. I think they're awesome. Yeah. So along with that, then I do, I do recovery
*  workouts. So like, I'll go to the, I'll go to like a commercial gym and you know, I'll swim, not well,
*  do hot tubs, sauna. And then I have like a massage therapist and body work person that I go and see.
*  I try to see every week, but sometimes it's every other week where they do deep tissue massage,
*  cupping, dry needling, the whole nine yards on me. Dude, you're so dense. You must have a fucking
*  seriously powerful massage therapist. If someone's going to go deep tissue works in pro hockey. So
*  in there, man, he's, he's no joke. That's the key, right? Is having someone who's really good at,
*  yeah, strong. And it took me in there. It took me a while to find this guy. And ironically, like him
*  and I ended up going, we were at college together and he was in the area and I was like, oh, you
*  know, like he's getting this massage degree. I know he's an athletic trainer and he has a really
*  good background of the body and injuries and stuff like that. Let me see how it works. And he lit me
*  up the first time. You can't just go to a regular spa and get a deep tissue massage. Oh no, I fall
*  asleep. You know what? Yeah, it feels great. It just took an hour. I just paid 90 bucks for a nap.
*  Thanks. It doesn't do enough, right? No, like, I mean, I tell people, like I'm usually more sore
*  when I leave a massage than when I go in, but then the next day I feel great. Yeah. Breaks everything
*  loose. Yeah. It seems weird that you can just manipulate injuries or tight spots into
*  pliability, but it does work. Well, and that's the thing that's like, um, I've been huge into the dry
*  needling lately and I think it's awesome. So it's pretty much like acupuncture with science behind
*  it. So now dry needling is they take these needles and they just sort of shove it into the muscle.
*  Yeah. Wherever there's like a trigger point or tightness or restriction, they'll go in. Um,
*  and they don't just leave it there. Like they'll move it around while it's in there. Um, and it's
*  not terribly uncomfortable unless there's like a spot that's really fucked up. Um, but it works
*  great. Like I had some low back pain that was killing me for a long time and it ended up being
*  cause of my so as, um, my hip flexors were super tight. He threw a couple of needles in my, in my
*  hip flexors. And by the time I got off that table, all of my back pain was gone. Have you ever used
*  one of those so right things? Oh yeah. Yeah. Those are great. Yeah. They're amazing. But I mean,
*  you know, they make you see Jesus. Yeah. They mean the design, whoever the sick fuck is that
*  created that as a genius design with the scoop. It fits perfectly. It's, it's comfortable to like
*  sorta. Yeah. It digs in there, but you can use that fucker on everything. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan
*  of that. I'm a big fan of those. Uh, you have a Kelly Star. It's mobility wad. Yeah. That ball,
*  those fuckers you lie on that. I got those scattered all over the gym out there. For sure.
*  And I use his, like the voodoo band, the flossing. I do that too, you know, cause with the stuff that
*  we do, you know, like my elbows get beat to shit, you know, if I'm doing heavy bench press and like,
*  even like the dumbbell that you saw earlier, like just having like 250 pounds cranked on your
*  shoulder like that, just puts a ton of strain in the elbows. Like my elbows get beat up pretty
*  good in that. I mean, using the voodoo band is huge for that. Well, so what that just, it constricts,
*  and then you do a little bit of an exercise with it and then you undo it. Yeah. And then I kind of
*  manipulate it a little bit too. So sometimes like if I have a spot in my elbow, that's really
*  killing me, I'll put a golf ball on it and then wrap the band around the golf ball. Yeah. Um,
*  and then I'll go through that range of motion and move my arm around. Um, yeah. So I'll do exercises
*  like that, but like I said, sometimes I'll throw like the golf ball in there. Uh, so it hurts like
*  a bitch, but it works great. Yeah. I'm a big fan of it for, I had a little bit of a tendonitis
*  issue in my shoulder or in my elbow rather that helped a lot. I think it's great elbow. Um,
*  people using like a patellar tendonitis on their knees. Uh, so like all stuff like that is,
*  and that's the thing, like with a lot of strong men in general, like a lot of us do like that body
*  work and like try to stay healthy because you have to, right? Well, at this level too, like the sport
*  has exploded in the past few years and like my competition season started this past weekend
*  and the last contest I'll do is in October. Oh my God. So it's 10 months long. And as of right now,
*  I have almost 13 contests planned. Now, when you have a contest, say if you do some crazy
*  strong man competition, how much time do you give yourself after it's over? Um, I mean, I'll be back
*  in the gym tomorrow when I get home. Really? I just competed on Saturday. Wow. Okay. Well, so
*  a couple of days off, two days off and then get right back right back into it. Yeah. Man. I mean,
*  that's, I mean, that's kind of a special consideration mainly because like the contest
*  I'm going into is seen as like the, the biggest contest in the world. So it's the Arnold strongman
*  classic in Ohio, only 10 men qualify for this contest. Um, yeah, yeah. So, and this is, this
*  will be my first year competing there. So my coach was just like, listen, like you can't waste any
*  time. We only have five weeks of training essentially to get ready for the show, even though
*  I've been prepping for it for the past, like, you know, six months, we used to do a UFC at the
*  Arnold. That is a crazy show like that. It's wild and it's gotten even bigger. And there's so many
*  people walking around in baggy sweatpants, so many dudes, baggy sweatpants, stringer, stringer, uh,
*  you know, stringer tank tops and then girls in nothing but spandex and sports bras. That whole
*  industry is so strange. Like the fitness influencer industry. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
*  that's what like, honestly, it took me so long to get a sponsorship one because I'm not huge and two
*  because I don't have a six pack. Like nobody wants to look at like a chubby pasty white dude on the
*  front of a, like a supplement sponsor. Right. I know you could be built like this guy and just
*  pick up heavy shit. Yeah. It was like, oh cool. They don't care if you're powerful. They want,
*  you know, like look like you're dehydrated. That's all. Yeah. That's what I care about.
*  What looks good on a poster? Yeah. Are you starving and dehydrated with some spray tan?
*  We want you. We want you. That's what we're looking to be jacked and tan. Yeah. And that was, uh,
*  yeah. So that, yeah, that was one of the things that, why it took me like so long to get in with
*  some companies and like actually get a legit sponsorship. Is there anybody? Well, that guy
*  Bjornson, however the fuck you say his name is, the Thor guy, he's got a six pack.
*  Close to it. Yeah. Is that just preposterous genetics? It's stupid. Yeah. Well, obviously
*  the size of him is just preposterous. That's that is Viking, right? That is straight. And his name
*  is Thor. Yeah. Come on. Come on. That's, that's the generation after generation of marauders.
*  Yeah. I mean, his dad is also like six, eight. It's crazy. Yeah. Only makes sense. So what is
*  like when, what is the difference between someone that is that big that can stay lean? Like why,
*  why can he stay lean? Um, I think it's just like, I want to think it's like the quality
*  food that he eats, you know, like with him being arguably the strongest man in the world, you know,
*  he didn't win world's strongest man this year, but he's been dominant over the past two years.
*  You know, beat him. Martins, Lisa's from the U S he's actually right here in LA. Is he? Yeah.
*  Yeah. He, he just won back in, uh, back in June. He's from the UK. Is that what you're saying? You,
*  said you, Oh, U S U S originally from Latvia. Um, and now he's lived in the U S I mean, for
*  as long as I can remember, how big is that? He's six. There's Martins and me. So he's about like
*  six, three, about three 50. So he beat Thor. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. He beat a guy that's 150 pounds
*  heavier than him. Yeah. That's crazy. I mean, that's the thing about the sport, you know, like I,
*  so the way I qualified for the contest in Ohio, the size of that fucker. Yeah. So the way I,
*  the way I qualified for this, uh, the contest in Ohio was, um, by winning the Arnold in Australia.
*  And, you know, I know, like I said, I'm, I'm the smallest guy that does this at this level.
*  And I was beaten guys, you know, like, um, Jerry Pritchett, who's like six, six, three 70, you know,
*  like I, you know, so how do you, how are you that strong? What is the difference? Stubborn
*  bitch, Joe. Is that what it is? Um, you know, I think with me, it's like, it took me a really
*  long time. Yeah. There's Thor and Martins. What a size of that fucker. God damn. And I've the,
*  the woman on Thor's right is our, our left is his wife. Yeah. I've seen the two of them together.
*  She's five too. Hilarious. They're going to make a regular sized kid.
*  Yeah. But yeah, you know, I think, uh, I think I got to this level because like, I was a student of
*  the sport for a really long time and I like studied everything. And I think it, because
*  you know, I took so long to get to where I am, you know, most guys that are at this level,
*  it didn't take them 10 years to get there. You know, like guys like Brian Shaw, like Martins,
*  like they pretty much got to worlds within two or three years. This is giant powerful people.
*  Figure out the work. Um, and for me, it was like, I needed to learn how to make these events work
*  for my body, you know? So like that's with me, you know, like, so I have the current American
*  log press record and I don't do like a typical push press. I actually split jerk underneath the
*  log. Um, and I'm the only pro strongman at this level that does that. Why do you do that? It's
*  more efficient. Why don't they do it? It's an athletic quick movement and it's, it takes a lot
*  of time and coordination to learn with me having a background in CrossFit. That's where I learned
*  the split jerk technique. And then when I got more into strongman, I was like, well, I really suck
*  at strict pressing. We explained that to people with the differences. So like a push press is
*  pretty much, you get the weight on your shoulders, you dip down and then just push the weight up
*  overhead. Like pretty much just with like shoulder and tricep power with a split jerk.
*  Yeah, we get you, you get the implement on your shoulders, you do a little dip and then you
*  actually throw yourself underneath the log while splitting your feet. Um, so it's like a little bit
*  of a dance almost. So this is 455 pounds. So you get it up to your chest and then you'll see me,
*  I dip and then drop underneath it. Oh wow. Splitting my feet and then catching overhead.
*  So what it does, it shortens the range of motion of the press. Um, but it's, it's kind of one of
*  those like risky all or nothing moves. Like with a push press, it's brute strength. So you can like
*  kind of grind through it and fight it and manipulate the log any way you want. But with a split jerk,
*  like it has to happen or it doesn't. There's gotta be that weird moment where you're like,
*  fuck, this isn't happening. I gotta drop this thing. Yep. What is that like? Throw it, just get it away.
*  Hold in 450 fucking pounds over my head. I'm not taking it. I don't care what breaks as long as
*  it's not me. Especially after that Atlas stone dropped on you, right? Yeah. You know, it's just,
*  for me it was, it was, uh, you know, adapting that split your technique. It just, it just made sense.
*  And that's, um, that's kind of how I was able to progress to the sport, to this level and
*  kind of do some things. A lot of people didn't think I would do being this size.
*  Now, how much do you eat? You must be eating. I ate a good amount all the time. It's, it's not
*  a crazy amount. No. I mean, I say that like, you know, cause I think like you also said,
*  oh, it's only 28,000 pounds. Um, I think like people get caught up in like these 10,000
*  calorie eating challenge. They're like Oberst did and Brian Shaw and stuff like that. I'm not that
*  guy. You know, like an average eating day for me is probably around four to 5,000 calories.
*  So it's a lot, but nothing crazy. Well, Oberst is so big, huge. He's a giant. Exactly. You know,
*  like he was sitting in this chair, like I'm a little different looking than him. He's got double
*  your head. His head is so wide. You're like, what are you? Yeah. He looks like an ogre. He's,
*  he's the real life Shrek. He's a great guy. He's awesome. I love him. You know, is that
*  fucker huge? They, uh, so the first conversation Rob and I ever had was actually at that contest
*  in Texas when a dude was calling me a fag from the stands and we were hanging out before the con,
*  the day before the contest, we had never met in person before. First interaction we have,
*  we're hanging out in a hotel room, a few of us athletes. And he looks at me, he's like,
*  how old were you when you knew you wanted a dick in your mouth?
*  That's the first thing he said to you. First thing he ever said to me. What'd you answer?
*  I didn't know. I didn't know what to respond. Like I, this is the guy I had seen on world's
*  strongest man before. Like I've seen him, I've seen him competing for the past like three or
*  four years. And that's the first thing the motherfucker says to me. Um, yeah. So obviously
*  like we got off to a great start on our friendship, you know, and like him and I still talk all the
*  time and you know, he's better because I took the, the log press record from him back in April.
*  Yeah. He's very upset with that. He had that. It was his, it was his for a while, like for four years.
*  Poor Robert. No, no, you win some and you lose some. That's what competition's all about.
*  Records are meant to be broken, you know? Now what is your typical breakfast for you like?
*  And how, how many times do you eat in a day? Um, I try to go between six and eight meals.
*  Oh, so it all depends on like when my training is and stuff like that. Should you bring like
*  little Tupperware containers with you and shit and everything prepped out?
*  And to be honest, I'm pretty boring. Like I don't like to cook. I love to eat, but I don't like to
*  cook. So I'll pretty much eat the same thing almost every meal. Um, you know, so it's pretty
*  much like chicken or beef and rice and veggies. Pretty much it. That's what Robert was saying.
*  Basically everybody's like rice and meat. Yeah. You know, it's, um, you know, like I'm a fat kid.
*  So like, I don't like to just eat baked chicken. Like that's why I'm not a bodybuilder. Like I'm,
*  I can't look like that because I just like the taste of food too much. So like, I do like
*  air fried chicken fingers to make them healthy, you know, like that'll be the chicken that I eat,
*  you know? And then I'll throw some sauce on top of it, you know, make the chicken fingers.
*  Like do you, do you bread them and everything? Yeah. Yeah. What do you use for the breading
*  and everything? Uh, usually I'll do like panko, um, and throw that was like panko breadcrumbs.
*  So it's just like a little bit like a more coarse, bigger, um, you know, a little more
*  crispier, which is nice too. Cause the texture is like, I don't want it to taste just like mush
*  when I'm eating it. Like I like a crunch, a little texture, but in the, in the breadcrumbs,
*  I'll just use plain panko, but I'll, I'll add like a, like ranch seasoning packet to throw some
*  flavor in there, get a little crazy, um, do like an egg wash, bread them and then throw them in the
*  air fryer. So you don't have to worry about how much you take in. So you're basically just eating
*  whatever you want to eat. And the reason why you eat so many meals a day is just because you're
*  burning off so much. Yeah. Yeah. And like, I honestly, I just get hungry. Right. Like,
*  I'm sure you're powerlifting all the time. Yeah. You know, like I said, you like my deadlift workout
*  will take four to five hours, but like there's sometimes on the weekends when I'm doing my strong
*  man workouts, I'll be at the gym for like six to eight hours. Oh yeah. Six to eight hours of
*  lifting ridiculously heavy shit. Yeah. I mean, granted, like a lot of the stuff we do is like
*  setting up and breaking down, right? You know, like see the vent, these events are cumbersome.
*  They're annoying. They're not easy to set up. Um, so a lot of it's like just moving weight,
*  schlepping across the gym and, you know, setting these implements up, but all in all, yeah,
*  I'll be there for like six to eight hours from the time I get there to when I leave. I would imagine
*  you would need a lot of sugars. Oh yeah. Like my, the shake I drink during my workout is almost a
*  thousand calories. What's in it? Well, like Gatorade protein, I use a carb powder. You put Gatorade in
*  a shake and then carb powder on top of the Gatorade. Listen, it tastes like an orange
*  creamsicle. So you do like orange Gatorade, like a, um, orange or a non-flavored carb powder
*  and then vanilla protein. And just that's a thousand calories. Yeah. I mean, it's also like
*  64 ounces. Oh, okay. So it's pretty big. So it's gotta be this balancing act between getting a lot
*  of protein, but getting a lot of carbohydrates and making sure that you're carbs are the best
*  thing ever. Yeah. Like carbs, that's like the, the, the main thing, you know, obviously eating a lot
*  of protein, like I'm probably around like 300 grams of protein a day, between three and 350.
*  But carbs, I mean, there are some times I'm eating like almost like 1500 grams of carbs a day.
*  And is the reason why you guys prefer rice is just cause it's easier to digest. There's other forms.
*  Yeah. It's just easy to eat too. Um, you know, like, cause eating six to eight times is a lot
*  and like, you just get tired of chewing, right? To be honest, you know, like great for the job.
*  No, for sure. Sculpted chin look, um, you know, and you know, that's why I like my coach,
*  when he was competing, he used to do a chicken shakes. Why it's chicken. So he would, he would
*  literally like boil chicken and blend it with water. Oh yeah. That's nasty. And he would drink
*  those because he just didn't want to eat. Hold it together, but chicken shake, a chicken shake.
*  Why does that sound so gross? I couldn't even, I looked at him. I was like, you're fucking make
*  me do that. I'm kicking you in the face. So are you eating a lot of red meat? Like, uh, what kind of,
*  what's your preferred protein? I love bison bison bison is like my jam. Um, just ground bison,
*  try to go like 93, seven if I can, um, super lean. Um, yeah, but all depends. Like, you know,
*  obviously as a pro strong man, I'm not making that much money. So, you know,
*  more of them more often than not, it's just like ground beef, whatever I can get. That's good
*  quality and it gets the calories in. Yeah. Bison has got a higher protein content, right? Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's a little bit leaner. Um, and I just, it like, just tastes so much better. Yeah. You get
*  that grass fed bison. Yeah. Farm raised grass. So how, how does a strong man make money? Do you only
*  make money if you win or do you make money from sponsors? Like what's your primary income coming
*  from? So my main income is, um, is mainly from sponsorships, you know, so I'm sponsored by a
*  supplement company, Blackstone labs, um, SPD, which is a, like an equipment company. They make like
*  knee sleeves, belts, elbow sleeves, stuff like that. And then a, a clothing company that's called
*  kind of fit kind of fat. So, yeah, it's honest. It's great. It's a lifestyle kind of fit kind of
*  fat. Yeah. Um, so they, those are like my three biggest supporters. And, um, and then on top of
*  that, I also do like online coaching for, for strength athletes all over the world. So, you know,
*  pretty much I write their weekly workouts. They send me videos, I collaborate with them, get them
*  competition prep and get them ready to compete. Um, so those are my two biggest main sources of
*  income. And then, you know, on top of that, and then, you know, prize money is just kind of
*  extra on top, you know, bonus essentially. Now you're active on social media. Obviously you have,
*  uh, Instagram, which is where I found you, but you, do you have anything else you do? Do you do
*  YouTube? Do you do, do you do a podcast or anything? Um, do YouTube. Yeah. So same YouTube name world
*  strong as gay. Um, you know, and then, um, just launched a website a couple of weeks ago. Um,
*  so a lot of content is going to be up there. Uh, Rob Kearney strong man.com. And then, um,
*  do you own world strong as gay.com? I don't. Who does? I don't, nobody does actually. What?
*  That's nonsense. Yeah. Well, listen, this isn't live. So let's true. Snatch that shit up. Get
*  that right after the show immediately. Yeah. Go to world strong as gay.com. Do you want to double
*  that S cause that's could make it interesting world worlds or world strong. You know what I mean?
*  Typing that double S and the type in the double S it's double S. Yeah. It's the world's strongest
*  gay. Let me see that double S. That might not exist. Cause we're going to, we're going to get
*  that. We're going to give you that. We're going to buy it right now and give it to you. This is
*  important because otherwise some Dick is going to get it. And then, yeah, they're going to,
*  Oh, you can pay on it. That's what he's going to be fucked up. That would be fucked up. All just
*  vaginas. 10 bucks. You can get it. Snatch it up. Well, we can let him get it. It's harder to
*  transfer. Oh, okay. Perfect. Luckily we're not live. So as soon as we're done, we'll let you do
*  that. Yeah. You got to own that man and just have it divert right to your website. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. What? What? One second. What? It added the HTTP in there. Let me double
*  check. Oh, Jesus Christ. Don't. The plot thickens. It's still there. It's amazing when you think
*  about how many websites there are that there are any available now. I know. I know. Well, it's funny.
*  Now that I'm getting more popular and stuff like that, I'll get tagged and shit on social media,
*  but there's also an Irish rugby player named Rob Kearney. So they'll sometimes tag him or they'll
*  mean to tag me. So it's weird. Yeah. Well, wait until this is over. Yeah. Once this goes live,
*  it should be real weird. That'd be fantastic. How much you must be getting. I mean, this is the
*  first time probably the LBGTQ community has gotten behind a strongman though. I mean, this is- And
*  even just a pro athlete in general. Really? You know, I think, well, that's like, that's the biggest
*  reason for my Instagram name is just like showing LGBTQ like visibility in pro sports
*  because it doesn't exist. Right. You know, like there's a few. In fighting the UFC, Amanda Nunes
*  is the greatest woman of all time. She's gay. Oh, which is great. And that's a cool, but men,
*  different animal. You know, I think like there's this really big disconnect where like people think
*  like, okay, lesbian women are allowed to be strong. They're allowed to be athletic. They can do all
*  these really cool things. Gay men have to be feminine. They have to be put in this box and they
*  shouldn't be pro athletes. And that's one of the biggest reasons why I'm so, you know, I call myself
*  like unapologetically open about my sexuality because like it really is, you know, the more you
*  think about it, like if you even try to think of like an openly gay man in any pro sport across the
*  world, there's no really mainstream. I think you forgot about Brian Boitano. Oh, don't you
*  remember South Park? What would Brian Boitano do? Yeah. Smart ass. Brian Boitano. I mean, he's a
*  goddamn trailblazer, but yeah, other than figure skating who actively competing in a major sport,
*  there really isn't anything. And I'm not saying like, you know, strong men is by no means like
*  major or mainstream yet, but we're getting there. People know about it for sure. And I think to see
*  like an openly gay man, you know, I say competing and arguably one of the most like hyper masculine
*  sports in the world. You know, I think like, when I think of masculine sports, I think like UFC and
*  lifting shit, right? Yeah. Like, right. Like one, you're beating another dude up. The other one,
*  it's a bunch of guys standing around a weight being like, Oh, I'm going to pick it up. No,
*  I'll pick it up. I'll pick it up faster. You know, like it's like Neanderthal almost. Yeah. That's
*  top of the food chain, manly shit. Exactly. So I think it's like super important to see like an
*  openly gay man in a relationship rocking a rainbow Mohawk and rainbow tights out on a competition
*  floor. I think that makes people feel more comfortable than if you just out there slinging
*  dick. Like if you weren't in a relationship, you were openly gay and just fucking everything that
*  moved. They were like, Hey, this guy can pick up the fucking moon and he could butt fuck you.
*  That was like one of my buddies. He said, he's like, you know, I'm not afraid of you,
*  but what does scare me is if you wanted to rape me, you could,
*  that sounds like he's setting you up. Well, it's like, don't definitely don't read it. But if you
*  were gonna, this is what I think you could do. Grab me right here. Yeah. That's uh, but yeah,
*  those are definitely, I mean, right after fighting, that is the most manly shit picking shit up.
*  Exactly. You know, so I think that's why, like, that's why, you know, I've been so open about my
*  relationship and what I'm doing in the sport and just trying to be more visible for the LGBTQ
*  community in pro sports in general. Um, you know, cause like I said before, like I get a shit ton
*  of hate messages on a daily basis and so all the time. Why do you read it? I love it. Really? Um,
*  and I know a lot of people don't, but like to me, I use it as fuel. Like there's no bigger fuck you
*  to that person than me winning. Right. You know, like, so that's how, that's how I look at it. Like,
*  okay, dude, talk shit about me all you want. I'm the American log press record holder. Yeah. I won
*  in Australia. I'm competing against the top. I'm one of the top 10 strongest men in the world
*  competing at this Arnold strongman classic in March. Um, so that's why I love it. Like I love
*  reading that, but like, it's a funny thing you said to that guy in the audience. I saw it's great.
*  Stronger than you. But the crowd goes silent. My favorite part. Like, is that was California
*  people probably start cheering. Yeah. Well, they, they get, it's Texas. Hey man, what the fuck?
*  He's right. Licking meaners. Um, but totally sidetracked. I'm talking about sucking dick and
*  they, you know, I get it. Um, it's, you would think that you would have a lot of sponsors that
*  would jump in because of this though. I would think because you're open and because this is
*  such a manly sport and it's such a non-stereotypical thing. Yeah. I would think that would be like
*  really positive for the LBGTQ community. Yeah. I mean, let's talk in a week, Joe,
*  let's see what happens after the show. I'm hoping we can help you. It's um, you know,
*  and that's my biggest thing. Like while doing this whole thing is like just trying to spread
*  positivity and love throughout the entire world. You know, I mean, I talk about the hate messages
*  that I get, but like the ones that mean a lot are like, you know, I got a message a few months
*  ago from a 16 year old kid who was on the verge of committing suicide, um, because he couldn't
*  come to terms with the sexuality and he said in his, in his post, like finding my profile,
*  let him be comfortable with himself. You know, that's awesome. Crazy. That's so cool. And it's
*  like, it's, I never expected to be that person just by saying, I love this dude.
*  But that's sometimes how you get to be that person, right? Yeah. Being yourself. Exactly.
*  And I think that's, that's why this whole thing has kind of blown up into what it is and
*  why I'm, you know, fortunate enough to now be working on a documentary.
*  What's the documentary? Um, so we literally are filming our, we, I just met the film crew this
*  week. Um, those guys out there. Yeah. The ones out there. Okay. So, um, I was approached by, um,
*  Andy, who she was on the set of world's strongest man. And she was like, once she saw my husband,
*  I kiss after one of the events, um, like light bulbs just went off and she was like, there's
*  something here. So, um, I was approached about doing a documentary kind of about my life and
*  about being the only openly gay pro strong man in the world. Now are there closeted gay strong
*  men? I'm sure there are. And they just don't talk to you? Probably. You're dangerous. I know. This
*  wild motherfucker with a mohawk. I don't want bitches coming for my title.
*  Right. You want to keep them in the closet. And then more slowly cards start coming out.
*  We're going to have to actually have a contest for this. What if, what if strong men becomes
*  like the WNBA where everyone's gay? Oh, that would suck. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just selfish.
*  I mean, that's a good argument that sponsors won't show up though. Cause fucking everybody
*  knows the WNBA is gay as fuck. True. But it's bad basketball too. Yeah. It's not great. That's not
*  good. Yeah. Like at least strong men, women's sports is awesome. But like, I always think of
*  like the, uh, the family guy episode where they're talking about the WNBA and they're like, oh, and
*  listen to the fan. That's one guy cheering in the fan and stands. Yeah. It's a, it's a tough sell.
*  It is. So, but, but yeah, strong man shouldn't be a tough sell. No. You know, and I think that's
*  the cool thing is like strong men in England is massive. Really? Like we sell out like 15,000
*  seat arenas in the UK. Whoa, really? Yeah. It is huge. What about here? What is it like here?
*  Yesterday or a Saturday in Santa Monica, we had about 1700 people.
*  That's a good crowd. Decent, decent crowd. And then do it right on the pier. Oh no shit. Yeah.
*  Yeah. They, they, you know, did all the permits and shit. Yeah. Bleacher set up at a,
*  and rogue was there to live stream the entire event, which was really cool. I love them.
*  All my shit out there is rogue. They're so cool, man. All their stuff is great. And, um,
*  you know, we're actually, uh, the organization giants live, which is the world's strongest man
*  qualifying tour. They're bringing an arena show to the U S for the first time since like 2010.
*  Um, that's going to be in Daytona beach, um, in August, August 15th. So that's going to be like
*  the first crack at like breaking into the mainstream U S, um, you know, arena venues.
*  Cause like I said, like over in the UK, when I broke the log press record this past April,
*  it was in leads and it was in front of a 12,000 seat crowd. Wow. It was unbelievable. Why do you
*  think it's so popular over there? You know, I think, um, I think the biggest thing is they don't
*  have sports to compete with. Like we do here is many sports. Yeah. Like what do they have? Like
*  decently bad soccer and rugby is their, their soccer bad soccer's not great. Really? Yeah. I
*  thought English is really into that. They are, but doesn't mean it's good. Oh, okay. Um, but yeah,
*  they're not good at rugby either. I think they're pretty good at rugby. Pretty good. Yeah. Then they
*  have like cricket, but like they don't have the NFL. They don't have sense. I don't know. That is
*  nonsense. I just, the, the one thing I know about cricket was like last week, a dude got hit in the
*  balls twice in a row twice. That was on ESPN. That's the only reason I saw it. They show cricket
*  on ESPN because he got hit in the balls twice. Oh, like in the sports center. Yeah. The not top 10.
*  Um, they used to have that late night on ESPN is when you would see strongman competition. Yeah.
*  And, um, since, you know, so we're no longer with ESPN, uh, we've been picked up by IMG and CBS,
*  which is great. So now world's strongest man has aired on CBS and CBS sports. So a little bit more
*  mainstream, which is great. Um, you know, and then, yeah, so it's really exciting. I'm hoping this,
*  I'm hoping the U S can kind of pick it up when it comes to these, uh, these arenas, these arena shows.
*  What can make it more popular? Like what do you think could be done to make people understand? I
*  mean, it's fun to watch for sure. I think the U S like, I think people need to like
*  understand what we're doing. And like, I think there's such a big respect in the UK for strength,
*  you know, like Eddie Hall, the word that he won world's strongest man in 2017, won the contest
*  once and then retired. That's it. Because there hadn't been a winner in the UK since the eighties
*  for world's strongest man. So like, he is just a household name here. That's Eddie. Yeah. I'm
*  not closest to us. Crisis size that gorilla. Yeah. So he's, he's, he also holds it. It looks like a
*  gorilla. He holds big belly. He has the deadlift world record. So he's the only person he
*  deadlifted 500 kilos. So he deadlifted 1100 and two pounds. Um, the size of this fucking guy.
*  So he won world's strongest man and everybody in the UK knows his name. And that's actually where
*  most of my fan base is even is in the UK because this sport is so big and you can see the arena
*  sold out there. This is the last stretch. Jesus. And he, oh, one more. Fuck. See, that's the thing.
*  Like people think strong man just lifting shit. Like we have to be athletic as fuck to do this too.
*  Wow. The tires, what got it for him? Wow. That's crazy that he won with a tire. Yeah. We have to
*  like run. We have to be agile. We have to be able to carry stuff. We have to be able to lift heavy.
*  Oh, that's fifth and sixth place in this video here. Yeah. Fucking that is losers. Yeah. Look
*  at that dude's neck starts around the edges of his shoulders. It's crazy. It's just a tube.
*  Such a fucking nutty sport, man. It is, but it's so much fun. And like when you come and see a live
*  event, it's wild, you know, because like the cool thing about strong men is like everybody, like the
*  fans and the competitors, like you want to see everybody succeed. So it's like one of the few
*  sports where you're like cheering for someone as you're competing against them, which is awesome.
*  Yeah, that is awesome. Like you're kind of seen as a dick. If you, if you finish an event and you
*  walk off and you, and the person next to you still going like everybody's like, dude, what the fuck?
*  Hey, when you compete, do you have like patches on for your sponsors or shit like that?
*  No. Um, so that's, that's a tough part is you have to wear the competition shirt because there are
*  sponsors that pay to be on the t-shirt. Oh, now in between events, if there's interviews and stuff
*  like that, that's when I'll throw in a sponsor shirt, um, to try to get them some TV time that
*  way. Um, but it's also tough because like in the UK, like all of those competitions are aired on TV
*  in the UK in the U S the only time people see strong men on TV is world's strongest man. But what
*  about YouTube? YouTube is growing and that's massive. Now I would feel like that would be the big
*  venue for you. Yeah. You know, you look at Brian Shaw, um, he has like, Oh, he almost like, I think
*  he has like 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube. He's just picking up heavy shit. Huge. Yeah. And
*  it's just like all about him. Like him and his wife will do like eating challenges or the workouts
*  together as an eating challenge with his wife. Yeah. That's how big his wife, she's tiny too.
*  She's like, I don't know. How was she hanging in there with them? That doesn't even make any sense.
*  Well, women get excited about pizza and you know, like eating like that stuff. So,
*  so, cause I, what the reason why I was asking is cause that would used to be the thing back in
*  the early days with MMA fighters that they could make money off of sponsors, sponsors on their,
*  their, you know, their shorts and stuff. Yeah. I mean, to be honest, like
*  shorts and pants, that's a different story. Oh, you can wear sponsors on your shorts. Absolutely.
*  Oh really? So like the competition shirt, JRE patch, I could sponsor your shorts. Totally.
*  Really? Well, I mean, I wear spandex though. So how do you put us, you can put a patch.
*  We'll have to make that. That's always my goal. Like I always try to wear like,
*  that's fine. Sponsor him too. Sorry, bro. He beached in the log.
*  Yeah. So like my goal is to try to wear like the craziest, most outrageous spandex at every
*  contest I go to. Oh yeah. You need sequins. Can you have sequins on yours? I haven't yet.
*  And I don't know why I haven't thought about that. You need them. Like the ones I wore this past
*  weekend were like swirly rainbow. Nice. Yeah. It was awesome. Hot pink with sequins, bro. Yeah.
*  I'm down for that. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Right. I love these ideas, Joe. This is great. Yeah.
*  I'm all about it. All right. And he's spandex people listening. Yeah. It's any, any spandex
*  designers and constructors of spandex. You know how to put together a good secret. You can't,
*  can't the sequence can't fall off. No, no. Cause I'll be deadlift and running. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Anchored, especially deadlifting, right? Cause it's going up your thigh. I think we'd have to do the
*  sequins on the side. Yeah. Yeah. Like racing stripes. Super gay racing stripes. Yeah. I like
*  it. I like it. I like it. Now when you are doing this, like what, what kind of shoes do you guys
*  wear? Because those guys were running, but you're also, I would imagine you have to have something
*  that's very flat with like serious. I'm super bougie. So I bring like five different pairs of
*  shoes to every contest. But what do you prefer? Like what kind of changes every event? Um, depending
*  the brand I go with is innovate. Um, I love all their stuff. I've never heard of them before.
*  It's I N O V eight. Is it a powerlifting only brand lifting? They, so, um, they have lifting
*  shoes that I wear for my overhead events. Um, then I wear like their barefoot shoes. That's what I do
*  for like my moving events and when I deadlift. Um, and then they also have like hiking, like shoes
*  that are like anti slip that I'll use. Like when I do truck pull or pushing events as well.
*  And now are they a sponsor working on it? Come on, innovate. They sent me a bunch of stuff for free.
*  So it's better than nothing. Yeah, no, totally. And they're honestly, they're, they're the most
*  comfortable shoes I've worn when training. Let me see what that looks like. Let me see what them
*  innovate shoes look like. I don't know. Uh, go with the barefoot one. Let me see what that looks like.
*  They're super light too. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I think I like about them too. Even though
*  like their weightlifting shoes are light, cause those are like clunky and heavy and like really
*  like, especially like when I'm doing like a split jerk, trying to move my feet fast. Right.
*  Last thing I want is heavy things on my feet. Okay. So those are the lifting shoes that I have.
*  And I like that. So the platform in the back. Yeah. So they have a raised heel,
*  um, about three quarters of an inch. Now that's for when you're lifting,
*  like it's almost like standing on plates, right? Yeah. So that'd be like if you're squatting,
*  I'm using that. And then I like it for overhead lifts just cause it gives you a little bit more
*  stability. Now, why do you have to stand on plates? Like what is the idea behind that? Like the,
*  to raise the back, raising the heel, it, um, it takes out the issue of ankle mobility in a lift,
*  like a squat. So there's a lot of restriction in the ankle and the Achilles if they're tight
*  and that'll prevent you from that'll either cause or prevent you from your knees tracking properly.
*  It'll put extra strain on the hips and on the ankles. So doing that, it kind of takes the
*  ankle complex out of the motion and makes the movement easier. Can you keep a more upright
*  spine, a little bit more comfortable lift. So that's usually the thought process behind it.
*  So when you have that elevated heel, then you don't have to stand on plates or anything like
*  that. You just use it just like that. Just, just, just a shoe. Yeah. So that it's interesting that
*  there's different, you wear different ones for different events. So the pulling for the truck
*  tire one, you use a hiking ones. That's what you're saying. So this will be my first time using that.
*  Typically we use rock climbing shoes, um, because real grippy, super grippy, and especially like
*  we're pulling on asphalt usually. Um, so that'll dig into the asphalt. These ones that I have from
*  innovate now they're, um, they, they're like anti slip and they have gripping treads on them.
*  So I'm going to be using them for an event called the wheel of pain coming up at the Arnold strongman
*  classic, which is based off of the movie Conan, the barbarian, where you see him pushing that big,
*  yeah, that big implement. So they actually rogue recreated that implement for the Arnold. Yeah. If
*  you can pull a picture of that, it is the most bad ass thing ever. Arnold. So it's like a $300,000
*  piece. Oh, they even did it with the carving and shit. Dude, that's so cool. Wild. So you literally
*  just have to push it. So those big wheels are filled with sand because they'd obviously don't
*  want to make it too easy for us. Um, and you just have to push it in a circle as far as you can in
*  75 seconds. Oh, wow. That's everybody looks fucking exhausted. Oh, 60 seconds. Even better.
*  It just hurts, man. Oh, it looks like it just is. It's like, I mean, you know, like, I mean,
*  you work out. So it's like, imagine even doing something like as simple as like rowing on an
*  erg for 60 seconds, just all out, nonstop guys pushing with his head. Yeah. So this last year
*  was the first year they did this event. Um, and they changed the rules this year where you have
*  to keep your hands on the implement like that, like Brian's doing right there. Cause someone
*  was just using their head. Yeah. So they don't want anybody to do that anymore. It seems like
*  that would crush all your vertebra. Yeah. So you have to keep your hands on the implement at all
*  times and push like that. What a dope design though. I mean, it really does. It looks not
*  a cone. Yeah, it's fucking cool. It's so cool. It's all carved out of wood too. Who built that
*  fucking thing? Rogue. They just hired artists to carve it. Rogue has got the snakes. Everybody.
*  They, I mean, any, anything, anything you could think of, they have people to make it.
*  Their fucking echo bike is the greatest cardio machine thing that I've ever used. Best and worst
*  because it hurts. So it's the best, but look at this fucking thing with the snake heads and everything.
*  Yeah. What a genius. You could see it rolling back when he let go. And that's because there's
*  sand in those big wheels. So you have to push it against sand. So now they have to deconstruct
*  this and bring it back and put it back together again. Cause it's not like you could fucking ship
*  it. And this is the, this is the only contest they use it for. They use it one time a year.
*  He's using his shoulders. Yeah. He's Russian. What do you expect? Oh, the Russian shoulder.
*  That is a crazy thing though. Yeah. You can kind of use your shoulders and push with your hands.
*  Yeah. So, um, so this will be the second time we're doing this event. So they switched it a little
*  bit, have to keep your hands on the implement at all times. And then it's just push until you can't
*  anymore. God damn that's bananas. Look at that. Yeah. Everybody looks so tired.
*  I mean, this is one of those events where like usually like the medics will come over like with
*  oxygen afterwards. It's crazy. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah. And he's got that Russian bray on too. So
*  he actually, he actually isn't the Russian military too. Is he really? He's like the
*  Russian equivalent of like green beret. So he's definitely does strong men on top of that. Yeah.
*  That's a manly motherfucker. He's scary. He's the next guy to come out. He's super nice, but you know,
*  guaranteed. Look at them.
*  You know, he's definitely probably killed some other so free.
*  Rob is so free. Why can't I know what to be? I never think his English is that good. No,
*  it's so bad. No, but they also, I mean, these Eastern Europeans are smart because they'll play
*  dumb on purpose to not listen to the rules and then try to bend them. Oh, really? Oh yeah.
*  Sneaky fuck. Yeah. Like, I don't know, but they fucking know. Yeah. How many Russian guys win it?
*  Cause you would think that would be a thing like Russian. You think of strong people,
*  you think of Russians, Eastern Europeans are always in the mix. Um, but honestly like
*  dominating across the board lately has been us Iceland.
*  And that's about it. Is it because we have the best steroids? It could be.
*  I might have something to do with it. Yeah. Yeah. What kind of testing do they do?
*  Yeah. They just look at me. They test us. Do they? They don't tell us what for.
*  Oh, so nobody gets in trouble. No, I got caught for weed. What? Well, I mean, they said,
*  do you smoke? I was like, well, it's legal in Massachusetts. So yes. And so, okay. Yeah.
*  They're like, all right, cool. I mean, they don't want us like taking coke or like, you know,
*  stuff like that. Um, that's what I would worry about, right? It's like someone getting on
*  amphetamines. Yeah. No, they do test for that. Like they test for like, you know, prescription
*  pills and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know about that. You fucking get really strong on that shit.
*  Apparently you'd probably rip everything apart. I was going to say, it'd probably break your body.
*  Yeah. You probably not. You wouldn't understand the boundaries at all. No, you just go. I had a
*  buddy of mine who got in a fight. He was on PCP and a dude bit off his finger and he didn't even
*  realize it. Now he has a toe that they took. They took his second toe and curved it so he could still
*  punch. So if you shake his hand, his right hand, when he shakes you, he's got the,
*  it takes a new meaning to shake a leg. His pointer fingers index finger is curved. It's
*  curved permanently. So he never, he never has like a flat hand. And it's his fucking toe.
*  That's wild. Yeah. Yeah. Boxing, my old boxing coach. Wow. Shout out to Joe Lake. Hey, but um,
*  yeah. So, um, yeah. So like, they don't want to take us like, they don't want us taking like that
*  kind of stuff. Right. But, um, man, it's pretty much that's it. That makes sense. Just cause it's
*  fucking dangerous to dudes that have heart attacks. Like you push that thing on kind of,
*  it is, it is wild. The amount of medical testing we have to go through before a contest is crazy.
*  I would imagine, um, your heart, the pack, the medical packet that we have to get filled out by
*  our primary cares for world's strongest man is like 48 pages long. But yeah, it's wild, dude.
*  So they bring you in for an exam. How long does that take? We have to get it done on our own.
*  So they send after the invites are done and after the, the lineup is set for world's strongest man,
*  you get the email that it's like, here's the medical packet you need done by this date.
*  Um, and you pretty much have to make an appointment with your primary care
*  and get it all done. So what does your doctor say when you come to him with that fucking 48
*  page packet? Well, luckily I've gone to her a few times with it. So she knows to block off some
*  times. She knows what's up. Yeah. You know what it's, um, but it's, it's smart because like we
*  have to get an EKG, we have to do stress testing. We have to get a full blood panel done. Um,
*  they have to look at everything because they don't want somebody dropping dead on TV.
*  That makes them look pretty fucking bad. Yeah. They would have to make sure that you're not
*  already overtrained to like your creaking levels. And yeah, so they look at everything. I mean,
*  it's a full blood panel. They, like I said, they do the EKG, they look at the heart they do. Um,
*  and then it's, you know, obviously full medical history as well, just everything from parents to
*  past diseases to what runs in the family, everything. And now you guys aren't insured
*  by these competitions, are you? No. So if you tear your fucking hamstring off, it's all on you.
*  Yeah. Fuck man. Yep. God, that seems crazy. It's ballsy. Yeah. It's, it's risky. Yeah. Real,
*  real risky. I mean, that seems kind of crazy that during the competition itself, you're not,
*  you're not covered. It's all on us. Even those medical packets, like they say, like all,
*  all fees associated with this are up to the athlete's expense. And they don't pay that well.
*  If you win, you make decent money. Oh, it's not a lot, right? You know, like to win world's
*  strongest man, you make like 50 grand. Really? That's it? Yeah. For the strongest, strongest man
*  in the world. Yeah. That's to be worth a million bucks. I think so. That's the number. I mean,
*  but look at it. So like world's strongest man has been around since the seventies. I need to see six
*  heroes. I'm going to win the strongest man on the fucking world. That's, that's what I'm talking
*  about. We need you in the sport. This is bullshit. We have the money. It seems like somebody should
*  be able to pony up a million bucks. I would love some big company. I will say so like, you know,
*  we talk about world's strongest man and giants live and that whole series, but then we also have
*  the Arnold circuit. So there's like two big pro circuits for strong men to choose from.
*  The Arnold circuit, they've definitely elevated the game. Right? So the Arnold strong man classic
*  in Ohio is like kind of seen as the most elite competition in the world because only 10 guys
*  qualify for that contest world's strongest man. You get 25 and then the prize money in, in Ohio
*  is better than world's strongest man. It's almost double actually. Yeah. For Arnold. So at the Arnold,
*  so each of the Arnold international shows it's standard prize money. So the Arnold international
*  shows, there was one here in Santa Monica this weekend. There's Australia, South America,
*  South Africa, Europe, Canada. Um, I think that's it, but we all know the prize money going into each
*  show because it's the same at everyone. So it's like 10 grand for first eight, six, four, two, one.
*  So they pay out top six, but they also pay all of our travel there. So it's not too bad. No,
*  but then the big motivation is to get to Ohio, right? Where first place is 85 grand and they
*  pay out all 10 athletes, but like third place at, I think it's second, second or third place at Ohio
*  makes just as much as world's strongest man. So this is probably why you have to compete 40 times
*  a year. I mean, it's kind of imperative. And the thing is like, to be honest, like I didn't really
*  do that well this past weekend in Santa Monica, so I didn't make any money. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh no.
*  Which is a bummer. But it's like, I wasn't like this weekend, like the contest, like,
*  for me, it was more like a gauging. I was trying to gauge where I was at going into Columbus.
*  The events were really similar. So do you do that? Like you have to be careful to not go too crazy
*  in one of these events. So I definitely like held back this weekend. You know, I think I could have
*  hit another gear if I needed to, but already having my qualification to the big show, I like mentally,
*  I don't think I'd have been able to like turn it on. Like I need to, Ohio. And when is Ohio? What
*  date? First week of March. So the contest is the fifth and sixth, I think, or the sixth and seventh.
*  Nothing between right now, which is January 20th and March. So how do you ramp up? Like what,
*  what is your schedule like to prepare for something like that? So the biggest thing,
*  so we look at the events, right? So, you know, I mentioned we have the max deadlift. So
*  my goal is that at a thousand pounds, which would be, which would make me the first person under
*  300 pounds body weight to do that in history. Whoa. Yeah. How close are you? I pulled 970 in July.
*  Jesus Christ. So, God damn, that's a lot of weight. So we're close right there. We're close.
*  Um, and you're only 28. Yeah. You're going to get stronger. Exactly. So if you don't get to 300
*  pounds, if you don't gain too much weight, you can nail it. I don't want to. Like I, I was,
*  I was almost 300. I was like 298 at world's strongest man in 2018. And I was a fat fuck.
*  It was gross. Like I look at my husband, I was like, why did you want it? Like lay next to me.
*  Like I had neck rolls on my neck rolls. I'm like, I was gross. Isn't that a thing? Like some dudes,
*  like bears, they're like, I'm big and hairy. He does. Like, and I totally am a bear, but like,
*  I was an ugly fucking bear, dude. Like a bear just going in. Oh man. I look at pictures. My head
*  looked like a fucking blueberry. I was like, but like, honestly, like 285 is like kind of my sweet
*  spot because I'm still getting stronger, getting a little bit leaner and getting better at the
*  sport. So like, I don't see a reason to get any bigger. Right. Um, but I honestly do think a
*  thousand pounds is doable right now. Well, it seems like if you're 30, 30 pounds away, if you're
*  doing that much weight, 906, I mean, look 30 pounds to a deadlift for a regular person,
*  that's an extra 30 pounds. That's a lot, but not when you're already doing 970 fucking pounds.
*  Yeah. And like to go back to like the prep and like the ramp up to this contest, you know, like
*  before, like this weekend we had, um, the deadlift was a 775 for reps in a minute and I pulled six,
*  which is okay. That's a lot. Like I probably could have pulled seven or eight if I needed to.
*  The winning number was nine. Um, and everybody that ironically, everybody that finished ahead
*  of me in that event has already deadlifted over a thousand pounds. So that made me feel pretty good.
*  Um, but like leading up into these next few weeks, like I'm going to start working like my
*  heaviest deadlift I did before this contest was 850 for one. I'm going to start working up into
*  that load of mid nines, um, in the next couple of weeks and probably have my last heavy, heavy
*  deadlift, probably three weeks before the contest, two and a half weeks before the contest.
*  And then do you deadlift at all before up leading up to the contest? If I do, it'll be light.
*  Very, I say light relative, you know, it's a relative term. 600 pounds. Yeah.
*  So you're just trying to let your body recover.
*  And that's something that a lot of people think, like people forget, like when we're training this
*  hard, like we're beat to shit and like we're like, I, we get stronger when we, when we rest and
*  recover. So I really don't exercise or lift like the week of a contest. Like I'll do my recovery
*  workouts that I talked about before. We're like, I'm just kind of swimming hot tub sauna, that stuff,
*  but I won't lift any weights. Um, and that's cause like my body, like my central nervous system,
*  like everything just needs a break and you get stronger over that period of time. And it's amazing.
*  Does it make you feel like you maybe are over training in other ways? Cause not really that
*  get that much stronger when you take a week off, it almost seems like you should do that more often.
*  No, because I think you need to get to that point where you need to get beat down. You know, like
*  there are some strength coaches out there that like, you know, we call it a D load, right? So it's
*  like where you're ramping up, ramping up, going super heavy, then you back off for a little bit.
*  Right. And so that's what we call a D load. And there's some coaches that give that every fourth
*  week of their program regardless. And I don't agree with that because I don't think anybody can work
*  that hard for three weeks to beat down their body enough where they need it every single fourth week.
*  Normal people don't train hard enough to need regular D loads. The D loads, the guys who practice
*  that way, are they winning or are they not really elite? No. Most of it, like I say that like most
*  of that's like in like, I see a lot of like in the powerlifting community where it's just like
*  squat bench deadlift. But like in all honestly, like I don't feel people, like I feel like you
*  have to earn your D load. And that's like what my coach does with me. Like I went almost six months
*  without a D load leading into this contest. And that happened about a month and a half ago.
*  And I knew I needed it because I was tired every day, regardless of how much sleep I got.
*  I didn't want to go to the gym. Every time I'd get to the end, I was fucking miserable.
*  I just wanted to leave. I didn't want to look at anything. I don't want to talk to anybody.
*  And I texted my coach. I was like, I need a fucking break. And he was like, all right,
*  cool. I was waiting for you to get to that point. But it's, but you know, it's like, it's like,
*  I feel like it's something you have to earn because people like, people think they work hard,
*  but they don't really know what that means until they're like actually pushed to do something.
*  And that's where I got to that point. And that's why like these next five weeks are going to be
*  like super crucial in my training to this contest because I'm going to have to, I'm going to beat
*  my body to shit over these next five weeks. You know, and my husband will probably get pissed off
*  me because I'll be a prick one or two times at least. But it's like, you know, this is the
*  biggest competition in the world. And I know what I need to sacrifice to get to that point.
*  And that's going to mean long training sessions, really hard training sessions. And I'm, you know,
*  just like I said, I'm just going to beat my body down just to reap those rewards at the end of it.
*  Yeah. That's gotta leave you super exhausted. It hurts and cranky and just like,
*  yeah. You know, like I can't remember the last time I woke out of bed,
*  feeling woke up in the morning, like feeling good. Oh, you must be in pain all over the place.
*  Right. Yeah. It all hurts. Yeah. But whatever can still do cool shit.
*  Do you get MRIs and get shit checked out? No, I'm sure I have herniated discs and stuff like that.
*  Like how could you not? My, my, my orthopedic is actually one of my closest friends, ironically.
*  Yeah. Um, you know, but like his whole thing is like, as long as you're feeling good, like why,
*  why look into it? Right. Because then you might freak out. You think about it, right? Like if
*  you know it, if you don't know it, it's not going to hurt. Right. You know, but like, if you see it,
*  then like you start thinking it's like, oh shit. Yeah. I got to imagine your discs are awful. That's
*  why it's so impressive. That was actually six three when I started the sport. That's why it's
*  amazing that guy's 53 and still able to lift such insane amounts of weight. It's crazy.
*  I mean, it's so impressive. And there's actually still a guy, there's a guy here at LA who owns a
*  gym called the training hall in thousand Oaks. That's where Martins trains. His name is owed
*  Haugen name. He's 72 and he still does some, some strength competitions too. What? Yeah. Like he's
*  still dead lift like over 500 pounds. I've seen that guy online. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it is awesome.
*  That's insane. Yeah. He's like the nicest dude ever, but like he has, he has arguably the best
*  grip in the world. Really? Yeah. 72. Yeah. It's crazy. My God. Yeah. He's a freak. No, is that
*  it? Yeah. So it's him. Yeah. I have seen him. Yeah. That is incredible. That's incredible.
*  I think that guy's that jacked. Yeah. And he's like 73. I think, yeah, he just turned 73 this
*  weekend was his birthday training hall. I know where that is. Yeah. Yeah. That's only like 20
*  minutes away from here, man. Yeah. So that's, that's where Martins, the current world's strongest man
*  trains. And then owed is the owner of that place. Wow. That's amazing that you can still get after
*  it at that age. He's so, and he's so cool that that's all of his grip toys. So he has those things
*  called the blob, which they're literally just like probably three inch wide, like weights where you
*  just have to like, and they're smooth on the side where you have to pick them up in like a pinch,
*  a pinch grip style and just hold onto them. Yeah. Thick dumbbells. He has the crush grip stuff.
*  Now what kind of people come to his gym? Just regular folks or everybody there's competitive
*  powerlifters, strong men, Olympic weightlifters, and then just your average person. And that's
*  kind of the thing is like, you know, people think like, especially like my gym back home and lightning
*  fitness, people think like you have to be a competitor to go train there. Like the gym owner,
*  like we have everybody from like professional strong men. We have a woman that squats over 700
*  pounds. She's a sweet heart. I love her. Katrina. She's one of those things like they're bigger than
*  mine. Oh my God. 700 pounds. That's incredible. She's awesome. Is she, uh, she, maybe she was,
*  she competes like one 81, I think. And I think she's maybe like five, seven. She must be a
*  fucking tank. Yeah, she's great. I love her. That's so strong. But then we also have like
*  65 year old grandmothers that are working out at the same time in our gym. Oh, that's cool. Well,
*  you have to, if you want to pay the bills, right? Yeah. I mean, we have, you know, the gym, the gym,
*  I go to like, we have like over 250 members right now. Um, so it's pretty big, but like, you know,
*  we're also in a 15,000 square foot facility that has the best strength equipment, you know, on the
*  East coast, I would say. Oh, really? Oh yeah. Oh wow. Yeah. Like the gym, the gym that we go to,
*  like in the strong man and like strength world is like world renowned. Have you ever been to
*  West side barbell? I haven't to, um, I mean, just to meet Louie Simmons. Oh, absolutely. I mean,
*  I've met him in passing, you know, like I hear stories about him where like he like tore his
*  bicep. Yes. And he was in a sling for like three days and got off, said, fuck this and just
*  extended his arm really fast. Popped the bicep off again. Then started bench pressing. Oh my God.
*  Cause he just couldn't wait for it to heal. Like he told me that he had a shoulder reconstructed.
*  He got shoulder reconstruction. And then when he, his first day back, they made a max out bench.
*  Yep. I'm like, why? I mean, there's guys like Greg Panora, who was a guy that was in the West
*  side versus the world documentary where like he had like the head, he ruptured his patellar tendon,
*  got the surgery done. I think it was the next day was on the bench bench pressing with his leg,
*  like fully extended in an immobilizer. Like he was busting the staples. He was like dripping
*  blood through the bandages, but you know, they had to train man. Jesus Christ. Now going back
*  to what I said, luckily I have my background in sports medicine, so I don't do shit like that.
*  Good for you. Yeah. Yeah. Because we're talking to Louie. I was like, why? Why is it? You gotta
*  fucking do it. That's what you gotta do. Look at him. There's Louie. Crazy bastard. Looks like
*  a mutant. And he, he still does this shit. Look at that crazy. Is that taper tattoos? That's a tattoo.
*  Yeah. Snake all over him. Right. And he's got the Captain America arm band tattoo.
*  That look at the build on him. It's crazy. And he's been doing this shit since the 60s.
*  Look at him. Yeah. Have you seen that documentary? No, I haven't heard. It's awesome. It's super
*  cool. It's the world. You talk about just like intense, yeah, badass motherfuckers that like,
*  all they care about is that the record board in their gym and competing. Yep. Well, we went in
*  there to interview Louie. It was a fucking trip. It was a trip. And then we went and checked out
*  his jam. He gave us a tour of the gym and sick. We had a good time. It was one of the rare ones
*  that Jamie and I did that video. Which one that we shot, like walking around the gym. Oh yeah.
*  Yeah. Never did anything with it. We should put it on YouTube. We can put it in. We put it out.
*  Well, if you ever find yourself in Connecticut, Joe, I know how much you love the state. I fucking
*  love Connecticut. I love it when I see it, when I'm passing over in a plane. We'll bring you into
*  our gym. I would definitely do that. If I was there. It's wild, man. What's it called again?
*  Lightning fitness. So there's like part of Connecticut one more time. It's in South Windsor,
*  Connecticut. So it's just outside of Hartford. Okay. And we have drive a little bit to get
*  45 minutes each way. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but there's like, we, there's essentially like two sides of
*  the gym. There's like the strong man side and the power lifting side, you know, like strong man
*  side, like has every piece of strong man equipment you could think of. Um, so we have Atlas stones
*  from 60 pounds to 530 pounds. We have logs, we have monster dumbbells, we have the farmer's walks,
*  there's turf, there's tires from 250 to a thousand pounds. Then the power lifting side is where we
*  have like the mono lifts, all the squat racks, and then all the isolation, like bodybuilding
*  machines as well. So it's like, yeah, it's like a 15,000 square foot gym. And you live in
*  Springfield live in West outside Springfield, Western Mass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Town called Wilbur him. So I know where that is. Yeah. I just do gigs out in Western Massachusetts.
*  Yeah. When I lived in Boston, I used to drive out there. Yeah. Like where Pittsburgh,
*  Oh, wow. Like, basically like New York state. Holy cow. Yeah. I did. That's what I heard.
*  Okay. Yeah. So I, um, I, yeah, I used to the, so I, I just left working full time. I worked in the
*  boarding school world for a long time. Did you? That's why I'm like in the Western Mass area.
*  And, uh, we lived in East Hampton, which is a super, super awesome little town. Um, yeah. So
*  that's wild that you're Western Massachusetts is a trip. It's a cool spot. It's not bad, man. It's
*  great. You know, like I think it's fucked though right now it sucks. Like my husband flew home this
*  morning and, uh, we got a snowstorm yesterday. So he's flying. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm flying home
*  tonight and we know I'm going back to like six inches of snow. So that's great. It builds
*  character. Yeah. It's great. But then like we live there. We also have the, like it's, it's really
*  cool. Cause like we get four seasons, you know, like we, there was a stretch this summer. It was
*  like one 10 for three days in a row. Really? It was super hot. That's just global warming. Fuck it.
*  When? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you least you get that, that, you know, the appreciation for summer,
*  for sure. I mean, and even in the summer, it's like, it's pretty, it's like between, I would say
*  like we have an average of like 85 and 90 every day in the summer. So it's pretty warm. Where's
*  the strong man hot bed? Like if there was a place where you get, like, if you want to be an actor,
*  you move to LA, right? If you want to be a strong man, is there a place where you go to?
*  I really don't think there is. Um, it's because like, I would say in the U S there's only like
*  four or five guys that are doing it really, really well at a really high level. You know, it's, it's
*  me, Oberst, Jerry Pritchett, Brian Shaw, Martins. Um, and then there's Nick Best in Vegas as well.
*  So probably like six of us and we're all over the place. You know, there's me, I'm the only one in
*  the East coast. Um, and then there's Brian in Colorado. Martins is out here. Jerry's in Phoenix.
*  Oberst is, I think he's in Iowa now, I think. Um, and then, uh, Nick Best in Vegas. So we're kind
*  of like spread out all over the place. Um, and that's a cool thing. Like strong man, like we'll
*  do, um, like I get hired to do like seminars all over the U S and all over the world. We're like,
*  gyms will pay me to come into their gym for a weekend, like teach people, you know, from my
*  experience and like different gym lifts and stuff like that. Um, so that's pretty much it. There's
*  really no, like one place, you know, like powerlifting has West side, but there really isn't that,
*  that culture around strong man. Um, would there be any benefit to training with some other top
*  level guy? Like, you know, like for fighters, they want to go and train in the gym with his
*  other top level fighters, cause they push each other and inspire each other and iron sharpens
*  iron, all that jazz. And, um, at the top level, we tried to do that as much as possible. You know,
*  I just don't think none of us are like willing to move our families and our lives around just for
*  that. Cause we realized what the sport is, you know? I mean, fighters, it'd be worth it when
*  you're making a million bucks a fight. Um, for us, it's not that level, but you know, Martins,
*  he flew out to Massachusetts this past summer to train with me, even though he had just one
*  world strongest man, there's events that I'm better than him at. Um, and that's why he flew
*  out to me because he had a contest coming up where those events were in it. So what events
*  you really shine in? Uh, log presses, my bread and butter as we talked about. Then there's, uh,
*  the yolk walk, which is, you know, the crossbar was staying, picking up on your back and walk with
*  it. Um, you know, that's one event that I'm really well known for as well. And that's one that
*  Martins tends to struggle at. So why are you so good at that? What's the deal? Um, people call
*  me like Fred Flintstone of strong man. Like I just move my feet really, really quick. Uh,
*  I don't know. Like I just got, I, for some reason I just like, you know, feeling super heavy weight
*  on my back and moving quick with it. You know, world strongest man, we had a 1350 pounds on that
*  thing. Oh God. Yeah. It was, it was a bitch and that was actually at the end of a medley. So we
*  had a farmer's walk that was 330 pounds per hand. And then we had to pick up a, a 1,000 pound yolk
*  and then the 1315. Oh my God. Yeah. And I was the only one in my group to actually finish that event,
*  which was pretty wild. God damn you at the end of something like that, all your tissues must be so
*  torn apart. Like, yeah, it was like, I mean, you talk about like cranial pressure, like my,
*  I felt like my eyes were purple.
*  Just from all the blood in your head. It was wild. Yeah. I would imagine right. That kind of cream.
*  Have you ever, do you, do you know what happens when you fly in a jet? It's going like the G
*  forces and stuff. You know, you have to, they call it hooking where you like to hold onto the handle.
*  You gotta go like this and then you're forcing that's pretty much what we're doing. Because
*  with strong man, like when you have 1300 pounds on your back, like you're not going to breathe that
*  well, like you can't really expand your lungs and your ribs to breathe properly. You're almost
*  holding your breath. So, and that's with most of our stuff. Like I hold my breath whenever I do
*  moving events and I just try to exhale and inhale as short and as small as possible just to get
*  enough. So I don't pass out pretty much. Does anybody pass out all the time? One of my, one of
*  my good friends at the world's strongest man in the Philippines on 2018, we were carrying like a
*  330 pound sandbag and like the way he carried it was just like resting right on his diaphragm
*  and he didn't pick it up high enough to go onto the platform. So he just ran into the platform,
*  fell backwards and was just out cold and Magnus Vermagnusen is standing right next to him. Another
*  awesome name. Great name. Didn't twitch, didn't move a muscle. He just goes, that's all he did.
*  I just raised his hand. He's done. He must've died. So, you know, so it was just like,
*  I mean, passing out is kind of like a normal part of what we do. I can only imagine. It doesn't sound,
*  it doesn't sound good when I'm saying it out loud, but well, it makes sense though. I mean,
*  the fucking exertion. Does anybody have heart attacks? Not typically. Um, it's, it has happened.
*  How often does it happen? Um, the only person that comes to mind is a guy. Uh, I can't remember
*  what year his name was Jesse Morundee and, um, he, he did have a heart attack in the gym when he
*  was training and that's how he passed away. And he was only, I believe he was only 28 or 29 years old.
*  It happens in jujitsu. Yeah. Um, guys get heart attacks training. And then, you know, I mean,
*  another thing is like sleep apnea because the guys are so big. So that causes a lot of stress on the
*  heart. Do you use a CPAP machine or anything? I don't. Um, I, I don't need one. You know,
*  I'm pretty fortunate, um, that I don't have that issue when I sleep. Um, you know, but a
*  previous coach of mine, Mike Jenkins, he passed away in 2013, um, because of sleep apnea and,
*  you know, just the strain on his heart. So it's not good. It's basically like not sleeping.
*  Yeah. I mean, you're in suffocating yourself. Yeah. It's crazy. So a lot of the guys at this
*  level do, but I mean that, but that's mainly like, cause of their size. Do you have it? Really?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's my, I have a fat tongue and my neck.
*  But that's all the years of fighting, like with that neck musculature and all that development
*  there. Um, yeah, for some reason, like I've kind of, you know, got lucky football players have it
*  for sure. I think when you want, once you get around that 300 pound body weight, like,
*  do you snore? Not terribly interesting on planes. I do, but that's cause my fucking
*  fat mouth just opens up and yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Planes. It's not a good place to sleep.
*  No, or just sit in general when you're near 300 pounds. It's so fascinating to me when you think
*  about people that explore the boundaries of what a human body is capable of. And strong man is like
*  what there's like guys who do like David Goggins to do like the ultra marathons, but strong man
*  is like, that's another form of this extreme pushing of the boundaries of what, what a body
*  is capable of. And when you look at the progression of the sport, it just hasn't slowed down. Like if
*  anything, it's gotten even like the weights keep getting heavier every year. Everybody keeps getting
*  faster. And like all of us were like, when the fuck is this going to stop? You know, like we show up
*  to a contest and they're like, all right, we, we, there was literally a contest in 2018 where the
*  deadlift was 880 pounds for reps. That's so much weight. What the fuck, dude. And that was a
*  motherfucker that pulled over five. That is so much. It's crazy. And so it's like, all of us are like,
*  where does it stop? Like, does it stop? You know, like the, the log press world record is 502 pounds
*  overhead right now. God damn it. You know, it's just like these crazy outlandish numbers, but like
*  the people, like we keep doing them. So I guess we're doing it to ourselves to a point.
*  I guess so. But do you like, what is pushing? Is it just that you, is it a preconceived idea
*  what's possible? And now that the bar has been moved and now you realize that,
*  or is it just that people are more scientific about their training now?
*  I think that's what it is. I think it's, and it's also like when you, the, the evolution of
*  equipment over the years, you know, like with Rogue being our main equipment sponsor now,
*  they make all strongman equipment. So like regular people have strongman equipment in their gyms,
*  you know, like they're like PT clinics that have farmers handles in them for people to work on
*  core, musculature and posture when they're walking. So I think just like the general availability of
*  strongman equipment has made it easier for people to train it more regularly and get better at the
*  events because you, we have to practice, you know, like being strong is great,
*  but you have to be able to manipulate the movement and manipulate the implement to work.
*  And that's where just like the training and the practice portion of it comes in.
*  So I think that's why we've seen, you know, a lot of these weights being pushed so much further
*  because everybody pretty much has regular access to the strongman implants now.
*  It's, it's just, it's interesting to me that you're saying that the weights are getting
*  heavier and people are getting faster. It's like, and then I'm thinking like,
*  how long have people been doing this? When was the first strongman competition?
*  I mean, strongman dates back to like the 1700s.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  That kind of shit like barrel throws and yeah.
*  Really? I mean, when Rob was on, you know, he was talking about the show strongest man in history.
*  That was just on history channel and they, they went back into the history books to look at
*  old, you know, quote unquote strong men doing these strengths, these feats of strength
*  all throughout, you know, I think one of the most notable names is Louis Sear, a guy from Canada,
*  who was about my size actually, and is revered to be one of the strongest men in history.
*  And so when he was doing like these dumbbell lifts and these back lifts and these hip and
*  thigh lifts and stuff like that. So strong man has been around for a long time, but world's
*  strongest man didn't become a thing until the seventies. That's when world's strongest man,
*  I think 77 was the first year of world's strongest man. And that's when it kind of became
*  a sport, you know, and not just a, a kind of a hobby, I guess.
*  So how do they determine what stuff you're going to do for the world's strongest man? Did they,
*  I mean, did they have a panel of experts that sit down and devise each individual event?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's, it's come a long way from what it was in the seventies. I mean,
*  they used to do like medleys with like potato sack braces back at world's strongest man
*  a long time ago. Now it's a little more standardized where they do have like a committee
*  where it's, you know, people from the strong man circuit and judges and stuff like that,
*  but they also bring TV execs because they want stuff that's going to look cool.
*  You know, and I think that's a great thing because you don't want to like stuff that is cool to me
*  isn't going to look cool to somebody that doesn't know anything about the sport sometimes.
*  So, um, when they choose the events, like pulling two monster trucks, like, okay, one it's,
*  you have to be strong as fuck to be able to do it, but it also looks really cool on TV.
*  So they try to find that marriage of, of both of those things to make it the most pleasing to
*  the average person, but also impressive. Exactly. You know, like the deadlift event,
*  they don't have us. Yeah. So, oh, this is that's Mark. That's Mark Felix. Yeah. So this is, uh,
*  one of the world records that he did. And how old is he when he's doing this? This was 53.
*  Jesus Christ. So this was actually just this past July. This was at a Wembley Wembley stadium. Oh,
*  my God. Or well, the arena in London, the Hercules hold what a great name. So each of those pillars
*  weighs 400 pounds and he's just chilling and you just have to hold it as long as you can.
*  What a size of his fucking shoulders. Yeah, that is preposterous. It's dumb. That dude has
*  preposterous muscles. That's so crap. How long does he hold his fucker? He goes over one minute.
*  Oh my God. It's crazy. So this is a world record. What kind of after this is what?
*  One 22 drops it. Yeah. What kind of breathing you doing here? Like does it help to breathe in
*  deep and heavy or just during an event like this? He looks 30. That is crazy. That's exactly dude.
*  Black don't crack. They're not lying. That guy looks amazing. So with an event like that,
*  it's more just really like trying to relax and getting into like a calm mental state
*  because you don't want to be super revved up because you're not moving. You're just focusing
*  on your grip. And that's the biggest thing for an event like that. But then there's also events
*  where like, okay, when you're maxing your deadlift, you do have to hold your breath.
*  Right. So it's different for everything you do. Look, there's the hands.
*  Shake it. It goes up to his wrist. That's incredible. That's amazing though,
*  that he could hold those fucking things for that long. What's like a minute?
*  And I was something minute 23 seconds. And for reference, like I was at that contest and did it
*  for like 42 seconds. Oh my God. It's crazy. Now, how do you prepare for something like that? Do you
*  like, you don't hold those things like, do you just work on your grip? No, usually I'm honestly
*  set up like a pulley system in the gym. So I'll use just like regular handles that you use on
*  like a cable machine, set up a pulley on like a squat rack or like one of the rogue rigs
*  have a loading pins coming down, stack weights on that. And then just holding. Yeah. Or even just
*  doing something as simple like pull up holds, like dead hangs from a barbell or from a pull-up bar.
*  How long can you dead hang for? I've done over a minute. That's impressive.
*  Guys that heavy. Yeah. Yeah. So honestly, usually would go to my shoulders. Usually get tired
*  before anything else. Just from, yeah, just from like holding it. And so you must have like crazy
*  tears all over the place and shit. Like if you ever got your, your labrums checked or anything
*  like that. Good. It must know. I'm looking at you pressing that 250 pound thing over your fucking
*  head. Like that ain't, that's not normal shoulder pressure. No, it's not. But like if you do it
*  safely and correctly, but you know, it's also taken 10 years to get to that point, right? Right.
*  You know, like that's funny, you know, like I have the American log press record, but like overhead
*  was my weakest lift when I started the sport. I sucked at putting stuff overhead. You just focused
*  on it so much. Yeah. And like I said before, like I became a student of the sport. So I was looking
*  at what was working it up for other guys, what wasn't working and trying to find that balance
*  of what I could make work for me. So luckily, yeah, like I said, I've been pretty injury free
*  and healthy the entire time. That's pretty amazing. Well, listen, man, I appreciate you
*  coming in here. Thank you so much. I hope this gives you some more attention and let people know
*  how fucking impressive it is. I appreciate it. And I really love your, your Instagram, man. You're,
*  you're an inspirational guy. You're very positive. It's very, it's a happy, fun page too. It's
*  I appreciate it. I try. And that's, uh, you know, the one, everything I post and everything, you
*  know, I just, like I said, I try to spread the message of love, positivity, and just, you know,
*  inspiration with everything that I do. So, well, no pun intended. I'm pulling for you to get that
*  hunt a thousand pounds. Thank you. And, uh, I appreciate you being here, man. Appreciate it.
*  Thank you very much. Great to meet you. Bye everybody. That was awesome. Sweet. Thank you.
