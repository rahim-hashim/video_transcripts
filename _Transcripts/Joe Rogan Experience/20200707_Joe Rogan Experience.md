# Joe Rogan Experience #1503 - Josh Barnett
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAoo7oXtyy4)
*  Two one demons demons demons be gone demons. I'll take them
*  I'll just you know absorb them into your soul sure enough and kill them with your own darkness
*  That's probably possible, you know just a beard alone might scare them off could be I've definitely always got the soundtrack for it
*  How long even drawn that fucker?
*  Here actually has taken quite a long time. I am NOT of the sort who who is prone to growing
*  Facial hair and shit like it took me until probably 36 before I had a single chest hair what oh yeah, really?
*  Yeah, I blame the the Native American side of my house. That's crazy. Yeah, yeah
*  I'm I've got back hair now like full back hair
*  Something over the last like from the time I was like probably 35. I started growing like serious back hair now
*  I'm 52 and you know, I'm not like who's that Russian wrestler dude. This is one. Oh
*  Well, there was this guy
*  Victor Zangief who who actually did professional wrestling that guy was just coated in it. Oh, yeah
*  There's another guy Salman Hashimikov also
*  He's just a fur coat. Who's the there was one?
*  Wrestler who had he done a bunch of films and stuff
*  George the animal steel. Oh, well, yeah him
*  Teacher or something like that in real life. Yeah, that's like that. Look at him
*  Full on gorilla, I mean that guy was a fucking werewolf
*  When you got a head like that it's like you're always walking under a full moon
*  He said he was in a bunch of like arthouse movies. I could see that well
*  There was also a guy named Tor something who is in plan nine from outer space
*  Oh, and he was also a professional wrestler. Well, I mean they're acting all the time
*  Is this like the hairiest wrestlers is that what you pulled up?
*  I bet you I bet you if you put in the hairiest wrestlers feet, I'm sure that would show up, too
*  Yeah, the Russian guy is a current competitive grappler and he's built like a brick shithouse and he's covered in hair
*  Yeah, he's like everything Harry's fuck. Yeah, so I'm not naturally all that prone to being particularly hairy
*  But your beard is so uniform. It's beautiful. It's like the front part is dark and the sides are perfectly white
*  I mean doesn't get any better than that, you know, it's it's just it's coming in kind of nice
*  Yeah, I use all the right lotions and tinctures ungeants. Did you use lotions?
*  Not a very high maintenance guy every now and again
*  I will put some beard oil in it, but that's about it beard oil
*  Yeah oil and it's mainly because I'm just trying to keep the the knots out of it
*  Yeah, people will look down upon you if you groom your beard hair in any way for some strange reason
*  I have seen that
*  Touches this
*  Possibly like you can shave but you can't trim. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, you gotta let this shit just go to me
*  This is full will to power right here
*  It just does what it wants to do and get stronger every day if you took your pubic hair, it's an immediate crown
*  Oh for sure. Yeah, you just you just can't do that formulated that into your your
*  Your monument to your cock
*  There was a guy who was a UFC fighter
*  Did he had a hair up and oh Brian Brian ever saw? Yeah
*  Skillful guy very very skillful very slick. He was a guy that had fuck man
*  He's like a Jeremy Horn type character with like a hundred plus fights. Yes. There he is. Yeah, I
*  Never saw a guy more calm cool and collected in a fight before you know, I'm surprised that he has it pointing upwards
*  Like you know hit here instead of but I guess the nature of chest hairs is as such
*  Yeah, maybe just wanted to avoid nut shots
*  There you go. You got the very manicured one. Yeah. Yeah, I like that one a lot. He probably waxed
*  To finish that off. Yeah, those nice lines had someone do it someone really talented
*  That's like a broadhead. I mean that looks like like a real serious broadhead
*  Like he knows what he's doing
*  He's out there. He ain't fucking around when it comes to his chest hair. Yeah that guy he
*  Just I don't know what happened. He just stopped
*  I don't know if I don't think he's I think he'd retired but he had so many so many fights
*  Well, you got to figure you know, what what is the
*  What what is the the length of time that you can continue to be an athlete?
*  And I've said this to a lot of folks and that is you don't know what your athletic window is, right?
*  Especially when you create something exceptional like you start if you're an Olympic athlete or your world-class athlete or professional athlete as you continue to
*  move up the ladder of a
*  Difficulty so to speak the shorter the window is that you can compete at that level obviously, but everybody's athletic window is
*  Limited so the length of time you can be a competitive fighter
*  Is you know, who knows how long I guess I've seen some stats that say
*  Over five years it starts to decline over seven or around seven. It really starts to take a nosedive
*  Yeah, they say for a pro MMA fighter. It's like you have nine years to compete at a very high level
*  But that's who's they and even then that nine years is still more towards the tails and not and not into the middle of it
*  And I mean a lot of folks you'll see him you'll get to the UFC
*  They are there for about three four years and then even towards that tail end of that four years
*  It's like they're no longer in company in in the running for any of the major fights
*  Yeah, I think for people on the outside. I don't think they understand what's going on in terms of injuries wear and tear
*  Just the overall punishment that your body takes through the grueling sessions training sessions sparring. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're you're doing
*  Untold amounts of damage to your body and there's of course a matter of
*  Chance in terms of oh did somebody roll into your knee that day or not or did you just land a punch wrong?
*  I mean, there's all kinds of other factors. It just can't be accounted for that's why it's kind of crazy
*  We see a high-level fighter who's like training for a world championship fight and they're in one of those
*  Group class environments wherever there's like 13 other dudes around them and they're like Jesus Christ. Yeah, that's so risky
*  It is and I think a lot of it stems from the origin of MMA it's
*  Being derived from wrestling from the jiu-jitsu from martial arts structured elements
*  But also the money wasn't there for dedicated trainer manager types
*  well, it's like as soon as the manager construct came into
*  MMA and I say construct because I don't think most MMA managers are actual managers. They're mostly just agents
*  They just they find fights and whatever and they'll get a collective of other
*  fighters under their wings so they can have some sort of collective bargaining by having these other athletes or
*  always being able to shuttle somebody in depending on what a
*  The UFC or some other organization might need but they're not really overseeing someone's career, right?
*  We should talk about that like what that means what you're essentially saying is they're not like a boxing manager
*  Will slowly build you towards a world title fight and a UFC fighter doesn't really get that opportunity
*  No, that's true. And part of it is because I would say a lot of these
*  quote-unquote managers want to fast-track an athlete into getting the money and
*  With boxing managers and there are times where people are fast-track look at Lomachenko
*  So he was such of a high level that he's already being put into the the the big
*  High-dollar man in MMA John Jones where it actually worked. Yes, you know fast-tracked
*  But or yourself the youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion true
*  But I did have 24 fights by the time I ever hit the UFC or something like that, but you still what were you?
*  23 when I was 24 when I won 20 yeah, that's still very young particularly for a heavyweight, right? Yes
*  Yeah
*  No, it is quite young and it's it lasted as the youngest UFC champion of all time until
*  John Jones beat it by like a few months or something like that my age when he won his title, but
*  but these
*  management types
*  Came into the to the fold and then they're like, well, you know
*  We we get 33% or 20% or all these different sentences 33 there are ones out there that
*  There was a case around a fighter suing his former manager and the manager was getting 33 and a third
*  So which I guess was the maximum allowable by California standards, I believe
*  But that seems so wrong. It does seem wrong. But the other thing about this and the way I approached it was
*  You you get these numbers you get these ideas from boxing and these other these other avenues that are more established
*  But here's the thing a boxing manager will take a fighter
*  House them in the cat skills or whatever take him to Big Bear put him in a home pay for sparring partners
*  so on and so forth and the amount of
*  actual management in terms of logistics and everything else going around someone's career is
*  Being is is vastly different from just oh, yeah. Well, I called up the UFC and said yeah, I'll throw you in in two weeks
*  Right. Yeah, the same thing and you think you deserve 33 and a third percent for that with my fighters
*  I tell them look once I can make you over 10 grand start paying me
*  Because other than that like what am I gonna do with your 200 bucks, right?
*  Are you managing guys or training? I have actually been managing fighters since
*  Early 2000s. No shit. Yeah, I didn't know that you were training guys. Yeah. No, I
*  Started off with managing Megumi Fuji's career
*  Got her her first fights in the the US helped her turn pro all that and
*  Negotiated her Bellator deals all that kind of stuff and then I managed Victor Henry as for like a more modern
*  Athlete I'm working with Victor Henry. He's on eight fight winning streak. He's probably next in line to fight for a title in Ryzen
*  He's been kicking the crap out of people in Ryzen D. He's the deep world champion
*  He's beating people up in Russia
*  And the thing is, you know people are so concerned about just the UFC or the American market
*  Which I get it. It is the largest market
*  It is the most notable and it has incredible fighters in it, but there's incredible fighters everywhere and there's also that process towards
*  Graduating a fighter up to their to their best position and giving them the best experience for that fighter
*  And I was just talking to someone at the UFC the other day about Victor and he goes
*  You're doing the right thing with him. You know, you're building him up
*  You're you're making him the best version of himself
*  He can be and you're taking care of him and getting him paid and you know
*  That's that's part of the experience and also I try to make sure to give my fighters the experience of being around the world
*  Seeing the world there's nothing that will change your outlook towards being in other places, especially the more
*  disparate from what you're used to and I took I got a great fighter
*  named AJ Bryant at featherweight and I took him all the way over to
*  Khabarovsk Russia, whoa, and yeah, it was a real eye-opening experience
*  but the thing was it was eye-opening in all the right ways and
*  he had such a blast being in such a different environment and and getting to be really out of his his comfort zone and
*  You know, I live to do stuff like that for my fighters. Yeah, that's growth as a human exactly
*  Which will translate into growth as a fighter. I don't see how it won't especially I think within the
*  Within that overall apparatus of fighting and the constant
*  Fail failure to succeed
*  Rhetoric you could you just can't come out and and immediately
*  Win at everything that you're trying to do and you won't come out and immediately be great at everything you do, right?
*  Some things sure but it's about the overall
*  Path of all of this it's about your overall growth and where you started and where you end up
*  And I think if you look at the overall talent pool in the world
*  It used to be that the the elite fighters were all either at pride or at UFC
*  That's what it used to be. But now like you see when Eddie Alvarez went over to one he fought that Timothy
*  Natsuyuken. Yes. Yeah, you can is a bad motherfucker. He must be if he's beaten Eddie Alvarez
*  I'll be tough as shit. Yeah, and and Eddie Alvarez, of course former UFC champion is world-class
*  To see him get beat down by that guy you go
*  Well, these motherfuckers are out there and the talent level so high like there's guys that get to the UFC
*  And when they right when they get here you go, holy shit. Where's this guy been like pure? Yeah
*  Who's fighting?
*  He's fighting for the title this weekend against Jose Aldo and pure
*  Yon is this badass Russian dude who's fucking vicious and when he first came over to the UFC, I'm like Jesus Christ
*  Where's this guy been it's like you see these guys who are all over the world now
*  You know you see an elite world-class fighters and it's it's not just the UFC anymore
*  Like I firmly believe Douglas Lima is one of the best welterweights on the planet. If not, if not the best
*  Yeah, he's got an incredible
*  Dynamism to his game and he just he's his offensive capabilities are just absolutely deadly deadly
*  Yeah, he finds holes, you know, I mean for him to not know page
*  But we're not talking about my dating life
*  I mean for him to knock out Michael page like that. I mean page is hard to even hit that guy
*  He is he's very elusive and I know what people like to really rag on page
*  I think he's awesome. Yeah me too, man, and I met the kid
*  It's so weird to think that everybody's kind of like kid to me now, but
*  I
*  Youngest ever UFC champion. Oh, here you go. There's still some people I'm sure I'm kid to like Mark Coleman
*  I'm sure he'll always call me kid and and and or Jean LaBelle or Jean LaBelle
*  Yeah, 100%
*  Yeah, if you ever come across Jean if you if my name comes out of your mouth, he's gonna go well tell tell him
*  Uncle Jean said
*  Thanks for teaching. I'm a Kimura
*  It never ends I mean double wristlock he's a character
*  Yeah, he's I love uncle Jean me too. I absolutely do but there's great fighters everywhere and really promotions
*  one of their their biggest
*  One of their biggest duties is to find them to cultivate those fighters. They're not great just because they're in your organization
*  They're great because you your organization finds great fighters, right?
*  Right. Yeah, they're out there
*  And I mean if you think about just the level of awareness of elite fighters now
*  Because of YouTube and because of all these different streaming services
*  I mean you can watch you could be anywhere in the world and watch top flight talent. It's not a surprise anymore
*  There's even amazing guys out there like Jack slack and Lawrence Kenshin that do breakdowns
*  Yeah on specific fights fighters and specific techniques
*  Where if I send Jack slack and Lawrence Kenshin stuff to my team all the time in group chats like watch this
*  Yeah, watch this. Yes. Yes, you know if any of them pick up like a teep like Sam art then I'm like
*  Job done. Yeah, and I didn't have to do anything about it
*  It's even better those clips are so great too because they'll highlight a specific technique
*  They'll show the the ko or the finish and then they'll break down all the different moving parts
*  Like both those guys are fantastic at Robin Black's created as Robin glad pink. Yeah, Robin Black
*  Very entertaining to he's a really entertaining person, you know, so and his enthusiasm for martial arts really comes through
*  I do love his sincerity. Yeah, that's just a thing that is missing
*  You know sincerity and authenticity and anything you do and just like we talked about
*  the the the Rogan man cave, but it's not about being a man cave this place is an
*  Extension of everything that you're trying to create for yourself and that is honestly
*  Whether you have the means to create
*  Something like this or you just have the means to create something really small in your own little apartment
*  I mean like everything that you do should be
*  In worship so to speak to what you're the ideal you're trying to create right?
*  Yeah, and you can't do that if you're insincere you can't do that
*  If you're if you're just trying to be the packaging and not the item
*  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier that there's too many and I think this is part of the problem with social media is that people are
*  Intoxicated with this idea of having other people think they're awesome
*  So they they put out all this stuff to make it look like you know, like they're this
*  Amazing person and you know, they'll put up these quotes and put up this shit
*  It's not really what they're into they just want you to think they're into it and it comes off that way like you get
*  like one of my biggest pet peeves like and I was gonna I posted a quote last night or not a quote rather but an
*  image of
*  Miyamoto Musashi because I got I got into the book of five rings again
*  I cannot wait to hear what what just
*  Criticism somehow came out of nowhere to tell you what a jerk you were how wrong you know
*  I don't know if there is my didn't pay attention
*  But what I was gonna criticize is I was gonna say that I have an issue
*  With there's a lot of people
*  Online it's not even that I have an issue. It doesn't resonate with me. This is a better way of putting it without being negative
*  There's so many people that are posting motivational shit, but they haven't done anything
*  True. It is trying to be the I'm trying to be the packaging
*  Yeah, you can do this if you feel that go do this. This is this is how you go get it
*  What the fuck have you done you have to do something and I didn't say this last night
*  But this is what I meant when I posted it like if you want to take inspiration
*  There's something about the words of Miyamoto Musashi that are profoundly inspirational
*  Because he's a man who bested over 60 men in one-on-one sword fights
*  So when he's talking about strategy or he's talking about technique and he's talking about preparation
*  You must research this you must look into this and this is how you go this is how you go about
*  Attacking this is how this is how you play off your opponent's strategy
*  He's talking about life or death with a fucking sword
*  You can't get more serious and it comes through in his words man even translation from Japanese to English even though it's 400 years later
*  There's something about that guy that it gives me goosebumps man when I read his shit all I
*  fell in love with samurai philosophy a long time ago from
*  What Nitobe and the Hagekure and there's even one called a
*  Budo or samurai
*  Philosophy of the Samurai's it I forget the name of it, but it's a really short
*  succinct book that really nails down some things and I think part of why what they have to say is so
*  So so authentic and so so
*  Real so to speak is because it's life or death for them you're reading storm of seal by Ernst Junger and
*  You're reading this guy's take on being in World War one, and it's not that he was never afraid
*  It's not that he didn't understand
*  What war is it's just but him from his position as a soldier in the way he approached things in the way
*  He even still saw beauty in these moments in living in that part of his life
*  it's it's clearly somebody that
*  That I believe has a good grip on being towards death as Heidegger would put it like being
*  Embracing what it means to be alive and by embracing that you're also embracing the fact that you are gonna die
*  it is not going away that that death is alongside you and you don't know when it's coming and
*  There's no need to because you're not supposed to be thinking about whether or not you're gonna die or when it's gonna come or anything
*  Like that, but you're you need to be thinking about what you're gonna do before that time does show up
*  And how you're gonna do it and for why you know, what is it?
*  How are you finding meaning and fulfillment in life so that when when death comes along and tugs on your shoulder and on your shirt sleeve?
*  You're like, all right. Well, this is it. Yeah, and those guys
*  People that you've described whether it's Musashi or any of those people what what comes out in their words is authenticity
*  Because of the fact that they have led these extraordinary lives and they have faced incredible danger
*  They have lived there's there's something about that where you can genuinely learn from those people
*  Whereas there's a lot of people that really haven't but they know that people long for those things
*  so they try to recreate it they try to recreate these quotes or they try to
*  find some words that will inspire you to get going and and
*  seize the moment and make the most of the the day and go out there and conquer and right and
*  Kick-ass and it doesn't mean anything. It's all persona
*  Yeah, it is attempting to take on it's presenting the persona of that kind of individual mainly because they know that
*  Deep down all of us realize that there's weight to those kind of yes, you know
*  And I'm sure Peterson would be like it's the bloody archetype
*  He's an example as well, I mean when he talks about whatever he's talking about word, you know, he's talking about
*  Gulag archipelago or anything he's talking about it from a place of profound understanding
*  And that resonates like when when he critiques Marxism or critiques
*  certain philosophies and certain certain trends that he sees in social
*  Social behavior like he's doing it from a place of profound understanding and that's that's why it resonates with people
*  That's why he became so famous that people think somehow or another
*  That he became so famous because there's an angst in a lot of like weak men
*  Sure, he tapped into that's the typical surface level. Yeah
*  The surface level diagnosis of all these kind of thing or prognosis, but the thing is even as much as
*  You know to put it in perspective, so I have my own journey dealing with with
*  Marxism neo-marxism, whatever and how I
*  Marxism neo-marxism, whatever and how it is ended at one point with a part of my life and just making me absolutely
*  miserable from another person it was like
*  Why is the person you were dating? Yeah, I was someone I was in a relationship with and it was just like I'm getting assaulted in a way
*  No, I'm not trying to say words of violence
*  Calm down. I
*  Was just under I felt like I was under attack all the time for things that I didn't do and things that I from
*  arguments that I had or
*  Accusations and like I don't understand why I am being
*  This is being offloaded onto me at the time. So I start researching and researching and researching because I truly believe
*  Essentially like like J.S. Mills says though that though that
*  He who understands only one side of the argument not the other understands a little of both and so even through all this
*  I have to read I had to come to the fact that as much as if you'd want to take that shallow
*  Diagnosis of Peterson
*  It's the same as if you want to take a shallow diagnosis of Marxism. Mm-hmm
*  These things aren't operating out of complete falsity. They're not coming out of nowhere. They're not built upon nothing
*  There is truth being said and everything. This is there stemming from truth
*  So that's a good if you read marks, there is true critiques. There's there's true things within it now
*  Where people often go wrong is you know, they take a seed of truth and they plant a forest of bullshit, right?
*  So just because you can you can grow it doesn't mean you're necessarily like I think a bamboo, right?
*  So if you put bamboo and a lot of the places especially in Western
*  Especially the Pacific Northwest or Western America depends on your climate zones. We're not gonna get in all that but a
*  Lot of strains of bamboo will grow to the point that they just
*  They can't be stopped. They will grow through concrete. They will grow through asphalt
*  They were so if you're gonna plant it you have to plant it in like steel boxes and concrete barriers and things
*  They make sure that the bamboo stays only where it's supposed to be
*  Otherwise, it's gonna be fucking everywhere and it's gonna outcompete and dominate everything else now planting the bamboo great idea
*  But if it goes nuts and destroys all your your native
*  flora
*  Well, fuck that wasn't so great. Now what?
*  That wasn't so great now was it right, you know great I hope you like bamboo cuz that's all you fucking got now
*  Yeah, like there's truth in a lot of those philosophies in terms of they have a point
*  Yeah
*  but then when you apply it large scale and then you take into account human nature and how humans find ways to
*  blame others for their own shortcomings and find ways to juke the system and and then you wind up with a mess well
*  it's definitely a problem if you take
*  a
*  Mostly an external look at everything. It's all outside of me. It's all other things. Yeah, it's all these these it's all these systems
*  It's all these other aspects these external
*  processes and it's none of it is me right and none of it is the individual and none of it is you know the small group to
*  the large group to the you know, all these things change from
*  every
*  Vantage point from from the single person to the small tribe to the larger nation nation-sized community
*  I mean to think about the logistics it takes to
*  Keep some of these systems working and working accurately or as accurately as we can at times
*  Something dumb like I don't know just making sure electricity gets to your house. Mm-hmm. It's
*  Enormous right? It's not really think of completely take that for granted a great
*  Micro version of what we're talking about is the Capitol Hill
*  autonomous zone
*  Which turned out to be a fucking disaster so close to home Joe
*  I'm from Ballard. Yeah, and and you know, it's so interesting. It's like, of course it would be on Capitol Hill
*  Yeah, that was like our little hate ashberry of sorts
*  But you know, I thought Capitol Hill had had really jumped the fucking shark a long time ago when I was reading an article about
*  People wanting to be on Capitol Hill so bad that they were willing to live in
*  Shared apart shared shared living space scenarios where they're sharing bathrooms and kitchens and all this and paying like
*  Stupid money for a room and I don't mean a room in a house. I mean purpose-built
*  habitation scenarios to to do that
*  Why the fuck do you want to live there that bad I mean there's plenty of cool shit there
*  But there's plenty of cool shit all over Seattle. What was it about Capitol Hill because I'm not a Seattle guy
*  it was just you know, it was the it was the
*  Gay or LGBT I guess now as you would refer to it epicenter
*  There was a lot of there had some head shop stuff
*  It was just sort of a counterculture district, you know, and I remember as a kid, you know
*  We'd go up there and go to the weird little stores
*  I mean, that'd be the place where you want to buy some like crystals and
*  It would be there but it was a groovy very densely cultural place and
*  You know famous for a lot of things, you know
*  Some things unfortunate like me as a pot are getting killed behind the comet tavern
*  or but also for many many great things too, but it was
*  It would definitely be the place where you would see something like a Chaz pop-up
*  It's just that the the separation from idea to reality was something like a Chaz is
*  And it's always going to be this case. It's always going to be just mountains in between the two, you know
*  the funniest part I think for me is
*  watching that
*  Altercation video with Raz and his his his new police
*  stating where the police now and
*  the guy in being
*  Approached for graffitiing a building
*  Going well, you know, what's up with all the guns and all the white guys got all these guns and this lady who's filming going?
*  Don't don't worry about us having guns. Who cares about guns cops carry guns guns are no big deal. I'm just like whoa
*  You guys are doing exactly what you're complaining about
*  They basically made all the worst aspects of a country they put up a border immediately
*  They kept people from going and they had no medical they had no police
*  Their police was a bunch of thugs if something went wrong, they beat people up attacked him
*  One guy was filming things they didn't like him filming so they jumped him. Yeah beat his ass. Yes
*  And there's a picture afterwards of Raz and the guy then embracing each other which to one side. I'm thinking
*  See, I fucking told you people violence isn't the worst thing in the whole world
*  Like, you know to be perfectly honest violence can bring people a lot closer together than you think, you know
*  We've never trained together, but we know what it's like to train so there's already this inherent
*  Rapport between us and then the rapport between you and anybody that gets on the mat is almost
*  Sussed out immediately because you just cannot you cannot be on them in a situation like that and and be living on persona alone
*  You need to really be who you are and that might be a really great fighter might be a really mediocre one
*  It doesn't really matter. Everybody is
*  Generally twisted
*  Everybody is
*  Generally towards their purest self when put into that kind of scenario. It is the chuck. I can't say his last name
*  Palo Palo Palo palanek. Yeah fight club palanek. He's been on the podcast. He's awesome. I listen to it. He's a
*  Palanek
*  Okay, and he you know the that line about
*  You never know who you are until you've been in a fight like it. Yeah, it's true
*  You really want to know who you are get into a fight
*  Yeah, but but watching that and you know, so the side of me is going to see like perhaps, you know
*  A little bit of fisticuffs could could make things a little better, you know
*  Especially if we're to talk about the law of mutual combat that exists in Washington, right?
*  Which is really I think should be national to be perfectly honest
*  The only thing probably have with that is that like they let people fight out on the street
*  Which you should be aware that if you get KO'd you're gonna might you might die. I know
*  Has to be included in such a law. Yeah, you have to be like look you're taking your life into your own hands
*  Like legitimately if you're doing it out in the dirt
*  But we can't nerf the world that much we just can't it's just not possible and as much as we would love to think about the ideal
*  Scenario for everything you you you can't there's always gonna be that one ten whatever
*  It's it's just not possible and so and then you see Raz in this guy and it's like, oh, it's all good
*  But it's just like well, but what if cops just got to just smack people all the time
*  I mean, that's part of the problem with with police issues in general, right? I mean
*  we can go on about I've seen that, you know, you get the arguments about stats from the FBI and
*  About the
*  shootings and unarmed shootings and all this kind of stuff
*  But they don't have stats for how many times has a cop just beat someone's ass, right?
*  They don't have they don't know, you know, and and it's a lot right and
*  But with the the the the Chaz
*  You this thing that the saddest thing about all this even besides
*  I'll take an argument on this even besides all the fucking property damage and they're just tearing everything up and and obviously loss of life
*  Right. There's there's how many people got killed there at least two, right?
*  I think I'm more seven people died seven. She's having people are dead and
*  And
*  Should we have a drink to those people? Yeah, we should we should absolutely have a drink to those people
*  You have your own whiskey. Yep, the warm aster edition the fuckers have their own whiskey
*  Yeah a few a few but yeah, we can get into my love of whiskey at some point here
*  So seven people die seven people died in Chaz, which is obviously awful
*  That is crazy
*  I didn't know that many but what I guess where I'm going with this on what I think could possibly be the worst of all of
*  this
*  People not learning people not learning that it's not so easy to put societies together
*  Right small or large and even that one it was basically you occupied you you you basically did what everybody
*  Complains about the founding fathers do correct you took over
*  Property and land that was held by other people you conquered a space. Yeah, you can't conquer it
*  Yeah, and you didn't even conquer for very long
*  Yeah
*  Whoa, that's good 115
*  War bringer
*  Mesquite smoked this is good shit, man
*  It is a gold medal winner at the San Francisco International Spirits competition. I always think those people are drunk
*  They don't know what it tastes like
*  It's like because I was
*  Was a judge for high times once for all that's a little different. Yeah, I mean it was a posture
*  I don't know how how guys like I'll see Tony
*  I go how do you how do you go up there and do this whole fucking schtick?
*  If you gave me any of that, I'm done. I can't have a coherent conversation
*  I'd be I would be unable to actually keep track of what the fuck anybody's talking you get accustomed to it
*  I guess yeah, it is marijuana you build up a tolerance, but you there's some rough nights where it doesn't see that
*  What it is is like for working out?
*  I'm
*  Material what what cannabis does is it allows you to have these?
*  Possibilities that you can open these doors or not
*  But they're there like you if you're high like if you've been doing your act and you're doing
*  Stand up four or five nights a week and you're you're really in the groove you're honed and you're not gonna get thrown off by
*  St. By some pot, you know what you're talking about and especially if you smoke pot a lot, but
*  What pot does do is?
*  Is it gets you to these places where you might not have gotten before like you go who the fuck is judging whiskey like what?
*  Why are they what are they doing like and then you'll like off off the cuff on stage?
*  You'll go into this place that maybe you wouldn't have gone into before and you'll find ideas
*  So what I like about it is is it it opens up like a flower?
*  These take these ideas and they spread not always though. Sure
*  You know, it's it's a risky thing. You just never know what's going to come with any sort of yes
*  Alteration to your your mind state. It also makes stand up a little more dangerous
*  So it gets you a little scared and that is also good because it it opens up possibilities
*  And it allows you to stay sharp because you're a little nervous like if you've been doing i've been doing stand up for 31 years
*  You know when I go on stage, it's kind of normal even like last weekend. I did the houston improv. I hadn't done stand up in 90 days
*  But before I went up on stage, I listened to a lot of recordings. I went over my notes
*  I knew what I was doing. It was fun. It was a lot of fun
*  It wasn't terrifying but if I got really high before it would be fucking terrifying, dude
*  It the idea that terrifies the shit out of me. I have material I got all kinds of shit, but but i'm just like whoa
*  That's hilarious a guy who's fought as many times as you afraid to do stand up
*  One of the scariest things I ever did was the first time I ever sang on stage with a band and that was this band nile
*  Death metal band and so i'm friends with them carl. You're the man, but
*  i'm sitting in the audience i'm there with my even with with a
*  my ex my girlfriend at the time and we're at the house of blues in hollywood
*  And he literally goes hey
*  Josh burnett's here this that and the other put get this and they put a spotlight on they go
*  He's gonna come out and help us sing black scenes of vengeance and i'm just like, oh
*  Oh
*  You know, I didn't tell you before here no and so i'm just going no
*  Oh
*  Okay, you know so at some point
*  Uh, yeah, by the way, uh people
*  Fronting a band with a microphone you have an inordinate amount of power be careful about how you flex it
*  So I I go backstage they come grab me i'm just waiting and i'm breaking out into a full sweat
*  All I can think of is that my throat is going to close up and only squeaks
*  And and like weird malice noises are gonna come out
*  I'm just going off fuck
*  And I get up there. I I can't hear myself. I just i'm doing my thing and I get off stage like oh
*  That's pretty good. I'm like
*  I'm just losing my shit and he's like what the I go. I have never been more scared in my entire life
*  He's like what the how are you afraid of being on stage and just singing when people are trying to kill you I go
*  Honestly fighting for my life feels good
*  Like i'm not saying that that is the way most people should have viewed things and and uh, and i'm of the believer that if you're
*  if you enjoy
*  delivering violence
*  if you really
*  Are into it then you also enjoy when violence is brought to you and the escalation that comes from it the feeling of of
*  I don't know. I feel like they're in your best mindset. There's a feeling of power that is derived from it like it
*  uh, I talked to uh,
*  Uh, I got we're going all over the place that you might think we were already high
*  But did you did you always feel like this though? Yes, go into I talked to yes
*  Did you feel like that when your first fight? Yes, how were you when you had your first fight?
*  Uh like actual just fight back when you were the baby face assassin. Oh, my first fight was 19 years old. I was
*  on winter vacation from uh from the university of montana
*  One of my wrestling coaches called me up and amc pancreasian was a legit was a pro gym
*  They had pro fighters and they were out there and I knew of them but you know, this was
*  1996 so this shit was still real, uh
*  like diy sort of there wasn't really a
*  An avenue towards things and these i've talked to to mma people now these like you guys don't get it
*  You don't know what it was like back then and uh
*  My my old wrestling coach he calls him up. He goes. Hey, I know you've been training. I know you're into this
*  There's an open there's an opening uh to fight this guy chris charnos
*  on
*  January whatever it was so it was 11 days
*  All right, uh
*  I go oh chris charnos. Yeah fought in superball. He's pro. Yeah. Yeah, okay
*  When all right 11 days i'll be there and that's it. I just went and I trained with an old martial arts coach of mine
*  um
*  Ran a little bit, you know, I was already training back in montana over at jim harrison's, uh
*  Bushido kong karate, you know rest in peace sensei much love but uh
*  I'm like, well, yeah, cool. I want to fight. That's it. I'm standing in line
*  To to go through the medicals and this other cat
*  He looks at me this this uh
*  Um, his name is also also chris and he fought on that that card and he goes so where do you train man? I go
*  oh
*  I train over montana, but also you know trained a bunch in this like this church basement
*  And he just looks at me. He's like
*  cool
*  Later he tells me he goes I thought you were gonna die. I thought this guy was just gonna annihilate you back in the day
*  There were guys that had no business being in there for sure
*  Yeah, and uh, so I get in the ring. Uh, I fight chris. I choke him unconscious in like two minutes
*  and uh
*  Matt gets in the ring and he goes hey, you know, we'd love to have you come back in the summer and fight again
*  All right. I'll be here and that was just it was just a matter of I was so
*  The funny thing is I was ready to get out there and amp to do it
*  But uh, even then when you get started it felt like my first ever wrestling match to some degree and like everything kind of
*  turned into tunnel vision and it's uh
*  It's a it's a strange strange feeling about how everything seems to be going a million miles an hour
*  And you watch it back in reverse. You're like, oh my god
*  There was actually a lot of time in between, you know segment a to segment b
*  And I do remember my first wrestling match especially because I fucking head and armed this guy who had already placed he had placed in
*  Uh the district so or the city whatever in metro we call it
*  He wrestled for ingram. Uh, I wish I could remember his name. He's a cool cat
*  But I I threw him with a head and arm boom and as i'm pinning him i'm i'm screaming
*  Had you ever screamed before when you're pinning somebody it was my first ever wrestling match i'm just like
*  I get in there
*  Yeah, and I throw him and pit him on his back
*  And I get the pin i'm just like what the fuck was that
*  Everything going a wire keep your shit together. Yeah, you know, um, that's a crazy thing right about life
*  Real real life normal life and then competition
*  Or chaos or you know a fist fight
*  Does there's a thing that's like you enter into a world where all of a sudden the sky looks a different color
*  Your your hands don't move the right way
*  You're you're you hesitate you're thinking too much
*  It's a it's weird to watch people enter into that world for for the first time. I think that part of it
*  Uh, I would say is that we're we're too disconnected from things associated to that state not just danger but just that chaos
*  chaos, too, um
*  As I got more and more and more into philosophy and i'm real
*  Uh really heavily into nicha
*  In fact, that's actually even how I even came across jordan peterson to begin with was I was just looking for lectures on nicha
*  online and this is before any of his his stuff with uh
*  The pronouns and the bills and stuff and no this was just me listening to his university lectures. That's all it was
*  Okay, so you're og. Yeah. Yeah, real og and have you met him never no the nicest guy he once uh, he did
*  Or someone from his twitter, uh reached out to me at one point
*  When his book came out and said hey, we'd like to send you a copy and I go. Yeah, sure no problem
*  And it was signed john
*  So I don't know how the fuck that happened, but I was like
*  In a way, that's kind of better. But whatever so so the guy named john signed it. I don't know no to john
*  Instead of josh. Oh jesus, so I don't fuck. I don't know, you know, I know how that stuff goes but uh,
*  And so i'm sitting there and as someone being so into nicha I started to look at it as this is tapping into
*  Like your highest state of being so to speak. So when i'm in the ring, I feel like
*  Things that are attached to me from modern and general living are removed. I feel like it is the most
*  freeing
*  Alive moment in my life and as I can look back even to that wrestling match even to getting into fist fights as a little
*  Kid like there was always something about me that was drawn to it not just because I wanted to
*  You know conquer and crush skulls, but that I literally
*  Could not get enough of the feeling of aliveness
*  From it and it wasn't just that it was dangerous. It wasn't it's it's beyond that
*  It is I think more akin to like people talking about that that that no mind state
*  And of course if you can operate in that state, well, then you might michael jordan yourself a night and and look amazing
*  But even when that isn't the case if you can you can
*  Center your focus into being in that moment
*  You can experience
*  A type of being that is at its highest level of human existence
*  It's just that it's not something that is I had to learn is not
*  You can't be that way all the time
*  And other people can't relate to you when you're in that state like you just
*  Your ability to communicate with your fellow man just isn't really there unless they're also in that state with you, right?
*  Yeah, it's
*  These moments where you're forced to live in the moment you have to there's no other way around it
*  And everything requires so much attention and so much focus that when you go back to regular life
*  That's the thing that fighters have a really difficult time with yes, and people don't understand
*  Why do they keep coming back and don't they know it's over?
*  Why don't they find other things to do because there's nothing that's going to ring their bell like a fight
*  There's nothing like getting up for a fight knowing that it's around the corner the anticipation you have to you have to build a way
*  Out of fighting so to speak, uh, I believe
*  To try and really simplify it and remember there was that clip just not that long ago of
*  Of mike tyson talking about no longer being a fighter and you know, he's broken into tears like I
*  I was able to watch it once
*  Kind of from afar so to speak but I couldn't watch it again like it i'm like no
*  No, that's that's a hundred percent like I
*  I'm like, oh, I know this way too fucking much you're you're tugging on strings
*  I don't I don't really want to play with right now that I already know of and
*  It's just yeah, uh
*  I don't
*  I don't expect that other people are always going to know what that's like and that's okay
*  when people say that they don't
*  understand my
*  affinity to violence
*  I'm like, okay. Yeah, sure that makes total sense to me. That's you're you're capable of it
*  by the way, all of us are like they're but
*  Not everybody's built the same to do the same things just as much as my
*  Way of abstract thinking if I sit down with eric weinstein
*  He leaves me behind if he takes certain subjects and like, okay
*  Yeah, i'm just going to be along for the ride because I can't my brain can't operate on the same level in this fashion
*  That you can't but you haven't spent time in that realm. Well, yeah and
*  Maybe I could
*  Become a
*  Competent enough in you would have to start all over him. But I start your life over. Yeah
*  Weinstein talks to me about that stuff and i'm like, okay
*  I don't I don't know where you're going with this. I don't even know what you're saying
*  Yeah, but so I it was eric I was talking to because he's always interested for my take on on violence and how violence relates to
*  humanity and how it relates to being and
*  I listened to his podcast his podcast with jaco and
*  I would say I mean it was really great and i've never met jaco, but he sounds like a really awesome dude
*  He's the best i'll connect you guys would love to um, but I
*  But I said to eric I go one of the things that I saw that was kind of different here in the way that both
*  Me and jaco seemed to approach this is that he's so very clinical about it very regimented
*  And I understand that because if he's in a military presence like you can't just have a guy who's you know
*  Soaking himself in the enemy's blood and running around the battlefield screaming at the top of his lungs
*  That doesn't help anyone right like reveling in something like this
*  Isn't really
*  a necessity in anything right that is
*  It's besides the point and in fact in 2020 if anything. Yeah, especially in 2020 when they went after uh,
*  gurkha soldiers nepalese soldiers who were sent on a
*  kill mission and to grab some sort of
*  Extremist and they like well, we need we're gonna have we want proof too
*  So what do they do they pull out their cookery and take the dude's head off and bring it back
*  And then they went and put that guy on trial
*  For doing his job because we thought oh, that's too much too much proof
*  it's it
*  It's death and war and violence. What is too much? You know what I mean?
*  I mean what what if his head had gotten cut off and you know stuck on a pike somewhere to be like don't fuck with
*  Us, I mean the problem is how it appears to people that don't live in that world, right?
*  Yeah, that's the problem
*  Like if you if if a soldier kills someone and then they say we need proof that you killed that person
*  They bring back a head and you go. Hey you fucked up now. Yeah, you brought back his head like well
*  What do you want me to do bring back a picture of him dead?
*  Yeah, that's not good enough. You need the head, correct, correct and and and also I guess to take on uh,
*  A tone that seems to be permeating the the general uh sphere of consciousness in the west
*  Oh, well, who are we to tell gurkas that they're not allowed to cut people's heads off
*  Right, that's their culture. Yeah. Yeah, don't uh, don't don't do this, you know, don't do this. Yeah, the kukri. Yeah
*  Yeah, I I own a uh kukri from cold steel man. And that thing is my my my one of my prized possessions
*  Why do they shape it that way? Uh, I don't know the history of why the blade takes on that shape
*  but I can say that the shape of the blade the way it's designed is
*  One of the greatest chopping devices you will ever come across
*  Because of the the angle in the blade and the way that it it widens out towards the tip
*  It creates this belly of cutting uh pressure that when you swing that fucker, it just whacks right through anything
*  Looks pretty dope. Oh, that's a damascus one. Yeah, mine's a uh, uh old school
*  Uh
*  San my three cold steel that has my logo on it. Uh, you know, thank you
*  Thank you
*  Uh andy and and lind thompson for that one, but uh, it is
*  Arguably one of the baddest fighting knives ever created. It's pretty dope. It will take off pretty much anything
*  Very old school. That's a 19th century
*  There's small ones that they make uh folders and cold steel has a small one called the rajah three and with that same
*  blade design
*  They can just whack through
*  A bunch of uh pork ribs or whatever just take it apart and just boom just explodes it's gone
*  It's a weird shape it but it it's it's interesting. I'm sure i'm sure eric could sit down here
*  Yeah, i'm sure but it's interesting that it was not universally adopted
*  well
*  It has to do with a lot of different things. I mean
*  I'm trying to to go back through my military hand-to-hand fighting
*  Books and stuff like that. Yeah about the samurai blade like the katana or you know
*  It's curved too for being able to cut from horseback. It's a great cutting blade as well
*  But it's interesting that that blade was not recreated by other cultures
*  uh, well similar, uh in
*  Korea they have a similar blade too and there's more uh resembles early
*  style blades called uh
*  tachis, I believe
*  um, and then the chinese have the broadsword and then of course you have so they don't have the exact same design i'll give you that
*  you know with the way that they have designed the
*  the the
*  shape of the edge itself
*  And the way that they they refine their point
*  Uh with that that sort of wedged tip
*  But scimitars are are curved also for their cutting ability and also for when you're on horse if you come by and you swing that
*  That curved blade when it starts to make bite as you're continuing to go through
*  It it transfers that energy across the blade in such a way that it doesn't tear your arm off off your horse
*  Imagine there was a youtube video of every person who ever died by the hand of a sword
*  Just from the beginning of time just chop chop chop chop chop chop chop
*  You'd be like what the fuck that that's part of the problem with seeing things on video
*  Yeah, right
*  Like you don't see all the life that was lived before that moment where someone was chopped
*  You just see the chop you don't see the conversations. You don't see the love think about the ufc
*  Guy goes out there gal goes out there fights loses
*  And then when people take up the the position that oh from this moment on
*  Oh now they they don't matter because it's like whoa whoa whoa, right? That lady just won
*  30 fights in a row and never lost now. She sucks right now. She sucks because she lost a fight
*  Wow, that's the problem with our culture where it is a culture thing
*  Yes
*  People are commenting that have no understanding of what they're commenting on other than the actual act of a knee hitting a chin
*  Like all the people that ragged on ben askren for getting knocked out
*  Fastest ufc knockout by horhey mazabedal. Yes, dude that guy endured it today was the the one year anniversary
*  So i've been paying attention just to comments today
*  Just like god damn, you know ben likes to be
*  Uh a big mouth of sorts and he really loves to rile shit up. Uh, but
*  You know even the better person I don't necessarily even mean better than ben. I just mean the better person as a general
*  Has to look at
*  that which
*  Even if you dislike it
*  Like if you you hate the way ben speaks and what he has to say
*  But that doesn't take away from what he's done. I'm sorry like his body of work stands on its own
*  And you can think him a shitty person or or god's greatest go back and watch this fight with douglas lima
*  Who we were talking about who is one of the best fighters in the world. He ragdolled. Yeah, he ragdolled koroshkov
*  When he was the bellator champion, I mean they had a problem in that his style
*  No one could defeat him and it wasn't fun to watch for people who didn't like mma. Unfortunately ben's finishing
*  capabilities did not
*  uh did not uh grow or did not um
*  It didn't grow to the same level that his wrestling ability was but it did when he went to 1fc
*  It got much better
*  But because they allowed him to do some shit you couldn't do over in bellator like knee a downed opponent in the head
*  Sure, but I mean ben just should have been subbing guys left and right in bellator
*  But he just didn't quite have it now and my opinion always was at least from watching it like if you're
*  This inventive of a funk wrestler in in collegiate wrestling and what have you international wrestling
*  I I know you could be a literal submission machine. It had to be just
*  Approached maybe pressure to just get those get those wins
*  I mean, I mean there is an issue with I think some of the wrestlers coming in and
*  thinking about the
*  The game structure of wrestling and being like, okay
*  Okay
*  So if I win this five minutes then i'll give him the next two minutes and then i'll take three minutes
*  You know, they're thinking about how to win a match, right?
*  Whereas i've never thought like oh, you know, maybe if I
*  I'm like i'm gonna kill him
*  And if someone doesn't come in to stop me, i'm just gonna keep like fuck it
*  You know, and if maybe his corner jumps in then i'm gonna kill him and then i'm gonna just you know
*  It's just like
*  I don't have any friends when i'm in the ring
*  The only people I have are the people that have my back that are in my corner and that's it everybody else is the enemy
*  If they decide to get in front of me and that's the difference between a fighter's mentality and someone's trying to win a match
*  correct and and ben askren is
*  Awesome at he was he's he's been awesome at mma. He was an awesome wrestler
*  It's un it's undisputable another thing to take into consideration for people are ben askren haters ben askren needs a hip replacement
*  And he's needing one for a while and uh, he his hip was pretty fucked up over the last year and a half of his career
*  And uh, I mean, I think he's talking about it now, but he definitely talked about it to me
*  It's fucked. I I have no doubt a lot of these wrestlers colman mark colman got a hip replacement
*  Yeah, john wane par just got a hip replacement. That's all over his he did the uh,
*  He went and elected I guess to get what the shaved. Yeah, which obviously has technique. It's better
*  Uh one of my friends someone you might even used to roll with victor, uh victor webster
*  Yeah, he got uh discs replaced in his back and now he's back on the mats. Yeah eddie bravo got the same thing
*  Exactly he trains with eddie. Yeah, it's fantastic
*  He got a titanium this articulating titanium disc instead of getting his back fused and victor goes
*  I've never felt better. That's amazing
*  Eddie still has pain in his
*  Nothing's nothing's uh, but I think eddie fucked his back up so bad before he got it fixed
*  Could be like he was uh all the edge of the bone itself was getting you know
*  How it frays out and you you develop this extra bone?
*  Because your body's trying to fuse it itself your body's trying to figure out what to do with all this inflammation
*  You know that was the thing about pat milletic pat milletic didn't get his neck fused
*  But it fused itself
*  That's insane, but that body will do what it needs to do
*  The body will do anything it needs to to keep going. Yes
*  Well people actually reported that pat milletic had neck surgery
*  So pat milletic had to spend all this money to get these nr mris done and x-rays to show no
*  No, didn't get any neck surgery because they were saying to some but like why are your discs like that?
*  Well, they fucking fused together from combat
*  Yeah, just the and you know, he's got a lot of atrophy in one of his arms like boss boss rootin has
*  Yeah, that benji raddick had a problem with that at one point too
*  Uh, and luckily he was able to get it sorted out. Uh, yeah boss's right arm is obviously not it's it's best anymore and that's
*  You know fucking around with the spine
*  Uh damaged around the spine is something that we really need to be uh, super aware of but at the same time
*  Something is just it's unavoidable it may happen it may not you
*  Uh always from the beginning of your career you you have always had a love for catch wrestling and catch wrestling
*  Uh, particularly the carl gotch school of catch wrestling was very conditioning heavy. Yes, very strength and conditioning heavy
*  I mean he was a big proponent of clubs. Yes maces. I swing the mace
*  Someone was asking me about you know, do I have weights at my house? I go I have a 22 pound
*  uh
*  mace
*  Uh at my house and people like 22 pounds bro. I'm squatting 450
*  And they yeah, they they would think that that's not a good workout it sounds like uh, oh, yeah
*  Well, what's up with this thing? And i'll tell people like no do not try to swing this thing
*  You're probably gonna blow your elbows out if you don't know what you're doing. Isn't that funny? Yeah, 22 pounds
*  They're like get out of here. Well, if you go look up, uh, yuko miato, uh, there's videos of him swinging clubs and he's
*  Probably 60 something now and he can still pick up a couple clubs and just start kneeling the shit out of them
*  Remember the iron cheek. Yes deep into his career. Yes, those big ass wooden clubs
*  There's a video where iron chic was doing
*  Call outs at some event right? It was like it was a promo thing
*  Hey, you know, whoever the biggest strongest guys are in here coming here
*  See if you can swing these clubs like me and one of the guys that comes up
*  There's the ultimate warrior and he can't and he couldn't fucking swing them. No, man
*  There's that's a very specific kind of strength that you have to develop. Yes, and it's a strength coordination
*  The ability to to move through all the planes of movement
*  uh
*  In fact, I did a whole ton of club and uh mace swinging in preparation to fight frank mir
*  Look at this. This is precious paul and look at precious paul. That guy's a gorilla too. Yeah the size of this motherfucker
*  He can do that, but he's not swinging them. You know what I mean? He's just letting them go back and forth
*  Yeah, the swinging the the shield cast is where it gets different. Yes
*  Yeah, it's much easier to do to sit there and just go back and forth. Yeah, he's like
*  Down with america
*  Yeah, and he's a guy who's really hurting. I look at the ref who's like Jesus man. Don't get bashed on this club
*  Yeah, see the difference between the way he's doing it. That's that shield cast motion. That's a very difficult motion
*  Yeah, if you're into a club and mace swinging there's there's two people that I highly recommend one is jake shannon
*  The other one is greg walsh
*  those two guys are
*  I mean mace swinging club swinging are especially mace swinging for greg are
*  Part and parcel to the entire like a foundational aspect of their training stuff. Yeah, so uh, and they're you know,
*  jake's a catch guy greg's a
*  physical fitness conditioning guy so
*  But I I think the mace is a fantastic tool for building great strength and it's all it's wrestling related
*  It's warrior related didn't carl have some crazy requirements that you had to achieve physically before you were able to train with him
*  Yes, and part of that was also to just keep idiots away
*  Yeah, I was just to keep the dummies away because carl was such a irascible dude, but I
*  meeting carl and getting to train a little bit under carl made me feel like I've I
*  met someone who
*  You know may have been related to me in some way like I felt like this guy was somehow part of my family
*  But I didn't know it for so long and yet I come from part of that that lineage, especially
*  uh
*  And we're sitting there and these japanese reporters have set this whole thing up
*  and
*  They're like here. We're gonna have carl watch you fighting minotauro. All right and get his opinions and just like oh god. All right
*  so carl's watching this thing and he's just
*  I can see he's just he's making comments. He's tearing into it and he's being highly critical. He'd say something he'd look at me
*  He'd smile a little bit. He'd say something and then we're all said and done and the japanese reporters just like
*  You know, they're just losing their shit. They're like, oh god
*  This is not what we expected to happen. There's like oh what's gonna
*  How is this gonna fall apart like this carl just tore this guy?
*  A whole new one over this right and carl looks at me and he goes
*  What I say is that piss you off I looked at him and I went
*  I don't care all I want all all that's important to me is to try and understand what it is
*  From how you see it and see what I can do
*  To take that and be better and and and to take your criticism and your eyes and your experience and the way you see it
*  So that I can use it to make myself a better fighter and he looked at me. He's went
*  and then he just started showing me stuff and he would call me and give me workouts and see how i'm doing and
*  I
*  honestly not being able to spend more time with carl and and even to an extension, you know billy robinson, even though I got to train under him for
*  years and years and years in japan
*  There was never enough time and billy robinson was the guy who worked with sakuraba, right billy robinson worked with sakuraba and all the
*  uwfi
*  fighters and carl is
*  Started with new japan pro wrestling and toni anoki brought him in there to be their head trainer
*  And he's the one that prepped anoki for for ali you can see some of ali's camp
*  Getting real rambunctious and carl just laughing smiling even though he knows that all that anoki's been just handicapped
*  Like oh you can't throw him. You can't put submissions on him. You can't do this. You can't do that
*  So it's crazy that they allowed leg kicks. They didn't think about it. That's so funny
*  They had no idea the way he did it too from his back and from his side great story
*  I'm with victor webster and we're hanging out
*  And he's friends with kinesha norton who is an absolute sweetheart
*  And so ken norton's daughter, so we're hanging out at this coffee shop and kinesha comes by with her friend
*  So me and victor are there and we're talking i'm wearing this t-shirt and it's uh, it's got anoki on or it's yeah
*  it's got anoki on the shirt and uh
*  One of the the friend that comes with kinesha goes
*  That's an interesting shirt i'm like, yeah, I go yeah, um that guy put my dad in the hospital
*  It was one of ollie's daughters. Whoa from those leg kicks. I'm all
*  What's their daughter? I I don't remember I only met her the one time and wow
*  But I know it wasn't leila obviously because you know, she's obviously out in the public all the time
*  but um there and I should say in the public spotlight, but I was just like
*  Yeah, those leg kicks are horrible yes that did happen
*  Yeah, and i'm like actually anoki is one of my my mentors
*  He's worked he's helped train me in professional wrestling and and was part of the reason why I was in new japan pro wrestling
*  It's just such a crazy moment that they decided to actually do that match where ollie is there with boxing gloves on and anoki is
*  kicking him in the legs like
*  What the fuck then?
*  And it was the champ then or no, uh, I don't I don't know
*  I don't know if he was a champ at that point. I'm trying to remember like where he was in his career
*  Like what year was that?
*  Uh, it was in the 70s. I'm pretty sure about that. Yeah, jean lebel was the ref. Wow
*  It's some wild stuff but uh, but you know
*  Interesting enough that was of an era where boxing still knew how dangerous wrestling was
*  Because boxing and wrestling used to be really interconnected to itself and to each other and it wasn't actually until the marquis de queensbury rules where they started
*  They got rid of
*  Kind of make it up as you go. I mean there used to be bouts of pugilism and and back in england or whatever were
*  Okay. Well, yeah, you can headbutt you can do that you do whatever and so they finally set up some sort of
*  structure of rules
*  and then eventually, you know gloves and other things came into play but uh,
*  But even you can go read
*  Things of 76. Oh, he was the reigning wbcwba heavyweight boxing champion
*  That's crazy
*  That's wild
*  now here's the thing if if enoki would have been allowed to
*  Uh to use submissions and all this kind of stuff. It would have been over the match would have been done 107 times. Oh my god
*  Yep
*  Wow
*  Oh, and here's the other thing if enoki didn't
*  If he had worn gloves then he could have punched but what's the point of trying to box with ali, you know, there's no
*  Well, it's amazing that ali absorbed all those leg kicks. Do you remember when cool vinx phillips fought masato?
*  Oh, yes. Yeah
*  There was a time where a guy who was pretty close to the top of his game
*  Vince was like a sliding a little bit. Yeah, but he was still up there pretty close to the top of his game fought
*  Masato and masato just lit his fucking legs up. So stitch was
*  My he used to wrap my hands do my cuts for all my pride stuff everything
*  So I brought stitch with me from the ufc
*  uh
*  And stitch goes yeah
*  He talked to vince he said don't do this like you you should not be in the ring with this guy
*  You're a tough dude, but this is a different story because stitch had trained muay thai in thailand and all kinds of stuff
*  So he's like don't
*  And vince got his fucking femur cracked. Oh my god. Did he really yes, holy shit. Yes from a leg kick. Yes
*  Or or, you know
*  Many leg kicks that at that time masato was the top of the food chain though. Masato was not he was in his prime
*  Yeah, it's like oh well, he's not winning the k1 max like yeah, but he's losing like bocao and andy sourer
*  Yeah, I mean that was they're all in there. They're all killers man killers
*  Like that was a crazy time for that weight class. That's that's those size guys. There were so many murderers
*  I mean that was ramon decker. That was those days
*  God, that was a crazy time. What an amazing thing to see
*  Uh such high level artistry
*  Consistently man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah people don't understand like what k1 had done. Unfortunately, I heard that glory's going
*  Yeah, I heard that too. I mean, it's just so hard to keep any of this shit going right now
*  Not right now. Everything's fucked. Yeah, covid everything's fucked. It's that's such a bummer though, man
*  I I'm such a huge fan of high level kickboxing and muay thai like, you know lion fights
*  I was always like why why are people not watching this? I mean, what do they have to do?
*  It's it's just everybody talks about the ufc and mma like the people that don't like grappling like oh
*  I hate it when they go to the ground. Yeah, I got a solution for you. This shit never goes to the ground
*  How about this watch these guys, but for whatever reason?
*  It never caught on well don't understand
*  I'll at least put some blame on the ufc for even creating an audience that was like
*  I don't like when they go to the ground because look at like the first
*  I don't know
*  Zuffa takes over
*  How long have they been in charge? I don't know
*  2001 2001 so for probably
*  the first 10 years of ufc
*  The highlight stuff around every event around every promotional opportunity around ufc. What is it knockouts?
*  Knockouts knockouts everybody's getting primed to watch for knockouts and yet people are going to the ground and getting choked
*  People are going to ground getting arm barred
*  What are you telling him to like?
*  People were okay with people getting arm barred and choked what they didn't like is like ben askren
*  Beating karsh koff. I mean those kind of fights. Yeah, I mean that's a bit later longer in the tooth
*  But also mma certain later like like everything
*  Eventually goes towards what is incentivized and how you can game it right system is not I mean for me
*  The way I look at them, I go five minute rounds. No, they don't belong it gets too short anymore
*  Like these everybody's too good of an athlete
*  They know how to game the system to go out round by round scoring
*  No, you got to get rid of that. You got to get rid of the five minute round
*  You got to go at least probably six maybe ten
*  Don't you think there's also a problem in incentivizing people to just win because you have a win bonus
*  That's win bonus. I do not like I have said this from the beginning
*  I just don't think it's fair first of all if you're going to do a win bonus
*  You need to do something about the judging
*  Yes
*  100 you need to have a better scoring system and you need to get rid of incompetence and then when you go to other states
*  You need to take control of the situation and accountability to the scoring too. It's in other states
*  It's dire like if you and I don't want to name states
*  But there's been states that we do fights where i'm just going what who watched that fight? Yeah, I hear you
*  How was that? How was this even possible people just get fucking robbed?
*  Yes
*  So if you have win bonuses and you know
*  If a guy comes in and he's getting 50 and then if he wins he gets another 50
*  You stole 50 000 from that guy by giving him incompetent judging
*  Yes, and I don't if you're a fighter
*  You got to do your best to win if that means take the guy down and hump him and and throw enough punches
*  To keep the referee from standing up. That's 50 000 for now add in
*  Oh, yeah, by the way, you lose we can just cut your contract. Yep
*  Yep, and then you have no security. Yep. Yeah, it's crazy. It doesn't you know, that doesn't help anybody really and uh,
*  uh, I would say a better system would be to have
*  Uh a win bonus and a finish bonus and the finish bonus be double the win bonus
*  I think no win bonus or at least look finish bonus sounds great finish bonus sounds great
*  That's just going to entice people to to fight harder
*  But of course I want a fighter to know that if you're you're going to get x amount of dollars
*  This is what you're getting for that fight. It's not you're going to get half that because the judges are idiots, correct?
*  Yeah, no, I feel you there and that's uh
*  a lot of ways
*  The ufc style of of pricing which seems to be kind of the general model for you for mma is that
*  Yeah, you get you get uh, five bucks to fight and five bucks to win for a guy that you might have paid him
*  Eight dollars to just fight. Yeah, you know, so there's where and I I understand the concept of a win bonus is incentivizing
*  But it only incentivizes to win it doesn't incentivize the finish and if the argument is
*  Those guys at the top level guys are trying to fuck. Here's the thing you ever not tried to win
*  No, no, but i'm not that I I know people who tried to
*  Win who just i've i've been in fights with guys who are out there trying to just
*  Win the cards against me
*  I've been in there with guys the cards against you. Well, I mean just like oh I need to win these rounds
*  You know, I if I can't oh this guy seems like he's too tough to take out fuck that
*  Right, just just win the fight and I see it all the time. I deal with it with my own fighters
*  I go you need to make sure that you really put a hurt on this person and make them
*  Make them want to call for god because otherwise if they get a chance
*  They're just going to try and get in control ride this shit out like whoa boy. That was dangerous. Glad I made it through that
*  Okay, cool. Great, man. That's not what anybody paid to go and see and I thought we came here to see who could win
*  Yeah, you know who could finish a fight. I think finish a fight. Yes, I think finish bonuses is not a bad idea
*  But I think it should be a bonus not like half of your fucking purse. I agree
*  It would be better if people well you you pair that together with say
*  More dedicated contracts like so if you're if if i'm running a company, uh
*  Uh, i'm gonna if I hire somebody if I put them on a long-term exclusive deal
*  I do it because I believe in them now there may be ups and downs and what have you and I could make a mistake
*  And i'll just have to take that but I want this this individual to be able to go out there and give me
*  Absolutely everything they have and know that they're they're not going to be punished
*  If they fall short, right and so i'm going to pay them appropriately now on the on the flip side of things
*  I might if i'm running something as big as the ufc. I'm going to just have a lot of
*  One-off deals on the lower levels until I see that person that I think i'm going to invest in this person
*  And that's the thing, you know, there's skin in the game in that investment and there's skin in the game for them
*  And that's where you get
*  Uh, you're going to get the best responses out of people and that's where you're going to get their best efforts and their best energies
*  And sometimes you're going to be wrong, but sometimes isn't isn't all the time
*  I'll take the i'll take the exception to the rule as long as the rule is giving me what I need
*  Mm
*  Yeah, I I would at least like to see
*  Someone come along with an alternative take on how fighters are paid
*  And we haven't really seen that well I look man if if someone wants to put me in the position to do that
*  I'll do it
*  But nobody wants to at the same time nobody wants to create their proper accountability structure for judging
*  either or for
*  you know even for some of these these uh,
*  These athletic commission apparatus for all these things and which is you know when you talk about chas and all these things and about
*  universality
*  Everybody whether they're voting left right middle doesn't matter right everybody however, they fall on any side of any of this shit
*  Everybody knows and I think that part of this this big
*  protest
*  riot at time slash what have you
*  Is that everyone knows that the state a lot of these state and these bureaucratic structures are unaccountable they're not being held accountable
*  and
*  Their ability to affect them to make them accountable is also
*  Minimal if at all if potentially impossible
*  um, and then on top of that
*  What is the what is the thing that you see as the apparatus that you interact with and interacts with you the most and directly?
*  the police
*  um
*  So but what what how do you relate that to athletic commissions athletic commissions are in charge of how judges get trained?
*  How people get licensed how events are run how so all this stuff?
*  So if they fuck up or if these judges do a bad job or the referee is incompetent
*  Someone has to be accountable, right? They're filtered. They're never accountable, right? They're hardly ever made to be accountable
*  that is a good analogy then right because
*  What you're seeing with the justice system when you see when when people who live in the hood
*  See police brutality over and over and over again and nothing ever happens
*  and then finally the world pays attention and it's really interesting how
*  There's been many george floyds, right? Yes, there's been many situations. I mean even the eric garner case in new york, which is
*  equally egregious
*  um
*  In terms of like what the actual crime was it was nothing like george floyd was nothing, you know at worst
*  Give him a ticket, right?
*  Whatever if you have to or you know what maybe try having a conversation with him and just saying like dude, come on
*  Well, the george floyd one too is like a fucking fake 20 bill gets you in a cage
*  And I realized 20 bucks counterfeit bill is a felony
*  Whatever how you gonna prove that the guy did it. I don't know, you know how you prove that he deliberately
*  Yeah, I mean there are count there's counterfeit bills in circulation that nobody knows about somebody gave me a counterfeit hundred once see
*  Yeah, I mean I didn't I just I was looking I was like this seems fucking weird
*  Yeah, and then I I don't remember how I figured out that it was an actual
*  Counterfeit hundred. I don't remember. It was quite a while ago like more than 10 years ago
*  But I remember looking at it like it feels off
*  But they can get pretty goddamn close true and if you're not paying attention and and wasn't george floyd on drugs
*  Yes, I mean they said he was high they say what they say he was on
*  Potentially a variety of drugs, you know
*  So how the fuck is he gonna pay attention to whether or not a bill is legit?
*  I don't know if you whacked out, you know, it's been really interesting to me to see people come out
*  and try to
*  I don't know if they're necessarily trying to justify but they're they're definitely taking the side of trying to demonize george and i'm like
*  because of his previous stuff about like the the home invasion with the
*  Pointing a gun at a pregnant woman's belly and where he's on drugs and what have you and I go
*  You know what?
*  Whether you you don't even realize this but you just made the greatest argument for why he shouldn't be dead
*  because whether you've
*  Done something terrible or you've been the best person ever
*  You need to get the same amount of justice as anybody else equal treatment and equal treatment that you need to be
*  If you if you have to be put into cuffs or anything like that if you have to be brought in
*  Whether you did xyz or you did, you know the nicest thing ever and you just had this one slip up that was real
*  It's has to be the same across the board. That is the great argument that
*  why
*  uh
*  Police have to be held far more accountable than your average citizenry and that means not to just
*  Land a bunch of shit on top of their head and like live up to this, you know dumb fuck
*  No, it's why you need to prepare them and help them and foster them to be able to be capable
*  Like who's ever going to be capable of doing anything if you don't give them the right support? I can't send in
*  Some amateur just started whatever fighter go to go out there and fight ben askren
*  That's never gonna i'm just gonna get them murdered like they're they're not capable
*  But I you know over time maybe I can get them to the position and maybe they'll never be capable
*  Of being able to fight a ben askren or maybe they're not capable of being a police officer
*  But also maybe they're not capable of being a lot of things
*  But there is something that they are capable for but when that leaves the realm of my responsibility then that's a different story
*  Well when jaco was on the podcast and obviously jaco has a deep
*  Level experience at training people in war. I mean in training navy seals training the elite of the elite
*  And he said they should be doing 20% of all their time on the job training 20%
*  I agree because they they train for a few hours when they first get the job and then the rest of their life is
*  Just doing the job. Yes. He's like that's crazy. It is crazy. There should be de-escalation training
*  There should be psychological training coaching
*  You should be able to figure out how to handle a situation and when you see someone who's abusing someone like the other cops that
*  Were around step in do something step in, you know
*  If a cop needs to put knees on necks for seven minutes on anyone you're hearing incompetent
*  I'm and the thing is it's not as if I can't understand and be sympathetic for how difficult a job that must be
*  Okay
*  But there is no way to have a rule of law society and proxy out your violence to another apparatus
*  Instead of you doing it yourself
*  Without that apparatus
*  Fighting handicapped all the time. It's just it's just the way it has to be, you know, the dude that
*  Freaked out at the he was he was getting arrested and he was drunk at his car and what have you and then he finds out
*  He's gonna he's actually gonna go be taken in for for this dui like oh shit steal the taser and what?
*  Okay, I get all that but as soon as he you fucked up and he got away and his back's to you can't shoot him
*  Sorry, you just can't shoot him
*  Well, I think their point is that he was shooting the taser while he was turned around and when they shot him
*  He was pointing the taser at them. Yeah, that's why you're shooting him in the back
*  I get it. And but it was what two cops?
*  How many cops are there? I believe there was two cops. I don't know you got a partner. Yeah, sorry
*  You gotta trust him. Don't blow up. Don't blast this dude in the back
*  Even when he shoots his fucking the taser that he stole off you eventually you got his car
*  You know who the fuck he is
*  You'll just have to show up and be like man
*  I know this is real bad and i'm sorry that it's real bad and i'm sure you never intended it for me to be this real bad
*  But we got to do something someone had a real good point that you shouldn't call the police for something like that in the first place
*  Because the person is drunk and they're asleep in their car and there should be someone you can call
*  That where that person knows they're not going to get arrested someone's gonna get you an uber. We're good
*  You're all right. Look at how much that's another part of this whole thing and that this all this falls into all of this stuff
*  We need that we're constantly calling on the police to do fucking everything
*  No one wants to just be responsible for their own life. They don't want to take the agency of protecting their own things
*  Standing up being who they being their own agent in the world
*  They always want like oh shit something happens call this person call that person always you got a problem with someone at work
*  Sit down have a conversation with them. No, no, fuck that call hr. Call this sue this person
*  It's always everybody wants to to to med out
*  Their responsibilities to something else. Well, the system is structured that way
*  I mean if you were in an office and you have a dispute with someone and you sit down and want to talk to them person
*  A person you're putting yourself in a handicap
*  If you have a real dispute with a person like say if someone did something to you that you found questionable or against the rules
*  Like you have you're incentivized to contact hr. Yeah, they they really push that you're right. You're right joe and and that is
*  That's bureaucracy for you. Bureaucracy will always grow don't get a job. That's what I say to people. Yeah
*  Someone needs to do those jobs, but it shouldn't be you. Yeah. Well get out of there
*  I'm not in the nine to five for a good reason. I've worked in uh, uh
*  environments of that nature with hrs and all that kind of stuff working in tech and doing other things and i've done sales i've done
*  Menial stuff you're not structured for that. No, i'm not. I had a real uh, I had some struggles with it
*  I really did most people aren't meaning you you neuter a person when you make them work in those environments man or woman
*  It's not natural. No, it's not natural. It's not natural to like
*  It's I mean
*  Cooperative ventures are fantastic as long as the cooperation is is mutually beneficial and natural correct
*  Like if you have two good friends and you're like, hey man, let's start a fucking motorcycle company together
*  Let's make motorcycles and you're like, yeah, let's do it and then you're doing it together and you're enjoying it
*  And you like you yeah, there's problems, but you enjoy
*  Communicating and working together if you you're a person you want to make a living you have to join a cooperative venture that you know
*  You're you're in an office with people that you might not ever
*  Hang out with in real life and then when you get in coffee some creepy fuck says some weird shit about your ass
*  And you're like god damn it and you're a woman you have to deal with this like you walking out to your car
*  And he's asking you to go to dinner with him or something. You're like, this is bullshit
*  This is not what I signed up for right? I just want to make a living like I get it from all
*  Points of view but at the same time you would like to be able to think that if you can just go and say hey
*  I'm not interested
*  I would like that but if I was a woman, I would never believe that guys are disgusting guys are pretty
*  And there's so many weak guys
*  There's so many weak guys that would when a woman well like I was reading this thing about the unibomber about um
*  one of the things that happened with the unibomber when with his brother the brother had
*  He had to chastise the unibomber because the unibomber
*  When ted kaczynski he had this issue with a woman where he was interested in her and she wasn't interested in him
*  And when she wasn't interested in him anymore
*  He started leaving all these fucked up notes for her saying horrible shit to her and the brother had it like
*  Like that's real with men and for a woman that shit's scary
*  See like for a man it's scary like oh this bitch is gonna slash my tires or she's gonna say I raped her
*  She's gonna make up a story about me. I can get I can get fired. I can get arrested
*  That's scary for men, right? Yeah, but for a woman they have to worry about their actual life. It's another level of scary more
*  Peterson's already laid this out men men are more
*  Agents of of physical violence and action than women are women are more
*  character assassination
*  Like that, yeah, which completely makes sense
*  But you know now you you shove them in this environment together and they say like
*  Now don't allow anything to go sideways, right?
*  You know, it's hard enough for men and women to try and figure out how to interact with each other in a space to even
*  Get in each other's pants to create anything of value. I mean, it's just not easy, right?
*  And then you have office like people actually do wind up dating. Yes, which is fucking crazy
*  I mean, it's it's really typical though, right? So it's like, uh, you're working together so many
*  Or look at gyms. Oh, yeah
*  Jesus oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah, and then you're also dealing with like emotionally damaged people for the most part
*  I mean half of the people that are fighters are fucked up like the fighters are an interesting, uh,
*  They keep it together through fighting and through I mean, it's not like they chose to be fucked up
*  A lot of them are fucked up through physical and sexual abuse
*  And that's what led them to fighting in the first place to to try to exercise some of those demons
*  And then you have them involved in relationships with each other and they're training together
*  And then there's other guys around and there's other girls around and then this it's fucking madness
*  there was some studies or there was at least something about how
*  People were getting really into doing yoga and now all of a sudden all these people in yoga studies are fucking each other like mad
*  And so and they're like well what's happening is these people are getting into better shape their testosterone is going up
*  All these different things are happening. I'm like to me. I just thought oh so you started being more towards a more natural
*  state of being you know being physical being active being now I understand that this is in a very
*  controlled
*  Uh procedural environment. It's not like you're running around trying to get an elk because if you don't your tribe's gonna die
*  But you people need to be active. They just need to also in yoga. It's very sexual. I mean there is a big sexual you
*  Aspect to yoga there are some sex related and then there's yeah you get those those those
*  those tights that are made to like
*  Lift and separate the butt cheeks and all this stuff and besides that there's just an intimacy in the fact that you're struggling together
*  Like you've overcome this thing together exactly and then you want to go out to lunch. I look at that
*  Look at that with martial arts training sure you guys are struggling together you're overcoming together
*  You're both facing adversity the same adversity and dealing with it in your own ways
*  Yeah, and that creates camaraderie. It really does it and it can create an intense
*  rapport, but that doesn't necessarily mean even that that can
*  be sufficient or
*  That that relationship can then go towards something more long-term and firm
*  Right, which you know we we get we're so great at lying to ourselves and fooling ourselves all the time
*  like oh i'm so intense with this person and
*  You know, oh we we hooked up and this and that and uh, and then you start getting together and then it's
*  It's a shit show
*  you know, uh
*  because you thought that just because
*  You guys had this one metric at which you guys were both very intense that that would cover for everything else and it's like
*  Well, no, that's not how relationships are built and that's how humans have a lot of fucking
*  Things that need to be checked a lot of boxes
*  Hey, there's a great website or a great youtube that I send
*  all of my friends and and and all of my fighters for sure called academy of ideas and this dude has these
*  awesome lectures on
*  All kinds of things dealing with with life and current climate stuff and all these different things but all dealing
*  taking pieces and building these lectures around uh philosophers and and uh, and and
*  Throughout historical uh, historically, uh correct lens or not historically correct
*  but uh, you know going through papers and and and pieces by all these people throughout time and it's it's been
*  Uh really, you know things like that. I mean we we need or things to help us with orientation in such an
*  absurd world
*  and we take for granted that things are just microphones and cameras and I don't know how many
*  tens of people are going to watch this because I'm on the show, but uh,
*  You know, uh
*  Like I I have this whiskey, right?
*  I I love the shit out of it, but i'm not making a whiskey to be a celebrity with a product
*  You know, otherwise i'd have vodka because that's just who gives a shit and quality thing
*  Is the vodka the move vodka is always the move because it's bullshit because vodka is just supposed to be odorless tasteless
*  Grain neutral grain alcohol. That's a good bullshit
*  And so you want to make your stupid vodka so you can be at bottle service and idiots are like i'm gonna i'm gonna buy this vodka
*  It's like I could get vodka for 14. It's just as good as that like who gives a fuck
*  Well, you could take vodka that's cheap and put it through a bunch of filters
*  They put them through water filters and apparently you can make it taste really good
*  Look unless shout out to all the shysters unless it's
*  Depending on whether it's made from wheat or potato
*  Or triticale whatever right like the grain base maybe might influence some of it, but the
*  standard definition for making vodka in the united states is
*  odorless
*  tasteless
*  distilled at uh over a hundred up to 180 proof
*  I mean, come on
*  You're not going to get that much different
*  The only way that you could really fuck that up is if you really don't care about
*  The process of fermentation that much you're just trying to get the product through
*  And you're not that concerned with the source of ingredients
*  So what is it it's like a name brand thing where people really get into like teetos or something like that
*  Yeah, well, you know about the name. I would say
*  Research rini gerard and mimetic desire for that kind of thing. So you see
*  uh somebody else is like well, I have to have the you know,
*  Celebrity vodka a because what have you and someone else goes? Oh, oh they like celebrity vodka a well
*  If they like celebrity vodka a celebrity vodka a must be the vodka to buy and someone else sees that and then so on
*  And so forth and now people like we have to have celebrity vodka a because it's what the other people like
*  I remember p diddy had a vodka right syracuse syracuse. It's still around his shit though, right?
*  It's it's whatever like whether why am I going to pay for it? Yeah, or I want to look cool. I could but I could buy
*  I could buy pretty much any low low tier regular vodka and be just as much out of it
*  as any
*  Right, but you're josh barnett if you're a knucklehead that's getting bottle service to impress the ladies
*  You want to get something that's got a name brand?
*  Right, you want to drive a mercedes?
*  It is a wear an armani now. That's a matter of are you looking for external validation or own personal validation?
*  Is the job is the job to to get a bunch of people?
*  uh
*  So that they're all partying with you or is the job for them to seem as though you're specifically cooler because of the type
*  Of vodka you have isn't it funny that the commercials that attract people to those particular products show
*  These sort of superficial relationships. They show someone popping the bottle
*  They show all the other people looking at them. Everybody looks like they've got a bunch of money. Yes
*  Yeah, yes all that. Yeah, they're building this this this archetype
*  uh this idealization, but i'd say part of the problem with that is the idealize the the ideal that they're pitching is a really
*  Vapid one right it has to do with like
*  Okay, they're wearing an expensive suit or they have like
*  money doesn't doesn't
*  Give you any idea about the character of the person or the things right the value of it, you know
*  Part of before I got into bed with these guys to to start making whiskey with them
*  I said well, I got to be there to come and drink it
*  You know, i'm not i'm not going to put my name on anything that I don't
*  That I don't like and then i'm not into period design it based on what you enjoy
*  Well, they had a mesquite smoked
*  Uh bourbon on the market called warbringer and I came up and they listen to this folks
*  Ah, it's legit. This is a an actual 19th century, uh bourbon bottle design too
*  so, uh
*  I came up there to drink that I drank their hey school
*  I came up there to try basically all the stuff that they had and I got to drink the the
*  This rum that we're working on straight out of the barrel
*  Was fucking unreal and from that I go. Okay, we got something here and then I drink even their their vodkas are the infusions
*  They were doing with them
*  Uh, is that a chicken killing another chicken a chicken killing another chicken?
*  It is it is it is a blood oath level battle right there
*  And I got talking to the head distiller david, uh
*  About my tastes in whiskey and what I was looking to do and we were already on the same path. And so
*  a single barrel, um
*  cask strength
*  This is batch two, uh, which has like a big dark chocolate note to it and like a cherry finish
*  How do you make a dark chocolate cherry finished note? Well for one the ingredients, you know
*  I'm not smelling any chocolate. I don't taste any chocolate. You don't talk. You don't taste chocolate
*  I smell the smoke for sure. Oh for sure, but
*  Even knows and I can smell that dark chocolate element that more bitter side of things
*  I think i'm too stupid for that stuff
*  No, I just think it's about like when people do like when they do wine
*  I've been to a wine tasting before and they swoon around like this is um, I have very oaky
*  I taste the tannins and i'm like, well, here's the thing is thinking so one of one of the people a part of this company
*  Uh cat she's a whiskey sommelier. So when I when we asked for notes from her
*  I'm like, oh fuck. I am just blown away about all this stuff and I'll smell like
*  Yeah, I get yeah, I can kind of see I can see that. Oh, you're right there. Yeah, exactly. But uh,
*  uh
*  but ultimately
*  You gotta just like it, you know, you smell what you smell you relate it to the things that you can relate it to
*  Working at restaurants for a long time we had to do wine tastings and one of the times the
*  Note they told us to look for was cat piss
*  In the wine
*  And i've never forgotten. I think about it every time someone mentions it. That's an ohio thing, bro
*  I'm sure someone's gonna be like, yeah, that's it's a high quality pure grade cat piss right here flavor of it
*  I'm, I don't know the smell the ammonia. I have no idea but like it's always stuck on
*  That is the number one problem with having cats man. They fucking piss on everything else
*  If you don't clean the box, they'll piss in your couch. I've never had a cat that lived indoors really never no
*  Oh my god, my cats always go outdoors. Those are murderers
*  I know cats that go outside of the most ruthless animals. That's the only kind of cat i've ever had they are responsible for
*  in the bees
*  Billions people don't know this if they have cats
*  And they think the cats are cute and they're adorable. They are they are adorable, but they're responsible for billions of
*  Mammals and billions of birds. Yes in the united states every year
*  Yeah
*  Can be eerily similar to another odor which you find often come in contact wow
*  How okay, let's say it does have a cat pee note. How is that gonna encourage people to want to drink it?
*  What are you in the mood for you know, I think cat pee would go with this steak right now cat's pee tim aiken master of wine
*  Scatological tasting terms are comparatively great burgundy smells of shit. What the fuck man. It's very weird. It's very it gets really weird
*  That's how you know, you've lost the plot like you got so far that somebody goes. You know, what? How do I
*  Fuck i'm just sound like everybody else right now. How do I turn this up a notch? You know what i'm looking for this this smells like
*  Specific like bangkok street food diarrhea
*  Very specific this smells like uh, you know a week old yeast infection. I'm looking at a porta potty from the 80s
*  at a guns and roses concert
*  This smells like uh, this smells like a payphone that's been in uh, uh
*  uh
*  Skid row in la for the last 10 years payphones those used to be a thing. I do have a description though
*  So i'm we're in china me and this fighter alissa
*  And I got alissa, uh, uh this fight in in china prior to this whole
*  Tour I had set up
*  um
*  so um
*  Alissa Garcia is a 105 pound fighter of mine, but I got her this fight at 115 in china
*  then I was shipping her to go train with uh
*  Um sentient noi
*  His tai boxing gym that's john wane pars coach
*  And then she was going to then fly back to tokyo finish her camp
*  I was going to meet her and then she fights in rising or no she fought in deep
*  So we're over there and we're being taken out to this big fancy dinner ahead of the event and the promoters there
*  We're in shanghai. It's all this big deal at this private room and i'm like, yeah, you know
*  I had some chinese wine once it was it was awesome, you know
*  I'm down to drink whatever you guys want to drink. He's like I got the best stuff for you. You just wait
*  All right. Fuck. Yeah
*  So we got these tiny little glasses
*  And what they're pouring in it is this stuff called uh, baizhu this chinese wine and uh, or this chinese fermented, uh, liquor
*  And i'm like, oh well, that's that's got a nose on it and I I drank it. I'm just like
*  uh, what the
*  And I but it's the kind of thing that this is probably a pretty it isn't real expensive when they're telling me and they just
*  Keep pouring ones and at some point alissa goes dude. I can smell that shit from here. Why do you keep drinking?
*  They go do you think i'm gonna be the guy
*  To turn over and be like yeah, this sucks. I hate it, you know, uh
*  Two on your fucking fancy want your fancy booze and she goes what's it taste like I go. Okay
*  This tastes like an old abandoned home that has been rained on for years
*  And what you've done now is all this water has leaked through onto the floorboards
*  These dirty floorboards have been pissed on and dead cats are on all this kind of stuff
*  And it's all gone through these floorboards and then it's and this water has been collected and it's been filtered out through a hobo's sock
*  You know, that's what this shit tastes like and she goes what the fuck man. I go do you want one?
*  Like why would I ever do that know what it's like I would take it
*  Pour me one of them babies. Oh, how do we get that stuff here? Oh, it's here. It's here
*  You want me to bring some bijou? We're gonna we're gonna drink some bijou together. Oh man next time
*  We're gonna set it up. I need to know oh man. It'll probably happen in texas. It's brutal
*  I've heard people describe it as it tastes like something you run you like clean a carburetor with
*  It's it's fermented
*  Sorghum and other stuff
*  It's there's some weird tastes that like cultures
*  Sort of have like almost rituals with like for uh, iceland they're into that fermented shark
*  Bourdain told me was the single most disgusting food he ever ate
*  I remember being on tour in japan for new japan pro wrestling and having so it's pretty common that as you go from town to town
*  you would then go out and
*  Uh
*  You'd be taken out by sponsors for the town the local sponsors or maybe whoever put the event on
*  What have you and so I'd get taken out to these restaurants and they would always order stuff like
*  Cow intestines there's four different types that are raw or this or that and they're always
*  I figure what they're trying to do is like test me like see if you fucking eat this see if
*  Does mikey like it or what?
*  and so
*  Uh, yeah, you're probably the only person laughing at that one. I know
*  Cereal
*  And so from the 80s. I remember being given something called chanja, which is a korean dish actually
*  um, it's raw fish guts in a fermented like a
*  spicy
*  Soy paste now the spicy soy paste on its own is as actually it's pretty good and they use it a lot of different stuff
*  uh might be considered gochujang i'm not sure but
*  But you know, it's raw fish guts and so they bring this shit out and they're like here eat this
*  i'm
*  Fuck
*  So i'm i'm like, but I ain't no bitch. So I started eating this stuff
*  And they're looking at me
*  Do you like it
*  No
*  But you know, I have to try it
*  And my whole the whole time i'm just thinking about this tastes like bait this tastes like whatever it was
*  We were using to catch salmon growing up. This tastes like fucking bait and I I can't eat salmon egg either
*  Like it's just too briny salty
*  Uh, that's a weird one, right? But i'm an egg. Yeah, it's just super but I realized that that at least in this case
*  japanese people's palate is
*  More accustomed to these kind of uh, really powerful
*  um
*  You know something even similar across the board
*  So a friend of mine is a ludo chef ludo and I we used to go to his his ludo bites events
*  and so I went to this one with my buddy and uh
*  He we we get this uni
*  Something it was like lobster uni, whatever and I love sea urchin. It was so
*  Sea briny what it was just it was just the first bite me and my buddy, uh, uh tomo
*  We go. Oh, that's not so bad second bite. It's like, okay now
*  We're already reaching maximum saturation on this third bite. It's like we can't fucking do it anymore
*  And um, it was just it was just overpowering us like our taste buds just couldn't handle it
*  It wasn't that I would sit there and say that um that uni is bad. It's just that I
*  Couldn't enjoy it. Like it was just too much for me and I tell ludo and he goes well
*  We have a huge asian clientele that loves to come to these ludo bites and they love the uni derived stuff
*  I go. It must be just you know, a palate thing. It really must because I just I can't I can't handle it
*  Yeah, the uni is a weird one like uh, my kids are into a lot of weird food. They'll try everything
*  They love sushi. They they've eaten wild game since they were babies
*  But uh, I can't get them to eat sea urchin
*  They think it's disgusting. They just stomp around with with like big giant fixed blade knives everywhere
*  Like bracelets what am I in they're pretty normal with a girl piece of el jerky hanging out of their mouth
*  But they like to freak their friends out like my daughter. Um, when she was 10 her friends like what's your favorite food?
*  She goes I like bear. I like to eat bear. They're like what?
*  They're like looking at her like you serious. She's like, yeah, you ever have bear sausage. It's amazing. My dad makes bear candy
*  And they're they're like they don't know what to do, you know average kids never gonna eat bear the whole life
*  I've only had bear once and I did like it. What I had it was uh,
*  I've never had grizzly, but i've had a lot of black bear. I have no idea what kind of bear this was
*  I'm not too hip to the bear population or bear bear genie
*  genus of
*  Far east russia
*  I was in a banya, uh, which is a very communal thing in russia
*  and uh, so i'm in kabarovsk
*  up in the the the
*  far eastern north where it's negative
*  30 degrees below at night
*  And i'm up there. We're in this banya
*  And they have a banya a banya is uh, it's basically just like a big sauna
*  and so but there's it's a traditional setup where they have a
*  an oven with rocks and stone
*  and uh, it's a
*  They will put throw water over the stones and things like that. It's not it's not exactly
*  it's not a dry one like a finish but
*  It's it's a similar to any other sort of sauna setups as you can come across but it's not a steam room
*  and that's also famous for
*  They have a process where they take these
*  bundles of
*  Tree branches with leaves and everything on them and
*  They'll use white oak
*  Eucalyptus other and put blends together and what they'll do is they'll take these two bundles
*  They'll whip the air around you as you're sitting there
*  They they whack your body with it and the these leaves these bundles are made of of mostly fresh
*  So they're still oils. They're still
*  Um, you know live or there's still elements within it
*  It's not fully dried out or anything like that
*  And so this thing is all being hit upon you and they'll hit your feet and they'll do all this kind of stuff
*  To be honest. So the first time I ever went through this this guy is like
*  Beating my ass with these things and i'm just like, okay, I can get through this. I can get through
*  I know this has got to be healthy. You know, i've i've read the wikipedia. It sounds all great
*  And i'm sitting there and you go through sessions like three minute sessions or whatever and and i'm on the third one
*  Which is like towards the end and he's he's he's whacking away and he's whipping these things around me and circulating all this super hot air
*  And I swear to god my pale ass
*  sensitive white boy skin was just felt like it was on
*  Fucking fire and to the point that I started i'm like I got I got I can't do the name
*  and so I get up and i'm i'm i'm
*  yelling in japanese in russia and jumping into a cold pool because i'm
*  I i'm so fucked up from getting my ass beat by this little russian guy with a pile of sticks. Why japanese?
*  I don't fucking know
*  I have no idea and i'm sitting here cooling off so much time in japan that like what the
*  Do you not know any russian?
*  No, I don't I don't know for another language that you barely know
*  I just my brain was in a different place dude
*  And as you can relate when when you're sitting in those things and it's pretty fucking hot and you're trying to get through it
*  Like sometimes you're just trying to get past it. I would imagine the beating from the sticks is like the next level
*  Right because it's frustrating enough just dealing with the heat. Well think about right
*  So you're sitting still and you're having maybe you're having a tough sauna session. You're like, okay
*  If I don't move enough i'll get through this right now. This motherfucker is is pretending to be a fucking helicopter
*  Spinning around the room. He's like a biancé fucking dance number
*  Getting all this hot air blowing all over you like flying like
*  Caressing it up your taint all this shit. It's like
*  Dude, there's no way of stopping this
*  Do you have towels or no towels?
*  Uh, yeah, yeah, you either or man, so you're lying face down basically
*  So naked yeah, basically naked and having he's hitting your taint with this stastering. He's hitting your whole body
*  Very rare that a man hits your taint with sticks very rare
*  I can say that it has habits
*  It's got its enjoyable minutes. Yeah, there's something to it, you know
*  taint often
*  Really neglected part of the human body
*  Uh, i'm gonna start the whole uh, the whole taint, uh specific movement
*  Around how you need to massage and stretch the taint and you have to uh, you know
*  I bet your taint is all locked up. I bet the fascia around your taint is just is keeping you from being able to kick properly
*  Yeah, so this guy so anyways, I get through all this
*  And they have a phone that goes right to the the office
*  And they have a menu and all this kind of stuff and people will bring food as well and usually like samogon
*  Which is russian moonshine, which is it's essentially like vodka type stuff. So they get hammered. Oh, it's fucking great. It's
*  Beautiful. I love it. And so pull up this menu all in like cyrillic russian. So
*  Fuck I don't know what any of this is and so i'm just sitting here like google translate
*  You're trying to get this thing like I I don't know anything. I can't get any communicate cell phone service out there. Uh,
*  Well, I download the the languages that I need
*  When i'm in countries just in case that's the problem so I can get translation you use android
*  I do is that is that better for that? I think google I couldn't say one of the I think google translate works better on android phones
*  I believe I mean perhaps you have a pixel. Uh, no, I have uh samsung
*  The what is this one galaxy galaxy s9 edge?
*  Uh x23
*  It's basically elon musk's next child's name. How come you haven't switched over to iphone you're resisting
*  No, no, never not gonna do it. I knew it. That's what that noise you also drive a manual transmission
*  I should tell everybody this yeah, I drive a six-speed car. Yeah
*  No, I uh, you're part of the resistance
*  Yeah, hashtag
*  Uh, it basically came down to the fact that uh apple is too much in charge of your your your hardware and your software
*  The the minute the iphone came out. I was like cool phone
*  But you're telling me I gotta pay you more money to expand my my memory or my storage capacity
*  When I have a fucking memory card
*  Do you think that I don't know if that exists go fuck yourself jobs?
*  I know I know you you're on this but it's like I feel like joey pence in the matrix when he's eating the steak
*  He's like I want to be an important person over here
*  Yeah, he's willing to be in the matrix and know he's in the matrix as long as he gets a good experience
*  That's how i've i've gone android and I have an android. I have a galaxy. Um, uh note you were a pixel guy, too
*  Yeah, yeah, did you like your pixel? They're good. Okay. They're good. The problem is airdrop
*  The airdrop's an issue like airdrop's amazing and then the walled garden of apple like all my apps work together my notes
*  My notes sync up and I use other note applications so that I can sync them up with my android phone
*  But the reality is the experience in ios is better
*  Uh, you know, I i'm not here to say that uh the apple
*  Isn't creating things that are worthwhile to a degree. It's just that I
*  I refuse to spend that kind of money to have a phone. I just won't do it. This is an s9
*  I mean this thing is still good three years old. It works. It's great. I get it. But here's my thought I was like am I
*  Just by trying to be a rebel
*  Am I having an inferior experience?
*  So I had to sit and think about it and I realized I was I have an ipod touch
*  Oh, congratulations because the only that besides that
*  And itunes you bring to a museum
*  I have no interest in having any apple
*  Products really I just I don't need them. Um, I use a laptop. That's a windows laptop though
*  I use windows everything. Yeah, of course you do. Yeah, you're a rebel. Well, I also I mean I remember when
*  Having to and i've had computers in my household since I don't know when i'm not like
*  not like some super programming geek or anything like that, but
*  I
*  Remember what it was like you had to operate things you had to learn how to use dos and other operating systems before that or using
*  Uh unix type based stuff to get on the internet and do things
*  from the library back in the day so
*  For me, I just want the ability to to get what I need
*  And to have the amount proper amount of storage is necessary and then that's it my phone isn't for
*  Holding music on it. It's not for it's I have spotify which by the way
*  I've just took over what used to be the adrenaline workout spotify playlist
*  And now it is the war masters workout
*  So I put together 96 97 songs for this playlist for people to just go absolutely fucking ape shit in the gym
*  And uh and get their shit done and so part of my spotify deal. I am putting together spotify workouts
*  Oh, yeah, I have a cookout workout or a cookout playlist. I have a workout playlist
*  I have I have a bunch of different plays. Yes driving playlist. Nice. Nice. Yeah, uh, so I I now you have the warmaster's workout
*  so if you guys are out there and you want to be fueled by the
*  the
*  incredibly powerful
*  Thing that is metal if you want to get some serious gains
*  That's it yes
*  We got a monomar we got behemoth we got bolt thrower we got dissection. Oh my goodness. There it is
*  Yeah, there's me from the every time I die show
*  He balances some do you fucking that guy's like over 200 pounds I threw I threw people
*  Oh, it doesn't end. I threw like 50 people off the stage that night
*  My buddy to the right that's andy williams. He's in aew as a pro wrestler right now as well
*  Uh, you see, you know keith all the every time my guy guys keith's up there just like don't crush me while i'm up here trying to sing
*  There's this chick who must have been
*  This tiny little blonde thing who maybe weighed
*  110 pounds at on her best day who?
*  I chucked her once and she comes back. She goes i'm gonna do it while holding this beer the whole fucking time
*  And I meant mind you it was a can but still
*  There's a I have a picture that I got from someone where she's launched into the air
*  He'll has her beer
*  She lands on the crowd and when she comes back to backstage, she goes. Yeah, I didn't spill it. That's hilarious fucking champ
*  But the only way it'd have to be a can like you wouldn't throw her the glass would you no, uh,
*  No, because the the risk is too much. The risk is too much, but there's moments where you like
*  Like
*  Throw her with the glass, you know, no risk no reward man, maybe a shot glass
*  I'll throw someone with a shot glass right because the shot glass is hard to break. It's pretty hard to break
*  Yeah, but a beer like a regular beer glass. That's oh that thing would shatter pretty easy. Then it's just
*  In a pit man, that's bad news bad fucking news
*  Uh, but yeah, so i've taken over this spotify playlist. In fact, you know, i've been a really busy little fucker come
*  Uh covid people are like, oh man, how you doing?
*  Busy as shit. Well, that's good. I launched a new website
*  josh barnett.com is up and running
*  Um, we got the spotify takeover that I just did where i'm running this war masters workout playlist
*  We got the whiskey stuff. We have more whiskey projects in in the the works as well as rum
*  We have our vodka of all things although that's a sign of a man who adapts
*  And and you know, there's a challenge with I came on here a long time ago and I said
*  Life gives you the opportunity to grow in as many ways as you want to choose to
*  Right, you can you do you weren't you didn't come out of the womb and just start shooting arrows
*  You it was something you decided you wanted to do and as you went through life, you know
*  Joe rogan's journey brought him to all these different things
*  And from those he acquired new things new new endeavors, but all these things required growth required
*  Having to suck or whatever or deal with new things to begin with
*  I'm learning how to distill my our head distillers like I want you running these runs from front
*  I want you to learn how to do this from start to finish
*  So you you're part of the entire process i'm becoming a part of the entire process
*  So even with this talking through that so how does this stuff it started off with so we we talked about what we were going to do
*  As far as a whiskey was concerned and what we wanted it to resemble and by the way, it's mesquite smoked because
*  This place is an oxnard. This is a southwest derived
*  Variant on what you might think of even as like isla scotches, which is peat smoked. Well, we we use mesquite
*  Because that's mesquite found in the southwest and we finish it in sherry cask
*  So, uh to give it that sweetness. What do you start with like we start with first day of work. Yeah, you would take
*  grits corn and
*  Grits corn grits corn
*  What is the difference between grits corn the way that the quality of the corn kernels itself and the way they're cut
*  To begin with the way they're initially milled which leaves them all in and and big kernels
*  But it exposes the sugars in such a way that when we go and we put it out there in the smoker
*  That all this this this kernel of corn
*  Gets hit the smoke hits all of it and brings all these sugars to the surface
*  So you start off with the grits corn and then before anything happens it goes into smoke it. Yeah, we smoke what kind of smoker?
*  uh, it's
*  something that he david who
*  This guy I i'm not entirely sure if he has four phd's or at least multiple phd's and multiple degrees
*  I'm not I don't know. He used to be like head of rnd at procter and gamble really like this guy is brilliant
*  bonkers brilliant and
*  In fact, i'm gonna one of my students. Uh, mary works in she works in microbiology
*  And so I want to bring her up to to try and mentor under him a little bit. Wow some shit
*  uh
*  So grits corn grits corner
*  No, it's built out of a a giant, um, uh, one of those big cargo containers
*  What shipping container?
*  And so we're smoking cargo. Yeah, so we're smoking for smoking grits corn
*  And then we a custom thing that he's built himself. Correct. Yeah, so he's using actual wood
*  Yes, so we we use mesquite wood chips
*  So he has some sort of side cart that he's chucking the wood into and the smoke is going into this. Yep
*  Cargo. Yeah. Yeah, we have a is there a video this jamie. Uh, it's on the it might be on the
*  Warbringer bourbon website and might be up there of me a picture of me shoveling
*  So it was always warbringer bourbon even before the war master. Yes
*  I think it was because it was warbringer. Uh alfred one of the investors came to me and said hey
*  We could make this fucking thing. It's gonna you know, we you know, connor. McGregor's got a whiskey in this and I go hold on
*  I'm not here to talk bad about connor. McGregor and what he's doing
*  I don't I don't care if if my product and his product are different. It's fine
*  You know, and I understand the marketing potential, but I just i'm a whiskey head like I got into this shit living in japan
*  Uh, my my family's always drank whiskey
*  Uh, it's always been around us, but I really got deep into being a connoisseur of this shit living over in japan. And so
*  I I was actually actively searching to link up with a whiskey distillery
*  Yeah, there I am shoveling mesquite chips
*  to to create a whiskey
*  and I know that there's like mcconaughey and other people and you know slipknot has a whiskey lots of people are doing different booze, but uh,
*  I I really am
*  Involved in creating this and mcconaughey's got whiskey mcconaughey's got a whiskey with wild turkey
*  And wild turkey is a great distillery man, they make great shit. All right. All right blend probably
*  Well because mcconaughey i'm sure it's good, but generally the celebrity route is to make something for
*  The biggest audience possible, right? Right?
*  I did i'm like no, let's put out this big smoky motherfucker
*  You know, some people are going to be like, I don't dig it. Uh, it's fine
*  But for the most part suck it because people can fuck off good most people, uh,
*  I've i've had people come back to me and say this is the
*  Smoothest best whiskey they've ever had and um, it just makes me happy to bring
*  That into their life. Well, I love whiskey and it's very good. It's very good. It's very unique
*  The mesquite flavor is very unique. Exactly. Was that your idea to go?
*  No, that was that was david david came up with the with the original mesquite formula and all of this and
*  and then the other portion of portion portion of the the mash bill is malted rye or
*  Yeah, malted rye. So that goes into a mash and the way he
*  Ferments it is at three times as long as a normal whiskey fermentation cycle
*  So even if you get what's called the white dog, which is the stuff just coming off the still it hasn't been
*  Barrel aged in any way
*  And I sat there with this cat will from bourbon review and we're drinking straight up
*  This shit's smooth as hell at 160 proof
*  And it's because of the
*  Or 135, sorry
*  it's because of the the fermentation cycle and the fermentation that he the yeast that he uses all this and
*  As this thing gets done. We had three barrels three barrels to choose from and because it's a single barrel product
*  You got to choose them
*  So I did I tested every single barrel took notes did my deal and then we did a blind
*  And came back again same day and I tested again and I chose the same barrel twice
*  And so we went with barrel seven to be our initial release
*  This is what uh barrel eight and barrel nine was cycled back into normal warbringer
*  And then we've got another barrel sitting there ready to be put together because fucking batch one
*  Was done in like two months it was all sold out. It won a gold medal. It was gone. So when you
*  Is batch seven batch barrel seven barrel eight do they have the same flavor? No. Oh my goodness. So
*  Batch one which would which was barrel seven is 109 proof. This right here. This is batch two. This is barrel eight barrel
*  So this is different. Yep, and the difference is also in the proof
*  Yes in this case. Yeah, so once you stick it in the barrel, right you just got you whatever happens happens, right?
*  This is real shit. This is not some mass produced nonsense. No, this is when people say craft
*  Distillery or a small batch. This is we get about anywhere from 210 to 230 bottles out of any one barrel
*  That's that's and once it's gone. It's fucking gone. It's good stuff, dude
*  That's very good stuff. Yeah, I appreciate all that. I appreciate everything you just said the fact they're doing it that way
*  I that's the thing is i've always tried to
*  do everything that I do that way because
*  In a sense right if you take the concept of what what is your word right your word is is essentially
*  the the the social credit on anything you do and if your word
*  Doesn't have value right if it doesn't hold up to scrutiny if it doesn't consistent then
*  No one's gonna ever fucking believe you
*  Well when i'm endorsing things that's an extension of my word
*  So if i'm gonna put bullshit out in the world that I don't fully invest in
*  What am I then then my word is going to get degraded
*  So for even something like a whiskey you could easily just merchandise it like who gives a fuck right?
*  You could take that approach or you could take the approach of every bottle of this shit that goes out and gets into someone's hands
*  And touches their lips
*  Is an extension of me and my word?
*  And so a better hold up to it and if you don't like it, that's okay like
*  That's fine. It really is fine. Everybody's got their own palette
*  Yeah, but that's how you approach everything. I can't you're not a mass produced guy. I'm not man
*  That's why you're using that fucking samsung car trying to fight the power
*  My own little rebellion my own little
*  Most
*  You're out there fighting the power
*  Yeah, I love it. Fuck. Well, we need rebels legit rebels for real. We do man. You know today in particular
*  It's so easy to get sucked up in the herd mentality. Of course it is that nisha would say a man
*  a man goes into a crowd he
*  He comes in with one mind and gets rid of it and takes on another
*  and it's true, you know, uh,
*  there's a difference between the
*  mindset of
*  Groups and the mindset of the individual and I i'm not one to be like such a hardcore individualist where I think the individual is is
*  The start I mean I believe it is the starting point of everything but it's not the end point of everything and we're we're made
*  to be social creatures
*  Exiling somebody out of a tribe way back when was tantamount to basically giving them a death sentence
*  Yes, and they've said that somebody being in isolation away from other people can at
*  At at a point become more detrimental to even than even being an alcoholic
*  I don't know how they came up with that metric how that lined up per se
*  but I know that by not
*  being attached to not having proper interaction with others is
*  uh, it is is it's
*  Degradation to your sense of being and it is incredibly harmful to you
*  So we're made to be in groups and we're also made to be individuals now
*  I would say that the makeup of what you bring into a group is also related to what you create as an individual
*  You know if you if you come in as a fully formed healthy
*  Capable individual then you're only going to be somebody who could potentially as long as you can you can keep
*  What's important about yourself?
*  Um, you're only going to be a benefit to such a group. That's what's difficult for people though is to to to have
*  What's called personal sovereignty?
*  To be able to be yourself in a group. It's very hard for people
*  Well, yeah, and if a group does something, okay great
*  But if you're a part of that group, then you're accountable too
*  You can't just pass it off onto everyone else there's certainly a little bit of that but it's also just keeping your ideas
*  The same or not like sometimes there's benefit to change. I mean there's benefit to for sure to recognizing that these
*  ideas that you have
*  In a lot of cases
*  They're really just sort of a defense mechanism and they've sort of shielded you from growth
*  And then maybe you run into new people that have new ideas and these ideas resonate with you in a different way and you go
*  Oh, okay. Well now i'm faced with this truth that I can't ignore that my previous
*  conceptions of the world were twisted in some sort of a way how often do you come across people that will fight you tooth and nail
*  To the death to hold on to those preconceived notions a lot man. Exactly a real problem
*  a simple one I came across was even involved with this covet stuff was
*  trying to talk to people about
*  How the the the mainstream media has had bad narratives from the get you know
*  Be it they were given bad information, but they fucking doubled down on it all the time
*  Or if it's the who and they're running interference for china, whatever right? There's all this manipulation going on
*  Around something that is not that is
*  It's not subjective viruses aren't subjective. You just you can't play this game with that kind of thing
*  And people would fight me tooth and fucking nail
*  To defend the mainstream media over it and I go look here's example one, two, three, four five
*  Look at how they're all fucking wrong. They're fucked up. They're doing this. They're politicizing
*  They're doing all these different things for different reasons, but none of it is really for your own
*  betterment of understanding and to be safer and healthier
*  and or even just to say
*  We still don't know yet because we just don't have the data and people
*  Fight tooth and nail over this shit because there's so many people that use
*  The current media apparatus as their mainstream sense-making apparatus
*  And if you tear that away from them now, they have to sit back and go. What do I really know?
*  Right. What what is the reality of what I think?
*  Truth is what is what is the metric upon?
*  Understanding now that you've just showed me that and of course even at its best
*  Of course media is going to be faulty at times because it's just made up of people, right?
*  We're always going to be imperfect. We're always going to make mistakes, but there is no
*  Admitting of mistakes anymore. There's no saying I was wrong. We were wrong
*  There's also a problem with mainstream media and it's the same problem that we have with the police
*  You're giving people an inordinate amount of power
*  And when you give people that amount of power
*  They don't want to ever let it go and they don't ever want to say they're wrong and they don't ever want to admit fault
*  And they don't ever want to
*  Open the door to nuance, correct?
*  And that's what you see with whether it's cnn or fox news or any of these motherfuckers
*  They have this idea that they've been selling you whether it's this idea about russia
*  Whether it's the idea about covid what's the idea about trump what's the idea about biden?
*  I mean they're selling you some shit
*  And it's uh, it's very very difficult to get an unbiased perspective on the world
*  They came after you for no reason, you know, they would write all this kind of completely
*  disingenuous
*  uh, uh just narrative driven bullshit around you a person who brings people on and has conversations and tries to tries to
*  flourish that idea of
*  The the what are they going to marketplace of ideas like having conversations and trying to earnestly and sincerely explore things
*  And try to have a better grip on the world and try to better orient themselves
*  Towards just knowing and knowledge in addition to even having a fucking good time about it being here
*  It's a competitive thing too. Of course someone reaches a point where
*  They're they're they're interacting with too many people and they have this potential to really influence things
*  In terms of the political process in terms of the way people view things that becomes very dangerous for people that have
*  A different perspective on things or people that are connected to a traditional machine true, whether it's uh,
*  Newspapers or whether it's you know, and I have friends in both those things
*  I have friends in media and I have friends I have people that have apologized for things that other people have written
*  I'm like listen, man. It's part of the game. You're not going to rattle me. I'm okay
*  I get it you accept you're not you're not sitting here saying that it's okay
*  But what you're saying is I know what the landscape looks like. I know what I expect. I understand humans
*  I understand why people would attack me and I understand why you would even look at
*  very small
*  Things that are taken out of context and develop your own perception of me. That's inaccurate. I get it
*  I don't i'm not angry about it. Correct, but I don't
*  I don't
*  Want I don't want it to be any different I
*  This is what's fucked up
*  I kind of like I like the madness. I really do. I know what you feel I I
*  I wouldn't on a personal level. I can relate to that. Yes, if this world was logical a person like me wouldn't have no place
*  Where someone just comes from doing some?
*  Livestream on a fucking laptop and then 10 years later has hundreds of millions of downloads. It doesn't make any sense
*  I don't know. I think you're tapping into something that is this universal. I think that you know when it comes to like uh,
*  I love
*  studying history and and and religion because those are some of the oldest insights into the way people think and the way people act
*  and within these frameworks are tons of
*  Windows into human
*  thought process and psychology
*  And it's the same as you none of it has changed over the oldest
*  Religious texts the oldest historical things we can find the stories that exist the myths all these things
*  They're all this
*  This is the same shit over and over and over again
*  The first time I ever saw that was reading the haga kure and seeing that the complaints and the issues the criticisms
*  That this monk who was a former samurai had of his current era in the 19th century
*  the same criticisms and problems and the same
*  issues with people's
*  actions
*  deriving from the same
*  Human places of insecurity and psychological element. It's all the same shit. Nothing has changed
*  Like we're not any different than a person in the sixth century
*  Uh in the roman empire anything like that then then anybody this this era we're not different people
*  We have different technology. We have we have different communication in terms of which language you use, but
*  We don't act differently. We're not driven from different impulses. We're not you know, we're not russo. We're not a blank slate
*  You know, um
*  I don't I don't buy that concept at all because history would look so much radically different
*  But it fucking doesn't and i've written you
*  so many times
*  and at times whoever has your old number who's probably
*  Incredibly confused about what the fuck is this guy talking about but uh about how I think a person like you is
*  Critical to what towards the interaction of the current
*  Um paradigm is you are a necessity
*  Because right wrong whatever your personal opinion is is whatever it's the fact of creating the ability for people to get out here and speak
*  nobody ever had
*  Tulsi gabbard and bernie sanders in a place to feel more
*  Open and i'll say as politicians, they probably were as open as they could be but they're fucking politicians
*  in this current
*  And the paradigm of the western politician who knows how legitimately sincere any of those fuckers are but
*  This has been probably the only place that you could have had someone like that and allowed it to that window into their
*  their least
*  politician self, you know, I got to sit here and listen to
*  Uh, and reang talk about ubi and be like
*  Nah, dude, I don't I don't fucking buy it. But
*  I like you
*  You know, i'm fucking like you I like you, uh, or do you
*  It's just it's just a matter of not being so pent up on
*  Oh god
*  Well my narrative my my ideology my my fucking I gotta tribalize all this into such a degree that I have to tear down
*  Everything else around me so that mine can exist and that even goes to with this this bourbon or anything
*  I do like I don't need to I don't need to cut other things down from mine to rise
*  To to for other people to enjoy it
*  You don't have to
*  You don't have to tear apart the mainstream media
*  For yours to exist, you know now
*  Mind you the mainstream media tries to destroy you all the time
*  but
*  I think it's just players in the media. The media itself is just a
*  It's just a pathway for people to express themselves. It's very limited
*  I would say the media among a lot of things like there is a a good
*  For a term that I really like it's called managerial elites and so most things are big bureaucratic
*  Structures that have managers and it's just all managers everywhere and they're all operating into that human resource paradigm that we talked about
*  earlier and they don't flawed they don't
*  Managers don't usually create anything and this is not to say that managers aren't an important thing
*  I think managers are very important, but
*  How many times has anybody worked in a place where they have management that has
*  is so divorced from the creative or from the
*  the
*  Actuality of creating a product or maintain or whatever the the job role is and yet these people are making decisions all the time
*  And bleeding into telling people how to do their job instead of managing people to be able to be best at their job
*  Well, they're invested in as well because they have mortgages and they have bills and they have all they want the money to keep rolling in
*  So their idea is to make sure that whatever this thing that they're doing whether it's a newspaper or whether it's a television show
*  They want to make sure that they stay in the most
*  wide
*  Mainstream of lanes it's going to bring in the most money
*  And that's the weird part about media in general is that it's motivated by people that are trying to
*  Seek a profit. That's what they're doing. And there's a giant machine behind them. We have two video editors and jamie
*  That's the whole deal. That's the whole and you can't
*  You this this wouldn't exist any other way
*  Um, you would if you had more people you would have like well, you need a more diverse
*  A group of people working here. Oh, you need to hire this and you need to have you don't support trans people
*  And where where's your money? That's an assumption of that's that's putting bad faith on you. That's thinking that as if
*  some somebody who is trans or what have you might show up
*  For a job that you need filled and somehow you'd be like well because you're trans you can't know if they're capable of doing the job
*  You hire the fucking person. I agree, but the way it looks in terms of optics like people feel like they need to hire
*  You know x amount of asian people and x amount of this people and there's a weird
*  Climate right now. It's just a really bad heuristic. That's all that is
*  That's it's a horrible heuristic saying that the makeup of somebody's external or the makeup the external makeup of a company
*  Somehow has any real indication of its actual quality?
*  And character well, it's the lack of diversity is an assumption of prejudice
*  Correct, that's what it is. Like if you if you have a writing group like if you're on a sitcom
*  I am just going to say this because it's true. The majority is going to be white males that are jewish
*  Those are the writers on sitcoms and they they're really good at it. I mean there's a whole fucking culture attached to it
*  It doesn't mean that a an asian woman can't be a great sitcom writer. It doesn't mean but full on yeah, but it's it's a thing where
*  There's there's in many of these businesses
*  There's a tradition of of hiring a certain kind of people because they've been very effective at it
*  But there's also in a lot of these places of meritocracy. Is there a boys club in a lot of these places where yeah
*  There is as are they hiring their friends for sure?
*  Is is it harder to get in in some of these places if you're someone different?
*  I would imagine so I would imagine so there's all these different scenarios that can that can lay themselves out, you know
*  Some of it can even be perhaps that that the aggressiveness of men and towards acquiring certain positions
*  versus the
*  Maybe a more subtle approach a woman might take that's the argument about why women don't make as much money
*  That is that is the you know, one of the things I like about when when peterson brings that up is is and people always
*  Neglect this as he goes
*  It almost seems as if really that perhaps women are just fucking smarter than us
*  Like they're just saner they they're like, oh well, why be a maniac that only lives for this job?
*  Instead how about I be a person that does all these other fulfilling things in their life instead of driving myself into this
*  this insane
*  Near single-minded obsession right? That's the only metric that we're judging success by is money
*  Correct, which is money and social status inside of a corporation right money is a great tool
*  Clearly it can do a lot of things for people and and you know, it's a lot easier to
*  Exchange money with people than to exchange livestock
*  Fucking I don't know giant buildings and pieces of stone like what are you gonna fucking carry around a bunch of pieces of gold on you?
*  I mean, come on
*  A bill is probably the simplest solution though to creating ways of barter instead of actually
*  I mean really what we're talking about is happiness. Yeah, happy just isn't about the things you own so difficult to measure
*  Yeah
*  Well, I mean think of how happy someone might be buying something versus if you actually built it
*  Or think about how happy someone might be if they have this like really powerful career, but they don't have a family
*  Versus someone who does have a family who doesn't have any career really they just they make enough living to get by but they
*  They love being around their tribe. I keep telling people
*  like
*  There's there's there's two people that I I really idealize. I don't even know if they know this so
*  Bill and wanda goldberg and and michael jai white and gillian
*  are two
*  couples with families that I look at them and I think
*  This is proof that this is a thing that is that is
*  Creatable you can have a beautiful amazing family
*  And and have a great relationship and you can continue to create and make great things
*  And and you can you can really have it all it it really is possible and I look at that and that that's what I
*  Want that I want family. I want to be able to create
*  Uh my own sort of you know tribe around that from a familiar sense
*  And I want to bring some I want to bring a child into the world and and pass along
*  All that has been given and I say given to me by all these amazing people and all the amazing relationships and experiences that I've acquired throughout life
*  And I I try to do that with my so-called quote unquote kids my my my students
*  And I impart these this lineage down to them these experiences this knowledge
*  I give I give to them and I give to my friends and I do as much as I can to keep the
*  Keep the flame alive. Are you trying to tell me your baby fever?
*  That's what i'm hearing. Have you found a gal? I uh, you ready to shoot a live one into
*  You know, there's always practice. The practice is fun practice. I don't want to fuck this moment up
*  Are you uh, are you done fighting 100? No, no, no, I still uh 42 when do you think you'll be done when i'm done?
*  Just when you're done when i'm done. Yeah, I don't know what that window is
*  I just know that i've got some fights left in me. You're still selling bellator still signed and uh, what is the
*  They don't have a they have nothing going on right now. No nothing
*  Isn't interesting like why have they decided to not do events without an audience? I don't know because
*  Well, I guess they need the gate. I personally would love to even run like uh,
*  People have talked to me about running my blood sport events my my pro wrestling stuff that i've been doing
*  And uh me and gcw could easily put together a blood sport event with no
*  audience
*  and as long as we got the
*  The revenue to do so like we'll fucking we'll make a killer event. We don't need an audience for what we create, right?
*  And the ufc has done a great job in the way they have been handling
*  testing and putting people in um,
*  One of my my my best friend eric hammer, uh eric arabello
*  He trains and works with spike who fights in ufc right now ginger-haired wild man
*  And he told me all about the process they put everybody through for testing and he also works with bineel daryush. And so
*  You know
*  Hats off to the ufc for keeping people employed
*  I don't and this isn't to to knock at bellator either because they i'm sure they have their reason and the rationale
*  For for running their their business the way that they do but the ufc found a way that they could
*  Create the opportunity to keep people working so to speak
*  I think it's great. I'm glad that they're doing it and the testing is very rigorous and it works like
*  I mean we had a great fight this weekend that got cancelled. Yeah, gilbert burns supposed to fight
*  Kamaru usman. Yeah, but they had uh mazvidal waiting in the wings
*  Luckily, I mean, I don't know how much mazvidal has been training
*  I don't know. I don't know what the but he took it. Yeah, he took the gig. It's you know, very exciting props to them and um
*  Yeah, it's a bummer for the other fighter. Yeah, it's a bummer for gilbert, but yeah
*  Gilbert, you know as long as he's healthy
*  I actually thought it was a little quick for gilbert to be getting right back in after five hard rounds with tyron woodley
*  I mean that was just a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, perhaps. I mean maybe five weeks ago six weeks ago, whatever it was
*  But um the fights without a crowd are really exciting. It's real weird man
*  I know I personally would probably love it. I love the quietness in japan when I fight I fucking I I think it's the best
*  Yeah, we should explain that. Um, i've only done one ufc in japan, but it's amazing how polite the audience was
*  They they would really clap and applaud at strange things too. Like uh, like someone escaping from half guard
*  Well, they're just so well educated. Yeah
*  Combat sports is such an integrated part of japanese culture
*  Be it doing judo or karate or something like that is just in grade school or middle school
*  I remember watching them pass someone past the guard and everybody
*  Yeah, yeah, they know what they're looking at. That's crazy. They know what matters. Yeah, and it's uh,
*  And you know, there's sometimes I I really love
*  the raucous nature and uh energy of an american crowd, but
*  I think
*  at least for myself, uh
*  I just don't give a shit about anything else but going to war at that moment. I don't care about the crowd
*  I don't care about anything. All I want to do is
*  Is fucking kill that's there's something wild about watching it when you're right there and there's no crowd
*  Because you could hear the huffing and puffing you could hear the shit talk
*  You can hear the smack of a body shot you hear everything you hear the smack of shins when they check
*  You know, it's like it's a different experience man, and I don't think it's better
*  You don't think it's better. No, no, no because there's something about like a conor mcgregor fight at the fucking sold out t-mobile arena
*  Where everybody goes ape shit and shanaid o'connor singing and there's blue smoke everywhere and or green smoke everywhere
*  There's something wild about that too where it's a spectacle
*  But there's something uniquely raw about these apex fights where they have them at the apex center
*  And then the one we did one in florida as well. There's something uniquely raw about no crowd
*  intimacy versus intensity
*  Yeah, I don't know but man, there's a lot of fucking intensity like that tyrone woodley gilbert burns fight was fucking intense, man
*  You know, there's there's a lot of intensity in these fights as well. It's hard to call
*  I mean when you have a crowd again like when a man loses his mind and gains another
*  As this crowd starts to surge you get pulled into it
*  Yeah, so if you've got a protest and you're out here to say like hey
*  Fucking get your shit together and then someone starts lighting off fireworks in the middle of your crowd
*  You know everyone or someone starts turning it into hey get your shit together. Hey, we're gonna push your shit in right?
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  boom there goes mentality there goes people lose their shit and so uh plus or minus man, uh,
*  you go out there and a fight goes on and
*  And
*  When the crowd reacts like oh this really matters. Oh, yeah, i'm into it now. I i'm involved
*  Yeah, you are because everybody else around you is yeah. Yeah, of course you are right
*  Yeah, it's
*  They're both awesome
*  They're both awesome. I think that's a I completely can get behind that. They're a slightly different thing. They're a slightly different thing
*  You know, it's it's hard to wrap your head around it until you're actually experiencing a world-class fight
*  You know five rounds with no audience. It's they're different
*  Well, yeah, it's fucking amazing. They're both fucking amazing. I'm glad that it's going on. I'm glad for the fighters
*  Uh, i'm looking forward to when when scott and company get things up and rolling again
*  Uh, I just want to see the world
*  in general just open up to when
*  Fights can be a thing
*  Well, one of the interesting things that seems to be happening and i've been reading a lot about this is
*  One of the things is the cdc the death rate
*  Of covid has dropped so low. It's in in consideration being for being removed from pandemic status cdc
*  So, okay. Yeah, so I think what's happening is
*  Younger people are getting it now because a lot of people believe it or not got it because of the protest
*  I know it sounds crazy
*  What are you saying?
*  You're talking nonsense. What are you a right winger now?
*  No, i'm not and that's not what i'm i'm mean, come on folks you get 50 000 people and i'm all
*  Yeah, by the way, I should say i'm 100 in favor of protesting but i'm also 100 percent in favor of people
*  Wearing masks and going to a restaurant which I just did I was in texas this last weekend and in texas
*  They got it nailed man. Yeah, I know they have a lot of cases
*  They don't have look the debt the people in texas a lot of people
*  But also the death rate is lower for this round because it's there's two two possibilities
*  One possibility is that it's lower because it's about to spike up and there'll be more death soon
*  The other possibility is a herd immunity
*  Is that the the virus is potentially getting weaker like it's maybe possibly evolving
*  I've heard all these different arguments from all these different biologists. It's whole it's so hard to run down
*  Especially when you're a moron like me figure out what exactly is right the same boat
*  I'm trying to make sense of it my my head distiller david is used to work in infectious disease
*  And he's he told me about the structure of the disease itself and why why is soap and water so effective?
*  Well, the it emulsifies the fats around the virus itself and it breaks it down. This is also why things like
*  Windex will kill it. You know, it's not particularly hearty uv light kills it uv light will be light and sunlight correct
*  But he also says that you know coronaviruses are known for
*  Enjoying colder weathers so fall and winter is a possibility and then when you talk about spikes
*  so that thing one of the things that really was was in my mind when I was talking about people fighting tooth and nail to defend their
*  use of mainstream media as their
*  de facto sense-making apparatus
*  is that
*  I was posting stuff about wearing masks
*  And by the way
*  All the people the people that I listened to who were giving me information either stuff coming straight past the firewall in china
*  like weird twitter accounts and youtubers and whatever
*  I had my my
*  my supplies
*  end of january
*  because
*  One I live in an earthquake state and I needed to have it anyways
*  So it didn't make it wasn't like no skin off my nose
*  I didn't have enough I wasn't storing water and whatever and okay. I should have that just in case there's an earthquake, right?
*  So i'll do it for this and then but I had enough toilet paper I had enough things because I figured
*  People are gonna be the big problem. That's what that's the thing that I that's gonna affect this the most
*  And I told so many people and they all look at me like what are you some sort of fucking weirdo prepper and I go
*  I guess but when I can wipe my ass
*  You'll be you know, let's see what you do and uh, let's see how much your cat likes it when when you got no more toilet paper
*  Leftover you're fucking using your cats of white your ass. Well, that's not what i'm worried about. I'm worried about food
*  Oh food. Oh, I've washed your ass in the shower if there's water food and water is what's really
*  But I I was like look everybody we need to be wearing masks and people would fight me
*  Because the mainstream media said don't wear masks
*  Uh, you know, we need masks for the I'm like I look fuck face
*  I didn't say n 95 masks, which by the way, there's also n 99 and there's also p 95 and p 99 and there's
*  You don't even understand the classification of masks and now you're gonna fucking tell me when i've already done the research
*  And I know what the difference is and now you're gonna just fucking put cloth over your face do something when you had lex on here
*  Uh fucking sweet dude lex friedman. I love that guy and he's just simply showing you
*  That's enough. Yeah, and I said look if we're just wearing masks
*  As a guy who used to live in fucking japan
*  It helps because a lot of people in japan wear masks out of courtesy
*  It's just out of courtesy if they're feeling the sniffles or what have you?
*  Uh, really interesting isn't it that that culture was so ahead of the curve when it comes to mask wearing
*  With the with respiratory illnesses. Yes, full on and also because they're jammed on top of each other
*  Of course, there's that too, but they're all they they think about their own
*  They think about the honor of having their own social responsibility
*  For their part and things. And they've had a very low death rate. Very low. And then you know, what do they attribute that to?
*  I think it's due to uh
*  I personally think it's due to just mask wearing on a cultural basis. I think it's due to uh, if you tell people
*  In japan like okay. Hey, we got some shit coming up. Here's these three things you need to do and they will do them
*  right, it's the same reason why
*  when you have
*  Uh, you have a natural disaster coupled with a nuclear issue
*  like the uh, the tsunami fukushima that
*  the older
*  People will come up and go okay
*  Hey you younger guys, you've got families you've you've not lived as long as us leave. We're gonna go in we'll take care of it
*  You know, that's why they will
*  put together
*  uh
*  Resource centers or or fallout centers for people to to house in while everything's destroyed and no one's getting raped and murdered
*  whereas
*  Katrina hits you fill up the superdome because holy shit man. There's all these people that are displaced it is it's
*  It's you guys are suffering like mad. Okay. Well, we got this at least this
*  This piece of property that we can use to try and help people out
*  And it turns into a fucking nightmare in that place
*  That won't happen in japan. It's just not the way that they are. I find that so fascinating how cultures evolve so differently
*  It's it's just so interesting that human I mean even the negative aspects of it
*  Like I was talking to a friend of mine once we were talking about communism and the threat of communism
*  Oh, you don't have to worry about that here and i'm like listen man
*  The people that live in north korea are humans in 2020 correct and they are under the grip
*  of a military dictatorship, right?
*  There's no getting around that the people that live in the united states in 2020 are not no
*  But they're just humans on earth during the same time and there's styles of living
*  It's a weird weird way to look at it. But if you look at in terms of
*  Styles of living there are styles of living and these these styles of living whether whether you're in a cult or whether you're in a commune
*  or whether you're a part of a
*  Republican town or whether you're uh living in chas before they tore it down
*  There's styles of living and some styles are far more problematic than others
*  And the style of living that we should really be worried about is top-down power one person
*  Like a kim jong-un who's running the whole fucking show
*  And if you don't cry when his dad dies, you have to go to jail for six months, correct
*  And I I spoke to people I had a conversation with someone a long time ago and I go look
*  The problem is if if you have the ability to at least vote
*  I mean and we can I mean that's a whole nother discussion about how effective our votes are anymore
*  but at least there is some semblance of
*  us being a part of the process and being able to freely protest and do other things to try and
*  Influence the way government is going
*  When you have this massive top-down structure, it's just not going to happen
*  They're going to dictate from top down plus it's the idea that you can
*  You can predict everything that everyone's going to need all the time
*  And that's just impossible. You can't predict every necessity. You can't predict every
*  Every problem that's going to come
*  Uh, it's just not you can't do it. Well, this virus has shown that for sure
*  Well long supply change you want to
*  You want to push all your manufacturing out to other places you want to stretch out all your supply lines or how about all the people?
*  Running businesses on the edges all the time like oh if you get money don't save it spend it
*  Going to you know buy more debt to do this with it. And then all of a sudden this happens
*  It's like well, you're fucked you didn't save anything. You didn't see it coming. Yeah, you missed it
*  You missed this opportunity to yeah, I mean and look I would not want to be a mayor or governor right now
*  But you're also seeing the different ways mayors and governors handle these things
*  And you know some of them are of the idea that you should be willing
*  To let your people take chances and these people should
*  If they want to they should be able to make a living they should be able to wear a mask and protect the elders and protect
*  the sick people there is a
*  There is a possibility to create protocols
*  to
*  Take into consideration the unknown
*  And protect as many people as I mean i've been wearing a mask
*  Every public place I go to I wear a mask
*  I just do
*  and
*  Do you attribute your time in Japan for like your sensitivity to that that and just uh
*  What?
*  What I what what I understand what little I will say I understand
*  um from even reading people like
*  Nassim Taleb or Balaji Srinivasan or any of the or epidemiologists are talking to my head distiller
*  Or my student Mary who literally works on covid machines in a microbiology lab
*  really
*  Okay, I can understand a little bit, but I know that even they
*  Don't have all the information
*  Nobody can right it's novel because it's new now
*  I know that they've been studying chinese horseshoe bat coronaviruses since like 2015 or maybe even sooner than that especially after
*  The issue that the world had with SARS. So of course it starts to become a priority
*  Fine, but here we are here and now
*  What I don't know. I'm not going to just assume that things will just be fucking fine
*  That's that's just not a way I can approach things what I have to do is what I can take on responsibility for myself
*  Okay
*  That's mine, but for other people different story
*  And when I can do something as simple as wear a mask and be in public
*  I'm not damaging. I i'm ensuring myself and others from hardly doing anything
*  Well, we also talked about before the podcast you take the necessary precautions to protect your own health
*  In terms of supplementation in terms of yes, of course and and and
*  Following up on any kind of studies and just any previous understanding of supplementation in regards to other viruses and infection and things like that
*  but also
*  as
*  When I when this first came down
*  Uh, I had stuff to protect my eyes. I had in 95 masks. I had a tyvek suit if need be
*  What's a tyvek suit, uh, they usually use them for painting and things like that
*  But you can duct tape them off and what have you and you can create who knows right?
*  But I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's gonna happen. I just know that I don't want to get fucked
*  Yeah
*  That was the big fear when when the shit hit the fan the big fear was that this was going to be something that we
*  Really had to worry about that was going to kill, you know
*  Could have been could have been uh, but then okay, so it's not
*  That bad at least right so but for a while there
*  What I would do is when I would leave the house
*  I had my outdoor clothes and my indoor clothes when I came back in the house
*  I took all my shit off in my little foyer
*  Put it in the corner
*  Cleaned took a shower cleaned up then put on my indoor clothes
*  Really to make sure that if I was an issue
*  All right. I'm not I don't know what this virus can or will do
*  But i'm i'm gonna avoid bringing it into my house as best as possible. Josh Barnett was going all out and so then
*  As I started to learn that okay
*  Doesn't seem like it's just like it is gnarly. It's real but it's gnarly to certain people
*  and
*  I have a few friends with it was nothing. Yeah, I am
*  Impressed I think I've already had it. I think I got it. We're gonna find out in 25 minutes
*  Yeah, um, I think that to be honest
*  I really believe there's several strains and i've read that but I mean it only makes sense
*  There may be a few strains for sure. Although
*  Um from what sources I have uh coronaviruses and are not
*  They're they're not the kind of thing that mutates very much and what they're more likely to do is become more benign and not more
*  Aggressive I have heard that but I also have heard that the strain in india is so vastly different than the strain here
*  That if they develop a vaccine for the strain that's in north america, it literally won't work for what's in india
*  Yeah, possibly, you know not enough curry
*  Ah
*  It's a turmeric thing. That's a turmeric thing. Um
*  For sure. This is a trying time for us. It is for everybody, you know
*  Think about being in india think about being all these other places. It's it is
*  It is it's also like really ramped up all the anger. I think a lot of it comes to
*  Fear there. Yeah, and there's fear the unknown is one of the greatest motivators or creators of fear
*  But I would say that this reminded me a lot from get as soon as it was like, okay
*  we need to shelter in place or
*  Safer at home or whatever the case may be
*  And it just made me think of cormac mccarthy, uh in no country for old men. He wrote
*  You know, you can you can change your name. You can do this
*  You can do that and go go to some other place and you know, but at the end of the day
*  When you when you're laying there in bed and you look up at the ceiling
*  It's uh, it's just yourself staring back at you
*  And uh, you're you're made up of the of the the days that came before and nothing else
*  So you can cry and change what all but you're not any different. You're the same person
*  It doesn't matter where you are in the world. You're still you and so these people
*  Are having to sit there at times especially those that don't you know, there's these people in a relationship where they're now starting to realize
*  Well, what kind of relationship do I really fucking have like what is is built upon?
*  Or even sitting at home and people having to sit there and basically be in the mirror all day long with themselves
*  And how many people are really
*  How many people are really built upon the
*  foundational tools of like fulfilling meaningful things like things that
*  I
*  Here, I don't want to die
*  Tomorrow today not even five years from now not ten hell
*  If given the chance I would fucking live a thousand years if I could because I think that this world is so fucking amazing
*  That there is there. I don't think I could learn all the languages eat all the foods
*  Even the ones I don't like see all the mountains all the architecture meet all the people all the cultures all the fucking everything that exists
*  In this just glorious fucking amazing place
*  I don't know that I I feel sad that my life can't go on long enough to know these things and
*  But
*  I've lived such a life to this point. There are things that
*  10 year old me would just have just fucking had a
*  Aneurysm thinking that this was ever going to be the way his life turned out considering what an an outcasted
*  You know pushed aside bullied fucked with you know
*  really sort of
*  twisted up a confused
*  young lad and getting to where I am now and I can leave this place and die and
*  My life has been all fucking great. I've I've lived i'm fulfilled. I
*  I live because I want to experience things. I want to create more. I want to do more with my life
*  But my life has been great enough
*  It's been great. I've had all the things that I need that are essential success. That's real success
*  Yes, now it's real success. It's hard to find it is very hard to find but getting through
*  All the adversity and coming out on the other end better for it. Yeah, i'm more concerned like in an ensign in a way
*  Way, I want to die, right?
*  I think more about that, you know, or like the stoics how to you know, I want to die, right?
*  I want to go to valhalla. I want to I don't want to
*  die a pathetic way
*  From living an epic life
*  That's more of a concern
*  Uh in in terms of death, but otherwise no death is there death is coming death's alongside me
*  Death's riding in the car with me everywhere. I go and that's fine. He's a good he's a good fucking wingman. It's great
*  Well, there's there's that energy that comes with death
*  That's that makes life so exciting if you were immortal it'd be like playing god mode in a video game
*  Is it's not exciting? No, have you ever played god mode in video games? No, I fucking have hey you're on here, right?
*  So I fucking played doom scared me as a kid when we're like my friends like check this shit out
*  You know, it's like a fucking secret drug deal. Yeah, popping the little disks in the library computers. We're like, okay. Okay, what's this?
*  Oh, you know, it was just yeah, what a freakout. Um, yeah, I played god mode and god mode is whack
*  Yeah, it's terrible because you can't die
*  Nope for people don't know we're talking about when you play god mode you have unlimited ammo and you can't die
*  Yeah, you can't die. It ruins life. Yeah, it ruins the game games are thrilling
*  But a video game where you're playing in god mode is terrible and the reason why is because there's no consequences
*  There's no risk same thing as life. There's no risk. There's no risk if there's no struggle if there's no there's no there's no overcoming
*  And you know, it's it's like I always say like I always say
*  I have this I a concept of human entropy that all humans without proper
*  Suffering and overcoming to use some just some you know, some generic words and obviously from a nichian perspective
*  Uh, you just go to your lowest state of energy and people are
*  All all things in the universe are subject to entropy and humans are no different
*  And so obviously we experience entropy and that our bodies break down and obviously we have cellular degradation and things like that
*  but uh, but we can
*  We can spiritually degrade and if we don't
*  have
*  Proper overcoming if we don't have a certain kind of suffering in our life or or or agitation
*  We don't grow agitation is a great way agitation is a great. Yeah, and uh, i'm also a big fan of uh heidegger
*  So like being towards death
*  knowing that
*  this is inescapable stop trying to
*  to look for anything to
*  alleviate
*  The burden of your own death and the responsibility of your own creation of an authentic life
*  You because at the end of the day you can do all these different fucking things
*  You can change your mind you can you can become an um, this kind of an uh fucking ideological
*  Communist or you're a alt right or you're this or you're that you can create all these little things you can be a christian or
*  a catholic or whatever right you can you can if you're using these things to replace your
*  your
*  ownership of authenticity and
*  the carrying the burden of your own being in the world then eventually
*  Regardless of all the shit that you do when you're laying in bed at night and you're looking up at that fucking ceiling
*  You know that you're a fucking fraud and that you're you you have offload you've tried to offload something that you can't get rid of
*  Yes, yes
*  100 well put I tell people don't ever seek comfort seek clarity and seek improvement
*  You're not gonna comfort sucks
*  Comfort's great for a couple hours. You want to chill and watch a movie, but comfort as a lifestyle is
*  Bullshit it's like you're not gonna get any improvement. You need to be tested that that term agitation is excellent
*  How how far did you start shooting arrows at to practice?
*  Well, I was really fortunate that I was taught by great people, you know cam haines taught me and you know
*  He had me probably like 15 yards at first
*  Practicing 10 15 yards and now where do you shoot at? Well in here I shoot at 45 yards
*  But I have a range at the house that goes to 85 yards, but you had to get there
*  Yeah, you know I went shooting yesterday and
*  Pistols pistols and
*  You know I can I could put some groups together and honestly part of that's because you know the the pistols
*  I'm using are fucking they're accurate enough to do it. It's it's not them. It's me and
*  I like to you know go not not to shoot shit at 10 yards and 6 yards like okay
*  Well 10 yards is fine or whatever, but unless I'm doing a specific, you know motion derived drill. I
*  Don't whatever man I can hit center mass and I can hit ahead all the time. I don't care about that
*  I want I keep pushing it out as far as I can go in the
*  Yeah, well because I want to get better and I you know, I bring it back in I'm like
*  It's not it's not not good enough. Yeah, I've been shooting my old 44 Auto Mag as much as I can
*  Recently, especially they're starting to make new ones
*  They're gonna redevelop revamp and re-reput this fucking thing out there and I'm like, oh, yes. Thank God. I can get new parts
*  It's great. It's the original
*  Cartridge was made by taking like a 30-06 or 308 rifle cartridge
*  You put it in a in a base block and you and you cut it down to size
*  You've remit flare it and then you make your ammunition out of that using a port point four to nine caliber bullet
*  I reload
*  Do you really? Yeah, I'm a reloader. I grew up reloading shooting hunting fishing
*  So when you shoot rounds you save your shells
*  If it's 44 Auto Mag yes or 475 Wildy or any of these kind of wildcat weird things that I shoot yeah, I reload
*  But if it's just 45 it's cheaper to just buy whatever, you know, regular shoot them up
*  I'm only probably get a satisfaction at the reloading right? Oh a hundred percent because again
*  It's the being involved in the process and the creating part of it
*  And one of the things why I love my Auto Mag so much is because well one I'm a fucking weirdo
*  So if everybody says hey do the easy thing. No, I want to do the weird and odd thing
*  I want to go. No, why do jiu-jitsu and you can catch wrestling, right?
*  But why use a manual or an automatic? Yes, I use a manual. I use an iPhone
*  so, you know for me it was yeah, let's buy this gun made in 1970 and it has
*  Incredibly rare amount of spare parts available and reloading data and all this stuff like yeah, sure. I'm game
*  Yeah, I'll do it and a lot of kick too, right? It's not that bad actually
*  I mean it kicks pretty substantial, but I've seen women shoot them with no problem, but
*  You know, I I learned to the point of taking the in fact, I dislocated my shoulder fighting crowcop
*  So I couldn't work on my my Cobra
*  my Mustang and I
*  Couldn't even drive it at the time. Well, this blows what can I do?
*  alright, well my arms in a sling I'm gonna take this my Auto Mag apart and
*  Completely take it down to the frame have the frame be blasted put it all back together and then I I was on this forum
*  So I'm talking with this legendary
*  Pistolero rest in peace Lee jurors who is famous for creating these custom badass
*  Automags and like taking antelope with automags at that like 200 300 yards. Yeah. He's bonkers
*  He is so incredible. Anyway crazy shot chatting with this fucker and
*  Yeah, well, I mean or he could use sticks and freehand whatever like the guy is like one of the great American pistol shooters
*  Wow, and so
*  I'm sitting there just chatting with this guy on direct message on fucking forums and he's like, yeah
*  Okay. Well when you're gonna if you want to slick this action up, here's here's the type of compound
*  I would use here's this, you know, here's the places and so here I am
*  Just fucking away playing around on this little this tinkering around on this piece and I'll put my gun back together
*  And I'll take go out and shoot it and it just fucking clover leafs things and this is you know, it's brilliant
*  But it's also the brilliant that we're regardless whether it's pistols or what it doesn't matter. You're learning you're learning
*  You're putting yourself in the position to where okay
*  Well, you're gonna make mistakes and yeah, and and now you're part of that creative process by being as involved in the whiskey
*  It means that much more to me, but I also
*  Don't know any other way to do it
*  Like I probably could have had someone make that playlist for Spotify for me or just thrown in a few tracks and then just use the
*  Recommendation at the bottom. Yeah, but it wouldn't be all that weird obscure fucking death shit that you like
*  Wouldn't be dissection. Yeah, it wouldn't be there's Melvin's are in there the Bronx
*  Bands that I've never heard of yeah, I bet you'd like the Bronx. I know you'd like the Bronx
*  They're not a death metal band. What are they? They're a hardcore punk band out of LA. Okay, and you would like them
*  Okay, send me a text message fuck yeah, let's just do it. I will I will I will
*  but it just being involved in the process and starting from
*  Not knowing anything and then that
*  Overcoming man. Yeah, I can't agree more man. I love learning shit and I love doing new things
*  I love being a beginner
*  I think being a beginner is like really rewarding and I think that as you get better in things
*  Where you're just starting out in these things? I really feel like it enhances everything you do
*  I just think I think it just adds an edge
*  To to your mind and as a person who does this for a living or I talk to people for a living
*  I think it's crucial because if I just did the same thing over and over and over again
*  I'd be I I would have I wouldn't have any frame of references
*  I wouldn't I wouldn't have any interest in like it fuels my curiosity
*  Which is I think is the one of the most important parts of what I do
*  I have to be curious and I just happen to be which is why it worked out in the first place to do a podcast
*  It's fueled by doing new things. Well and your podcast like anything else anybody does will take on evolution
*  Yeah, and one of the things that I would say in regards to you is the way people
*  talk about you to me says more about them than it ever says about you and
*  When I have someone
*  Let's say, you know respond and take a bunch of uncharitable takes I'm like, oh you actually don't fucking pay attention
*  You're really not listening you're not listening at all you don't understand anything that what Joe's creating here
*  You you have no you have no clue and you're telling me not about you at all. You're only telling me about yourself and
*  I
*  Just
*  Through everything you do that opportunity for new pathways new growth better understanding
*  What is it Maya Angelou quote?
*  We do the best we can and when we know better we do better and that's a really simple way of looking at things
*  But when we know better we can do better when we know better whether we do better
*  We can just do differently sometimes and seeing this the the progress of this podcast
*  like I told you I
*  Talked to people from the Internet dark web now. I talked to the IDW guys. I talked to
*  Dr. So I talked to James Lindsay. I talked to Eric Weinstein
*  I've been to dinner with Eric and there's probably other people I'll meet through this and
*  For me, it's just I want to be exposed to all these people's ideas and thoughts in these conversations
*  Especially when they're gonna be in areas of expertise
*  I'm not an expert. Yeah, it's fascinating and for me
*  It's very valuable to be able to get those people's thoughts and yours as well to get them out to the world
*  I think it's very beneficial and I think for a guy like you
*  It's very beneficial because they look at you and again if they look to you on the outside they go all the youngest ever
*  Fucking UFC heavyweight champions got some shit to say fuck out of here. I get a lot of this
*  Oh, I'm so surprised that you know, I really didn't expect that this that or the other and I won't okay
*  Yeah, that's just preconceived notions and it's also it's more comforting for someone to look at a barbarian like you and say well
*  He's got to be dumb and then when you're not
*  Then they'll try to diminish whatever salient points you've had and that's again it says more about them than it does really
*  I've seen it on Twitter where they're like, oh well, you know, what a dummy you are clear
*  You've been hitting the head too much
*  Do that but that's that's also the sign of a loser
*  Of course it is it's a sign of someone that doesn't actually want to engage in anything in good faith
*  It's also they don't want other people to be good at things. Yeah, they don't like it
*  People of course and I could have said I feel like
*  personally that I've
*  Something I've had to deal with in my life is that I think that there was or is maybe even still
*  this
*  Idea this construct of what I'm supposed to be and how successful or
*  What have you I'm I'm I should be right and if I exceed that people get pissed
*  That I'm somehow doing something in a way that they don't think I should be or that I'm getting
*  Notoriety in a way they don't I'm no no no, you're not supposed to be that person
*  Now you're supposed to be this and only this if you exceed that fuck you for for not being what I want you to be
*  And what they don't understand is that that's fucking them. Of course, it's they don't understand that though
*  They think that somehow or another I mean, I mean, I don't mean it's I don't mean that's them
*  I mean, it's fucking them over. Yes that that mindset is fucking them
*  It's it's when you want someone to do poorly
*  You're exposing the flaws in your own thinking exposing your own personal weakness
*  It's super unhealthy and I used to have it man
*  I used to I used to want comedians to fail when I first started doing it
*  I used to want people to get their ass kicked when I first started doing martial arts
*  I used to want that because I was a weak person and I didn't but I realized it and I said, oh
*  This is a trap like I have this thing where I am fearful that I'm not
*  Rising to the level of my full potential and so I want other people to fail
*  So that where you're at at this point can then still can be the new
*  the new peak
*  You're only halfway up the mountain as long as nobody gets higher than that it's good enough
*  Yeah, yeah
*  and I realized that when I was like 21 and I really I remember real distinctly the time period when I recognized it I
*  just recognized that I had a deep flaw in the way I was looking at things and
*  And I realized like oh, this is a this is weak and then and then but once I recognized it as a weakness
*  It was impossible to embrace it anymore
*  Then I realized like okay that feeling of discomfort that you get when it when looking at someone's clearly better than you at stuff
*  That should be a blessing
*  You should be happy that that person exists that person is fuel
*  That's gonna motivate you to do better as long as you approach it with the right mentality
*  As long as you don't become a hater haters are all losers. There's no
*  There's no winners that are haters and they don't even realize that every time they hate they think they're getting you or getting that guy
*  Taking her down or or throwing these jabs out there and that it's gonna work and make you feel bad
*  What they don't realize is they're literally stealing time away from their own interests and loves
*  They're caging themselves. Yes to be only as good as they are at that moment. It's super dangerous. It's really bad for you
*  Yes, it is so intoxicating and so easy to fall into well nobody lies to themselves more than themselves, right and
*  Unfortunately
*  We are the best at
*  finding every excuse we can to justify our position and
*  Just like okay getting your I'm dealing with whatever from all this
*  Ideological poisoning and all this shit in my own home and yet
*  at the end of the day instead of going out there and just being like look at how terrible everything is and just
*  Taking a very surface level understanding just being like well it sucks
*  I'm gonna tell you it sucks and I'm gonna tell you that this person sucks and blah blah blah blah
*  But the reality is is that okay?
*  Even the ideological stuff. It's not all bullshit
*  Not everything is a lie and it wasn't necessarily created just to damage me like stop stop making it all about myself
*  And even then it's also like okay
*  If all you can do is say something bad about the person that you chose to be in a relationship with
*  Then that says more about you than them and to think that I would never be involved in somebody with somebody that I didn't
*  Love and enjoy and so to say that regardless of how things
*  Finished that doesn't mean to sit there and say that that which was negative takes precedent over anything else is
*  A really myopic way of viewing things and it's more or less. I would see it as a tool to
*  To narrow your focus into that which you you want
*  To take precedent which you so you can you can justify your your
*  Grievance in this instead of saying okay. Well I can have a real grievance, and that's totally acceptable and I can I can
*  Create I can I can justify it I can show for the grievance itself
*  But this wasn't only a grievance the whole thing itself isn't nothing but grievance it isn't nothing but bad if it is
*  Then it's on your fucking ass. Yep. That's it seek clarity kids
