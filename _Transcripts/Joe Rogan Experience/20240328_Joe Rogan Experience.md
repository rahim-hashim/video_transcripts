# Joe Rogan Experience #2127 - Eleanor Kerrigan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRZeJz2k88w)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello, Ellen Nowera.
*  Great deep breath.
*  How are you?
*  You really took that in.
*  What's going on? What's cracking, kid?
*  Nothing. I'm excited to be here.
*  Excited to have you.
*  Woohoo!
*  How's LA treating you?
*  LA's good. I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't been there a lot.
*  After I filmed my special, I just, I mean, I'm on the road so much.
*  Right.
*  So, which is good. And then I get to go to Philly.
*  In between, I hang out with my mom.
*  So, in between gigs, I'll just hang out with my moms.
*  Instead of going back to LA.
*  But I feel like I haven't been.
*  I think I was there for five days last week.
*  Yeah, it becomes, when you do the road all the time, your house sort of just becomes some stop.
*  Yeah, but I have no responsibility whatsoever.
*  Like, I don't have a, I don't have a plant.
*  I have nothing.
*  What a nice, what a free, what a free existence you've carved out for yourself.
*  What an asshole. So selfish.
*  It's funny because people think about it that way.
*  Like, you have to have things you're responsible for.
*  Otherwise, you're a bad person.
*  Yeah, I always tell my mom, I'm living her what she would want to, wanted to do had she not had 10 children.
*  Hmm. 10 children.
*  Yeah, good times.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Keep it up, lady.
*  10 kids is so bonkers.
*  Who does that?
*  How about on the ninth one?
*  You're like, one more.
*  Her worst pregnancy.
*  The ninth one?
*  The ninth one, longest delivery.
*  My little brother Bobby, she said that's how lazy he was.
*  He wouldn't come out.
*  He's so lazy.
*  She said he was hanging on for dear life.
*  I'm like, why?
*  And she said, because he's lazy.
*  It'd be an interesting study to have 10 kids and just to see like what makes them come out different.
*  Because they're fucking, this is one thing, like having children, seeing them from babies,
*  you realize like, oh, they're different right out of the box.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it is zero to do with like what you tell them.
*  This is what you should do.
*  Like a lot of them is just how they come from the factory.
*  Exactly.
*  And you always think like, I know this genetic stuff, like there's you inherit stuff genetically, whatever, you know, I'm pretending I know what I'm saying.
*  And epigenetics.
*  Yeah, but my, oh, that's good.
*  Yeah, I remember that.
*  Anyway, I asked my mom to write this thing for me, like what she was going through with each kid just to see if I can get it.
*  Because we are all different, like in the craziest way.
*  Oh, like in her life.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what was going on.
*  And it is interesting because when it gets to my brother, Charlie, like she was going through stuff with my dad and physically her whole body.
*  She was pregnant.
*  Her kidneys were failing and they had to literally move him to the side.
*  You know, operate on her kidneys, take it out, whatever, before it like killed the baby.
*  And it was insane.
*  Like she tells the story.
*  I'm like, oh, what?
*  How? Right.
*  Why?
*  And then she said they put it back, cleared her out.
*  She was good.
*  The kidneys didn't affect anything.
*  And then they assumed Charlie was going to be stillborn.
*  So she, the nurse came in and she was like real down.
*  And the nurse goes, are you nervous you're going to miss, you're going to lose this child?
*  And she's like, is this your first?
*  And my mom goes, no, this is my sixth.
*  And she goes, you go right ahead and lose that baby.
*  Oh my God.
*  The nurse said that?
*  It's a different time.
*  Oh my God.
*  Imagine if a nurse said that today.
*  She'd be executed on the spot.
*  Humans were so different before social media.
*  Yeah, it was so cool.
*  What is that?
*  Is it accountability?
*  Is it that we're now influenced by so many different people?
*  Is it like a lot of it is just more bullshit?
*  Like people can't just say what they really think because they're just terrified they're going to get attacked by so many people.
*  So you bullshit more.
*  And that lady was telling the truth.
*  Yeah, she was telling the truth.
*  That's all she did.
*  And she was in a weird way.
*  She was trying to encourage your mother to feel better.
*  Like, hey, you've got six kids.
*  You're going to be fine.
*  You're good.
*  You can lose this one.
*  She was just being serious.
*  By the way, Charlie's in his 50s.
*  He's fine.
*  Amazing.
*  They didn't know a lot back then.
*  I don't know which one of your brothers I've met.
*  You've met Jimmy.
*  I know that.
*  And he tortures me.
*  He's like, I want that car.
*  I'm like, he's a car guy, the Bronco.
*  Oh, my Bronco.
*  He's obsessed with the Bronco.
*  It's like, I'll come now.
*  I'll take it.
*  I'll just take it.
*  I'm like, oh, God.
*  So this is one night at the Comedy Store.
*  They're crazy.
*  I don't know if you'll remember this
*  because it was more like, I was a nervous wreck.
*  Jimmy was visiting.
*  He installed computers all over the country.
*  So he would come to LA a lot.
*  And he'd just pop in to the Comedy Store.
*  And we'd be like, oh, shit, my brother's here.
*  So we're hanging out.
*  We were all hanging out, like, in the, what is it called,
*  like the back?
*  Where the parking lot is?
*  Kind of, but like in the side.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You know, in the little.
*  You're sitting on the ledge and Don Barris was saying crazy shit to me, right?
*  And in a way, Don does it.
*  We love it.
*  We love it.
*  But I'm dying and he's saying like horrible shit, right?
*  But we're crying laughing and Jimmy was like just taking it in like, what the fuck is this?
*  And you look at Don and you go, Don, look at his calves.
*  Rethink what you're saying.
*  Because Jimmy has these ridiculous calves and he's like Popeye.
*  And he was wearing shorts.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Jean shorts.
*  I'm positive.
*  He's an idiot.
*  But I was like, Don, you're about to get smashed.
*  Yeah, he's like, dude, calm down.
*  And you're like, Don.
*  It just made me laugh so hard.
*  Like every time I think about it.
*  But Jimmy was in a lot.
*  Men who don't know or understand dangerous men are hilarious.
*  And Jimmy walks on his knuckles.
*  He's got giant hands.
*  Like everybody always sees his hands and they're like, oh God.
*  It's also from a different part of the world.
*  Right.
*  It's basically like picking a fight with a Russian.
*  Philadelphia dudes, they're fucking different animals.
*  Yeah, they're not.
*  They fight way more often.
*  It's like Philly, Boston.
*  There's like a few cities like that, parts of New York where you better shut the fuck
*  up, man.
*  Just take it in.
*  They'll fucking hit you quick.
*  A lot quicker than you think.
*  Like you're not going to have any room for talking your way out of this.
*  You're going to get hit.
*  It's not going to help.
*  Don Barrett.
*  I remember Don's face like what?
*  I remember thinking like, oh my God, what happens here?
*  Your brother's going to beat the fuck out of poor Don Barrett.
*  And Don's just saying, you know.
*  But that was a thing though.
*  Because we play those games.
*  Don would do that to everybody.
*  He would go on stage in the later spot, the last spot in the OR.
*  And that show was done.
*  It was done two hours ago.
*  And somehow or another there's still people in the audience.
*  So those people in the audience, they're the strangest of people.
*  Like some of them are just ne'er do wells.
*  Nothing's ever worked out for them.
*  But then finally at 1 30 a.m. in Hollywood on the Sunset Strip on Tuesday, they found
*  their tribe.
*  They found their tribe.
*  And it's just them and a few other fucking scragglers and Don Barrett.
*  And Don Barrett is telling you how big his dick is.
*  And he's like...
*  And he's put his foot on the table, staring people in the eye.
*  He's just doing...
*  He's developed this style to do like kind of anything to get laughter out of people
*  that have seen everything.
*  You have to understand for people that are listening how the Comedy Store works.
*  You get there.
*  The show starts on a regular night, starts at 8 o'clock.
*  What is it?
*  What is it?
*  Potluck.
*  What night is it starting on Potluck?
*  It was Sunday and Monday for a while.
*  It was Sunday, Monday, Tuesday for a while.
*  We were dying.
*  Was it Tuesday too?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  What time...
*  When does Potluck start?
*  I think it starts at 7.
*  Okay, so that might be...
*  Don Barrett might go on at the end of all the comics who go on after the end of all the
*  open micers.
*  So there might be people that are on fucking all kinds of shit.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And they're just like...
*  Methadone, fucking Adderall.
*  How many drinks they had.
*  Their whole life's a mess.
*  They've been texting their ex through the entire show and she's not texting back.
*  These fucking lost, lost people.
*  The dregs of society.
*  And Don Barrett would have them left over.
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen people like women walk out on their guys because they're just...
*  Don's like, let me spit in your mouth.
*  You know?
*  What?
*  I'm like, you want another rum and coke?
*  I'm trying to sell drinks.
*  It's so crazy.
*  He was just trying to...
*  I mean, he essentially developed a style to just...
*  The king of late night.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he put on a show, right?
*  Right.
*  It wasn't just his stand up.
*  He had a show.
*  Yeah.
*  He really knew he would play music sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a lot going on.
*  He was entertaining you, which is interesting.
*  He's an entertainer.
*  He's truly the freest of entertainers.
*  When I go up, I still get nervous.
*  I don't know if you get nervous at all.
*  Sure.
*  You do?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Sometimes I feel like an idiot.
*  If you care about something, you're going to get nervous.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it is.
*  I panic a little.
*  Don Barrett just doesn't...
*  He just walks up like, hey, it's me.
*  Maybe it's from years of doing the warm up as well.
*  I think that too.
*  I think it's a reps thing.
*  It's reps.
*  How many reps do you put on stage?
*  Some of those guys in New York that were hosts, they would get better really quick, especially
*  at their delivery.
*  Because if you're hosting these nights in New York where people are doing seven minutes,
*  you're going on stage, you're interacting with the crowd over and over and over again.
*  You find a way to be yourself.
*  It's like the inauthentic thing that a person does on stage.
*  You feel it while you're doing it.
*  The audience feels it.
*  They might laugh still, but you know that you're not really...
*  But then when someone figures out how to be just them for whatever reason, like Sebastian,
*  he had to figure that out.
*  Sure, sure.
*  It took him a minute.
*  But he did.
*  And when he figured it out, it was like instantaneous murdering.
*  It went from a guy trying to figure it out to, oh, I got it.
*  Joey.
*  Do you remember the early days of Joey?
*  Joey Diaz?
*  Yes.
*  Interesting.
*  Do you remember?
*  I do, but I...
*  Joey used to bomb.
*  Joey used to bomb.
*  It was crazy.
*  It didn't make any sense.
*  He was the funniest guy in the parking lot.
*  And then he would get tense when he would go on stage and he wouldn't have a good set.
*  It just wasn't him.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, it was more jokey joke.
*  He was trying to be a comedian.
*  He was trying to be some guy that's on late night television or something.
*  Maybe because I saw him in that light, the parking lot light, or he would fuck with me
*  if I was waiting tables.
*  So it would make me laugh.
*  So I didn't judge what he did on stage.
*  He was the funniest guy of all time, talking to people.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You would scream.
*  There were a few of us hanging around and Joey came over.
*  All of a sudden the life of the party was there.
*  Everybody had a big smile on their face.
*  Joey's here.
*  It would be fun.
*  But it took him a while.
*  What it was, was getting his heart broken by deals that didn't happen, agents that didn't
*  follow through, managers that fucked him up or fucked him over.
*  And then he eventually was like, fuck these people, fuck these people.
*  And he just brought that energy on stage.
*  He thought it was over.
*  He thought, I don't have a career.
*  I'm probably going back to prison.
*  I just got out of prison.
*  When I met Joey, he was not out of prison very long.
*  No.
*  I mean, when did he come to LA?
*  96, 97?
*  Somewhere around that.
*  I know I was on news radio because Joey would come visit me on the set and they would be
*  like, who's this fucking criminal?
*  He was eating all the shrimp.
*  Like, leave him alone.
*  He would go into VIP because the VIPs had their own separate green room.
*  And they actually could watch the performance from the green room, I think, in one of the
*  sets.
*  So anyway, they had really good food because it was network executives.
*  So they had shrimp cocktail.
*  That's when Hollywood was alive.
*  You got Joey Diaz, this fucking savage.
*  And Joey was like, building a football player back then too.
*  Joey wasn't like big belly Joey.
*  Joey was like 235, 240 pounds, jacked, big Cuban dude.
*  He was kind of street, kind of sketchy, a little scary.
*  Like high energy, 35 year old Joey.
*  And so they were like, who the fuck is this guy?
*  That's so funny.
*  That's a great image though.
*  It just took something happened to Joey.
*  It was right around the time we got big too, where his belly got big.
*  He just didn't give a fuck about anything anymore.
*  And he figured out a way to just beat that guy who he was in the parking lot on stage.
*  And he did it like that.
*  He did it like that.
*  Theo Vaughn did it like that.
*  Theo Vaughn, I remember that.
*  Did it like that.
*  Now I remember his break for sure.
*  In the beginning it was like, God, this guy's funny, but it's so weird.
*  The act is weird.
*  He seems awkward, but interesting.
*  He was trying to please too many people or something.
*  Or trying to be something he wasn't.
*  And then once he started being himself, unbelievable.
*  It was just finding that authenticity.
*  And that's exactly what we're talking about with these hosts in New York.
*  When they do all these sets.
*  If you can get a job hosting, I know it doesn't pay anything and you're committed to it all
*  night long.
*  If you're a comic, you can definitely make more money on the road.
*  That is, there's something to that in terms of like training sessions.
*  First of all, you have to start the show, which is death.
*  I always tell those guys at the mothership, for the first five minutes you're doing a job.
*  Yep, a real job.
*  A real job.
*  For the first five minutes you're massaging people's feet.
*  You're like fucking washing hair.
*  You're fucking polishing people's nails.
*  You're doing a job.
*  It's not as simple as you just doing your act.
*  You gotta get the audience hypnotized.
*  You gotta get them hypnotized to laugh.
*  When I open for Dice, that's how it is.
*  It's a cold, you just go out there.
*  Sometimes people are like, are you gonna introduce yourself?
*  I'm like, what kind of assholes?
*  Calvin was at the Irvine Improv once and I opened for him, just for fun.
*  Just cold open.
*  Just went out there and performed.
*  It was hard.
*  It was fun.
*  It was a good time.
*  It was fun.
*  But it was like, whoa, we're jumping right into this.
*  It's a little easier because they were happy to see me.
*  But if it was not that sort of situation, you're unknown, and you're not the person
*  that people came to see, they're like, all right, what do we got here?
*  And if you're a chick.
*  Oh, forget it.
*  I've always said this and I think this needs to be recognized.
*  Women are limited in the way the audience is willing to perceive them, right off the
*  bat.
*  You have to break through boundaries in order for them to take you even remotely seriously.
*  You start off, if a man starts off at zero, a woman goes on stage, she starts off at negative
*  three minimum.
*  Immediately.
*  Immediately.
*  If a guy sees a girl go on stage, how many guys like your brother?
*  If he sees a girl walk on stage, they're like.
*  With Dice, they look at me when I come out, they're like, is this a sacrifice?
*  Who's this?
*  But now they know me.
*  But once you're proven, they're like, oh, okay.
*  But it's a harder gig.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a harder gig for a woman.
*  And then women have these two other boundaries.
*  If you talk about sex, then people think you're a slut and they disrespect you, right?
*  Or you can talk about how men suck.
*  You can talk about a few things.
*  You can't talk about politics.
*  You start talking about politics to a bunch of men like, shut the fuck up.
*  I got opinions, too.
*  They'll just start yelling at you.
*  Bullshit.
*  That's fucking Russia collusion and the Steele dossier.
*  They'll start yelling at you like facts and things.
*  You can't talk politics.
*  It goes back to the 50s.
*  Like, who are you?
*  Why are you speaking?
*  What is wrong with you?
*  If you're a guy, you can do political humor.
*  There's not a lot of female political satirists.
*  Think of all the Mark Sauls and the Lenny Bruces.
*  It goes back to the 60s.
*  How many women would you put in the political satirist category?
*  Right.
*  I mean, now Roseanne.
*  Roseanne.
*  Roseanne was kind of like forced into that.
*  They forced her into that.
*  True.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's not, well, it's political in that we talk about like abortion and stuff
*  like that.
*  I shouldn't say she was forced into that because that was one of the issues that they had with
*  her when she was on that show is that she loved Trump.
*  Right.
*  She got fired for it.
*  She got fired for her opinion.
*  She got fired because she was ambient up.
*  Oh, right.
*  She made some tweets about the lady from the government that looks like the lady from the
*  Planet of the Apes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And she didn't know that that lady was black.
*  She thought that lady was Jewish.
*  And she talks about it on stage.
*  She's like, I thought that bitch was Jewish.
*  And if you look at her, you get it.
*  She's very light skinned and she has straight hair.
*  And you know, unfortunately, the joke that she was making, the only reason why she could
*  make that joke is because it kind of works.
*  Right.
*  Like, you know.
*  It's pretty accurate.
*  Right.
*  But it's not, she was just an old lady who has mental health issues, who's on Ambien
*  and a host of other drugs.
*  And people wanted to ruin her life for something she didn't even fucking remember doing.
*  That's the crazy part.
*  Bro, they dope people up with all kinds of wild shit.
*  And then they make you responsible for what you did when you were on that wild shit.
*  That seems so crazy.
*  Ambien's the fucking scariest to me.
*  Kevin James made a turkey.
*  I think it was a turkey.
*  He made a meal and then woke up in the morning, saw the plate of food.
*  It's like, what the fuck?
*  He thought someone broke into his house and cooked.
*  He didn't remember anything.
*  I was living with Dice when he was on Ambien.
*  It was brutal.
*  He would move the car in the middle of the night.
*  We thought it got stolen one time and here he parked it in front of somebody's driveway.
*  So they towed it.
*  But he moved the fucking car.
*  I'm like, dude.
*  He would wake me up as these characters.
*  He was, listen, it's enough to live with Dice.
*  I don't need extra characters.
*  He would wake you up as characters.
*  He would do this black guy.
*  I forgot his name.
*  He would do this military guy.
*  It's always, hey, wake up.
*  And I'm like, ah, my father's back.
*  What?
*  You know, like crazy.
*  So funny.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So funny.
*  He would do some crazy shit.
*  So I believe Kevin doing that.
*  Andrew would eat wild stuff.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  People do that.
*  These people have been in shootouts with the cops.
*  He got off it.
*  Thank God.
*  Is Kevin off it?
*  I do not know.
*  Isn't there someone who drove to his in-laws' house and killed them with a crowbar?
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Like something crazy.
*  Some guy did something crazy on Ambien.
*  That's Ambien and anger mixed together.
*  The thing is, it's like you could take a person who's not that smart and maybe has a real
*  problem with their in-laws.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Maybe the father and him have even gone to blows.
*  That shit happens.
*  Too many picnics, too many Bud Lights.
*  Next thing you know, dudes are duking it out.
*  Here's Sleepwalker, acquitted of murdering mother-in-law after 15-mile drive.
*  Wow.
*  What?
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  I look how we're so ghetto.
*  We have to, we can't even look through the LA Times.
*  Well, just they nickel.
*  They're nickel and diming everybody.
*  You have to pay for everything.
*  It's like.
*  Toronto, a man was acquitted of murdering.
*  Oh, it's Canada.
*  Oh, it's Toronto.
*  It's Canada.
*  It's Toronto.
*  They're living in Narnia up there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  A man was acquitted of murdering his mother-in-law after saying he was sleepwalking when he drove
*  15 miles to her house and hit her with an iron bar and repeatedly stabbed her.
*  Ontario Supreme Court deliberated nine hours before finding Kenneth Parks nearby pickering,
*  not guilty, on Thursday.
*  What about Ambien, though?
*  More, they tried to hit you again.
*  Is that what he was drinking?
*  Joke Co. whatever that is.
*  Does it say Ambien?
*  Does it say it's just sleepwalking?
*  It just said sleepwalking, right?
*  Because he's in a sleep state.
*  There is a, my nephew's a sleepwalker.
*  But was this guy on Ambien?
*  Does it have anything to do with Ambien or is it a different story?
*  Well, that's what I typed in and that's what popped up.
*  Let me see if another story.
*  There was something about a guy.
*  That's so crazy, though.
*  Who drove, maybe I fucked the story up.
*  It seems like that's pretty similar.
*  It's so similar, it seems like I might have fucked the story up.
*  But also, this happened in 1987, so I don't, was Ambien even around then?
*  Oh, wow.
*  No, this is not that story then.
*  It's definitely a more recent story.
*  Yeah, because no, this is a story while I was a grod ass man.
*  Living in Los Angeles, it happened, I remember.
*  I don't remember what, I thought it happened in America.
*  No, it might have been Canada.
*  Canada is silly.
*  They are silly.
*  It's like if you let your cousin, who's like 17, run the house while you go out of town
*  for a week and then you come back home, you're like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  That's Canada.
*  Local cases involving man who shot at five people, test Ambien Defense in court.
*  That's a recent one, huh?
*  That's 2023.
*  Oh, shit.
*  So what is this guy trying to say?
*  He shot at five people while he was on Ambien.
*  Oh, wow.
*  He said, no member of the shooting, two random cars in the middle of the night four years ago.
*  He's probably telling the truth.
*  And I know Roseanne is telling the truth.
*  I know she's telling the truth.
*  She was on Ambien and she was smoking weed.
*  I don't know if she was drinking alcohol, but listen, Roseanne likes to party.
*  But also, she likes to party and she's hard drunk.
*  She's drinking and doing it.
*  That's a real dangerous combo.
*  Everybody should understand this because you kind of know, but you really need to know.
*  And I talked to there's one of the reasons why I had Roseanne on my podcast right after
*  she got in trouble.
*  I wanted everybody to know what I know.
*  Roseanne got hit by a car when she was 15 years old and she spent nine months in a mental
*  health institute.
*  And she was a child.
*  She couldn't count after that.
*  She had straight A's in math.
*  After that, she couldn't do math.
*  Wow.
*  She was fucked up.
*  And that wild impulsiveness led to an amazing career as a stand-up comedian that probably
*  came at least somewhat, some part of it came, obviously came out of her creativity and her
*  performance and her work ethic and all the good things that are funny.
*  She's awesome.
*  But that wildness is part of that injury.
*  That wildness exists in football players.
*  It exists in former fighters.
*  It exists in, there's a lot of people that are running around out there that have brain
*  injuries and if you get someone a brain injury and then you dope them up with Ambien and
*  then marijuana and then who knows what the fuck out.
*  You're taking ketamine and wrecking.
*  Fox News.
*  She's just mainline in Fox News.
*  She's just fuck her.
*  Tower seven.
*  Tower seven.
*  She's just taking it.
*  You have a device that you can tell everybody what you're feeling in that moment.
*  That's crazy.
*  And you're, you know, it's like you're trying to get responses out of people.
*  See what the people think.
*  It's almost like testing an audience for some people.
*  If they don't understand how to manage it, like psychologically, how many comics have
*  we seen just get addicted to like being on Twitter all day?
*  Like get out of there, man.
*  You're losing your life in that box.
*  It's insane.
*  I don't know how people do it.
*  It's so bad for you.
*  I'm a little addicted to TikTok.
*  Yeah, TikTok.
*  Is this an intervention?
*  No, it's not.
*  Just kidding.
*  But I think I wonder if TikTok is, I wonder if it's better for you to just scroll at videos
*  of things happening that are nonsense.
*  Sometimes there's news, but.
*  But maybe that's better because that doesn't like, I don't have TikTok, but I have Instagram
*  and Instagram does not make me feel the way that Twitter makes me feel.
*  Twitter makes me feel like I'm watching a fight between cats.
*  Like it's a cat fight in a house.
*  I just want to get the fuck out of here.
*  I don't want to be a part of this.
*  And it's also like a very poor, it's a very clearly poor management of time and resources.
*  If you're using your time and resources to argue constantly on Twitter, but your life
*  has to be a mess.
*  It has to be a mess.
*  It's impossible for you to only be disciplined in this area where you like contain yourself
*  in this area.
*  The rest of your life, though, everything's locked down.
*  You don't have any problems.
*  But when you go after Twitter, it doesn't affect you.
*  It doesn't affect the rest of your life.
*  Bullshit.
*  Bullshit.
*  You're fighting with the invisible man, but that stuff is out there forever.
*  It's out there forever.
*  And it's also just a, it's 100% proof that you are engaging in a foolish waste of your
*  resources.
*  Exactly.
*  100% undeniable proof.
*  Dice would have been in as much trouble as Roseanne if Twitter was, it might have been
*  a thing, but he probably didn't know how to use it.
*  But no, because we, it's been 20 years.
*  How long has Twitter been out?
*  Well, he was here.
*  He'd been so many controversies.
*  But I'm saying with the ambient.
*  People expect it from Dice, though.
*  Maybe.
*  They didn't, Roseanne was like America's blue collar sweetheart for the longest time when
*  she was on TV.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  She was beloved.
*  I was going to say she did some shit.
*  The national anthem.
*  Who knows what she was on back then?
*  Right, right, right, right.
*  Listen, this lady, they've been medicating this lady left and right her whole life.
*  And she's always, she's always like, I don't know if they got the formula right this time.
*  Let's move it around a little.
*  She's still working it.
*  She's still working it.
*  And listen.
*  So good.
*  She's got a lot of money and I'm sure those doctors.
*  God bless her.
*  I'm sure those doctors are helping out.
*  But you know, like they were telling her at one point in time that they were threatening
*  her royalties.
*  That if she kept talking about things.
*  How is that possible?
*  It's her show.
*  Yeah, but they can do things.
*  They can pull deals.
*  See, like if you're not making any money anymore, but you own a piece of a television show.
*  And also we're dealing with, it's 2024.
*  I'm not in the TV business anymore, but I kind of know how it works.
*  In 2024, I don't know how many people are buying old sitcoms.
*  I'm sure like Netflix and streaming sites, maybe they could do.
*  But if they just decide, you know, hey, we don't want Roseanne on the platform.
*  Like there's shows you can't get.
*  Yeah, like 90s sitcoms.
*  You can't find Grace Under Fire.
*  Try finding that show.
*  No, and I love that.
*  I loved her.
*  I should say she used to work at the store.
*  She was wild, but she was funny.
*  I think towards the end of her tenure there, she might have fucking lost the plot.
*  She got I remember her showing up.
*  She was crazy.
*  I heard she's got a little little nuts and she had substance problems.
*  Yeah, you can tell.
*  It's a very funny comic too.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  She would call and ask me to do her like bizarro favors at the store.
*  And favors?
*  Yeah, like just to see if certain comics were there.
*  She would have like crushes on certain comics.
*  So she's like, hey, so call me if they come in.
*  I'm like, oh, I was like, are you coming in?
*  Because you're like hilarious.
*  You're one of the ones I laugh at.
*  So are you coming in?
*  Then she just stopped coming.
*  But I think she did have some.
*  But there's a thing called TV land, which goes way back, I believe, because I have like
*  nieces and nephews that are like, Jersey, I love Lucy.
*  I'm like, yeah, reruns.
*  They're like, it's my favorite show.
*  But they watch it now on like TV land.
*  Is TV land?
*  I think it's a channel or could be on an app.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't keep up with the kids.
*  I think most I still have cable.
*  It's why I don't own a house.
*  But most things have to be both now.
*  Like you can't just be a channel anymore.
*  You kind of have to be a chair and an app.
*  I think you're right.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're just a channel, they've merged with the.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, my niece is watch the oldest shows and, you know, I don't see like nobody comes
*  up and says like the bunker.
*  What's that called?
*  Archie, All in the Family.
*  All in the Family.
*  That's my favorite.
*  But people don't say that one to me.
*  So I wonder if that's available.
*  But it's definitely available because people send me little videos like Instagram.
*  You see the clips on Tiktok.
*  Yeah, you see them on Tiktok.
*  I don't use that Chinese spyware.
*  I will get out of it.
*  My spyware to be American.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Good for you.
*  I want people in this country sneaking around in my data and finding out what I'm researching.
*  I'm so lonely.
*  I want them all to know where I'm at.
*  At every moment.
*  Come on over, guys.
*  Let's go.
*  Bring it on, bitches.
*  Yeah, it's just weird.
*  It's Tiktok.
*  My nieces were like, you have to get on Tiktok.
*  So I did, but I stink at it.
*  I don't know how to excel at it.
*  I do watch the videos, though.
*  Well, you've got to be trans.
*  First of all.
*  Hey.
*  Can you at least fake it?
*  No, it's not fair.
*  I wanted to transition when I was a kid, and my mom wouldn't let me.
*  I begged.
*  I begged.
*  I think I was like seven or eight.
*  I wanted to be a male bodybuilder.
*  Really?
*  And my mom was like, what?
*  Imagine if that was around today and you lived in Santa Monica.
*  Oh, I would be halfway somewhere, at least, if I was a kid now.
*  Yeah, I'd have one nut maybe.
*  Half a kit.
*  We'll see.
*  But I'm saying, I begged.
*  I told my mom I took a picture out of a male bodybuilder's magazine.
*  Wow.
*  I ripped it out, and I was like, this is what I want.
*  And my mom was like, the guy?
*  I was like, no, I want to be a male bodybuilder.
*  And I didn't know transition.
*  I just said I want to be a boy.
*  And she was so mad because she had four boys in a row,
*  and she begged for a little girl.
*  And then I came out, and I'm like, what's up, motherfucker?
*  How much of that you what's up motherfuckers
*  was affected by the fact that you have all those brothers?
*  Sure, just surround.
*  I didn't know any difference.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Because my little sister, Edie, she's not girly by any means,
*  but she's not as butchy as I was.
*  But she still played the sports and stuff and fought, whatever.
*  But we were just surrounded.
*  The two of us, if we had dolls, they'd rip their heads off.
*  So I'd be like, oh, cool.
*  It looks better.
*  And then we color it in and just do dumb shit.
*  So I don't remember girly stuff.
*  I know my mom would beg me to do it or wear a dress.
*  And then I played Rumble Fumble in my communion dress.
*  She was pissed.
*  Well, just the amount of boy behavior,
*  and you're trying to fit in, and you're the youngest.
*  Yeah.
*  And not the youngest.
*  Well, at the time.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I remember this boy saying to me,
*  because I liked boys, but I was very boy-might.
*  How many older brothers do you have?
*  I have five older brothers.
*  OK.
*  So when you were born, you're born into a home with five boys.
*  Surrounded.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy people.
*  So that's the early developmental time
*  where you're forming your view of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you don't-
*  You have no evidence that girls are even real for years.
*  For years, you're like, why am I-
*  My sisters didn't talk to me.
*  Why am I not like these?
*  I did.
*  I had to share a room with my sisters.
*  And my mom put this big canopy bed in there,
*  and it's a little tiny row home.
*  And the middle room is like a glorified closet.
*  And so she put this canopy bed in there.
*  You could barely open the door.
*  And then when I slept in that, I wet the bed for a long time.
*  So they kicked me out.
*  Oh my god.
*  So I had to sleep in my brother's room.
*  So there was seven of us in the front room.
*  I don't know why I'm pointing like it's over there.
*  But you know what I'm saying.
*  So now I'm in the room with that, and that's all I know.
*  That's it.
*  So I'm doing everything they do.
*  I'm playing football.
*  I'm outside with a helmet.
*  Is she slow?
*  No, she's got a game.
*  And you know what I mean?
*  I was joking on the, I did the R U Garbage podcast
*  with those guys.
*  They're so funny.
*  And I remembered a story because they were asking questions.
*  And I remembered when I would play handball or stickball,
*  I'd take my shirt off and tuck it in the back of my pants
*  and spit and everything.
*  No, shirt.
*  And my mother saw me.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  But I was eight or something.
*  I don't know.
*  I was like, that's what they do.
*  Isn't it funny that a woman's nipples mean something?
*  Why?
*  Yeah.
*  It's very funny.
*  I mean, it's so odd because even a woman that
*  has the smallest of breasts, her nipples are like,
*  you can see them.
*  It literally is the same form as a young boy.
*  If you have a 13-year-old boy and a very thin woman who
*  has no breasts, they're very similar.
*  But one of them, when you realize it's a woman,
*  you're like, oh, isn't that crazy?
*  It is weird.
*  It is.
*  You're essentially literally looking at the same organ,
*  the same part of the body.
*  Same exact thing.
*  It's not like you're looking at a vagina or a dick.
*  Yeah, those are significantly different.
*  You're just looking at nipples.
*  Female nipples make you go, oh.
*  Because there's a slight drop behind it?
*  I don't know.
*  Have you seen the hack these hoes have
*  how to do on Instagram?
*  What?
*  They breastfeed fake babies.
*  You can breastfeed.
*  So they got a rubber baby.
*  And these hotties are pulling out giant melons.
*  And they shake them in front of the audience and squeeze them.
*  And then they stuff them in the face of a fake baby.
*  And this one girl, she's got her other tit out too.
*  Like, fuck it.
*  What if he gets hungry on the other side?
*  So she's got both tits out.
*  And it's a fake baby?
*  Fake tits too.
*  Big, giant-ass fake tits and fake baby.
*  You're allowed to do it because you're
*  allowed to show breastfeeding for educational purposes.
*  Oh, so this is how I'm going to get more followers, Joe.
*  You just gave me the insight.
*  These hoes are scandalous.
*  They know.
*  Check out my new TikTok.
*  They know.
*  Wow.
*  I don't know if it's a TikTok thing.
*  I bet it'll probably get you kicked off TikTok.
*  There.
*  Here they go.
*  Oh, look at the baby.
*  Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
*  That fake baby and the big ass fake today.
*  There's a lot of fake things on there.
*  What a filter, by the way.
*  This one's not a lot of attention.
*  That's the one I'd watch with the football, like an idiot.
*  There's quite a few of these going around.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Glad you knew about that.
*  The most obvious.
*  That's a shitty fake baby.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  That's a dead baby.
*  That's a doll.
*  Your baby's dead.
*  Your milk is poisonous, lady.
*  There's some people that get really good fake babies.
*  Wow.
*  You have to look at the baby real close.
*  I think that's a rubber baby.
*  So they're just getting away with showing their tits.
*  Got it.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  I think, essentially, it's an ad for OnlyFans.
*  I was going to say, yeah.
*  Oh, god.
*  So that's somebody's fetish.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's just the fact that they get to show their tit.
*  I don't even think it's someone's fetish.
*  It's probably definitely someone's fetish.
*  Let's be clear.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone, out of all the freaks in the world,
*  some guys out there jerking off to women breastfeeding,
*  for sure.
*  But it's not that.
*  It's just an opportunity to show your tits.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  But now, my boobs are starting to grow.
*  I don't know why.
*  How?
*  Late in life.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if it's hormonal.
*  I don't know.
*  But for years, nothing.
*  And now, all of a sudden, I'm like, this doesn't fit.
*  What's happening?
*  So I'm going to start.
*  These guys just came in.
*  I didn't even know I was a girl.
*  Let them go.
*  Free the nipple.
*  That was another thing in New York City
*  where they were legally arguing that women
*  I've seen the protest.
*  Should be able to walk around Topolis,
*  because men can walk around Topolis.
*  I saw a protest in Asheville one time.
*  And I was having lunch with Carl LaBeau.
*  We were doing a festival down there.
*  And it was packed.
*  And we were both like, I'm not gay,
*  but watching them flap while you're walking.
*  I was like, oh, wow.
*  That's what they're supposed to look like.
*  And then Carl's just on the floor like, holy shit.
*  I'm going to move here.
*  Isn't it interesting that that's controversial?
*  That there's laws that will tell you.
*  So look, if there's laws about a man exposing himself
*  in public, that makes sense,
*  because that's like a public health danger.
*  And it's danger because the vast majority
*  of sexual predators, especially for younger people,
*  are men, right?
*  So a guy with his dick out in public
*  is like a public safety hazard.
*  A woman with her tits out is really, no one's scared.
*  Well, it's because of the predators probably.
*  Trying to keep them off?
*  That's my point.
*  That's my point.
*  It's the only time where a law is in that,
*  where you don't have any fear whatsoever
*  about that person harming someone with their body,
*  but yet you make their body a crime.
*  You make showing parts of their body a crime.
*  Like you get a ticket or you get,
*  I think they could probably even arrest you
*  for public nudity, in decent exposure.
*  But meanwhile, I could walk right next to that lady
*  with my shirt off and there's no problems at all.
*  But didn't, before, I think the men got the right
*  to take their shirt off, wasn't until like the 50s or 40s.
*  For a long time, they weren't allowed to either.
*  Is that real?
*  I believe so.
*  That's hilarious.
*  So what'd they do on construction sites?
*  What, they just arrest everybody?
*  I, what do you mean?
*  They can't be shirtless at a construction site.
*  That's a job.
*  You can't wear, you can't be shirtless.
*  They only were shirtless
*  when they were having lunch maybe, but.
*  Have you ever worked at a construction site?
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  Wait a minute.
*  Are you talking crazy?
*  Have you ever seen them in the vest and the shirt?
*  Maybe today.
*  Because I'd sit there and watch for a long time
*  if that was true.
*  Maybe today, in the major cities.
*  Yeah, if we were working outside,
*  like I did mostly construction jobs
*  when I was in high school.
*  Okay.
*  So my stepfather was an architect,
*  so I got a lot of jobs on building sites.
*  And so I'd just get jobs as a laborer.
*  That was a good job to get
*  because you could always get them in there.
*  It's hard work.
*  You would be outside topless constantly.
*  91, court lets stand law bearing topless men.
*  Supreme Court Monday lets stand a local ordinance
*  prohibiting, this is in Washington,
*  prohibiting males from jogging topless
*  or otherwise appearing in public without wearing shirts.
*  The court refused to review the constitutionality
*  of a statute from the village of Southampton, New York
*  making it illegal for anyone to appear
*  on a public street shirtless.
*  That's a very specific area.
*  So that's like, this is Southampton, New York.
*  It's what they're talking about.
*  I know when I lived in Boston,
*  when we were working in the summer,
*  we always had shirts off.
*  You get a great tan.
*  I can see it as a roofer, of course,
*  like things like that, but like, I don't know.
*  I'm just picturing maybe people.
*  It's fucking hot.
*  Of course, it's crazy hot.
*  It's hot, you're carrying lumber
*  and the building that you're building has no ventilator,
*  it has nothing, it's just frames.
*  You're basically helping carpenters frame things.
*  Sure, in my head I'm seeing them like right now
*  with the vest on, but maybe that's just my fantasy.
*  The summertime no shirt is easy.
*  The hard one is wintertime no heat.
*  Because I had wintertime no heat gigs.
*  Whoa, those were rough.
*  Especially in Boston.
*  Yeah, I had some of those right after I graduated
*  from high school, they were a wake up call.
*  Because like, hey fuckface, you gotta figure out
*  what you wanna do with your life
*  or this is gonna be you forever.
*  Being in the winter with numb feet,
*  moving shit around on a construction site.
*  Fingers being frozen, I hate that.
*  We would have a little public portable heater
*  that we would all gather around to eat lunch.
*  So you'd all stand around this blowtorch
*  while you're eating lunch.
*  Oh my God, so dangerous but amazing.
*  It wasn't really a blowtorch.
*  It's like, you ever seen one of those?
*  They have them on set sometimes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're hot.
*  Chappelle and I did Fear Factor.
*  I did Fear Factor on the Chappelle show.
*  So I came in and Tyrone Biggums was on Fear Factor.
*  Hey Joe Rogan, I remember.
*  They filmed that in the dead of winter in New York
*  in this warehouse, like this space,
*  whatever they were filming at.
*  And they had one of them heaters.
*  So they would have them on set sometimes.
*  Got it.
*  It's like this big tube.
*  Yeah, I vaguely remember.
*  You basically can cook a grilled cheese sandwich
*  in front of it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You can light on fire.
*  Very dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  So we would gather around in front of one
*  of those fucking things.
*  And just be like.
*  Just freezing our dicks off
*  and then go right back out there.
*  Carrying the cement, carrying the lumber.
*  That was your motivation.
*  Well, it was just a wake up call.
*  You don't want to be doing no hard labor, son.
*  But the point is we could have no shirts on
*  and walk around, no one cared.
*  But if we were a bunch of gals framing rooftops
*  with our tits out, all the local hens.
*  You could wear the bra.
*  That's why girls now think they'll just wear a bra.
*  They didn't want to wear a bra.
*  They just wanted to let their tits out like a guy does.
*  All the local hens.
*  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
*  Put your tits on, you dirty bitch.
*  You fucking dirty bitch.
*  My husband's looking at your dirty tits.
*  Sometimes I'll see on Melrose and stuff.
*  You see him walking around
*  and they have these short shorts.
*  One time me and Andrew were just at Starbucks
*  hanging out on Melrose in LA.
*  And these kids were walking by.
*  I mean, they were kids.
*  And he just turned away.
*  And I go, what happened?
*  And it was a girl.
*  Her entire ass was out.
*  The shorts were all the way out.
*  And he just turned away like, that's a baby.
*  I'm not looking at that.
*  Classic.
*  Yeah, I know, I know.
*  But that's what they do.
*  I don't know if that's a teenage thing.
*  Well, I mean, I think that's again,
*  there's always been girls that dress like that
*  or close to that, right?
*  You can go way back to the 80s.
*  I tried.
*  I wore cute little hot pants in the 80s.
*  Yeah, I used to wear a bustier.
*  Because I started clubbing like when I was 14.
*  Oh my God, Eleanor.
*  What a fucking background.
*  Perfect background to be a comic.
*  True.
*  Well, once that, this is what happened with the boy,
*  like me wanting to be a boy, I liked boys.
*  And this one really good looking kid that played football,
*  he was like, and I'm like standing there.
*  I remember like I'm wearing shoulder pads, idiot.
*  And he goes, are you ever gonna be a girl?
*  And I was like, oh.
*  And then I asked another guy friend, I go,
*  how come so-and-so doesn't like me?
*  And they're like,
*  because he thinks you could beat him up.
*  Nobody's attracted to the girl
*  who may or may not be able to knock him out.
*  So I stopped.
*  And I was like, oh.
*  And then boys started to like me and I was like, oh.
*  You had to learn a new pattern of behavior.
*  Yes, but I still am like, watch it.
*  Like when guys start wearing cologne.
*  Right.
*  Like, oh, okay, I'm gonna clean up, I stink.
*  Yeah, I still am like not so grateful to be a woman.
*  Like it bothers me a lot.
*  Because I still have that in me.
*  Like it would be so much easier to just be a dude.
*  Do you think they could have talked you into being trans
*  if you were like 12?
*  Absolutely, 100%.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  And I'm good friends with Dylan Mulvaney.
*  We did a pilot together.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Dylan was not trans when I met them.
*  How do you say it?
*  I don't know.
*  Be careful.
*  You're gonna get in trouble.
*  She knows I love her, so I can't say anything wrong.
*  So you knew her when she was a he.
*  Right, and we had the best time.
*  But meeting her, when I did, I was like,
*  oh, she's more woman than I ever was, ever will be.
*  Like I know I have the parts.
*  Even with a dick.
*  I'm telling you, more girly than, I mean girly, girly.
*  And my best friend growing up was like that.
*  You're a very kind person.
*  You're a very kind person.
*  And I just wanna introduce this thought into your mind.
*  People are performative occasionally.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  And sometimes when people want you to think of them
*  in one way or another, they will behave that way.
*  And people can keep that up for.
*  I didn't know them from anybody.
*  We just met.
*  Right.
*  So you're saying she was performing.
*  Well, I think deciding that you're a woman
*  and then performing like a woman,
*  it is a thing that we can all do.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  And if you met me, Eleanor, if you met me,
*  and you're like, oh my God, Joe Rogan is a woman.
*  Thinks like a woman, behaves like a woman,
*  has off this woman energy, so sweet, so amazing.
*  It's performative.
*  I see.
*  You're a biological man.
*  Well, you don't think you could be.
*  And there's a lot of social value in being trans today.
*  I agree with you on that.
*  You get attention for having nothing interesting about you
*  other than the fact that you're a boy
*  who wants to be a girl.
*  That's it.
*  And that is like a crazy low barrier to entry
*  to be a part of a protected class and to be celebrated
*  for people that will never be celebrated.
*  But you don't believe people can be born
*  and have like mixed up things.
*  I do.
*  I believe both things.
*  I believe both things.
*  This is what we have to be wary about
*  because when you see these cluster cases,
*  like particularly young girls,
*  we get like 10 girls that are on the spectrum
*  and they all go trans in the school together.
*  That's crazy.
*  And you have to realize that people are motivated
*  just like you were when you were a young girl
*  and you were dressing like a boy and acting like a boy.
*  And then you go, oh, I gotta not do that anymore.
*  And then now boys like me.
*  People are motivated by behaviors
*  that get them positive reinforcement.
*  In this time, in this day and age,
*  there's immense amount of positive reinforcement
*  of being a part of the LBGT, Pride, whatever it is,
*  movement.
*  And that makes sense because it's a natural reaction
*  to the times when we were kids
*  where gay people were shunned and shit on.
*  And it was up until 2013,
*  Hillary Clinton was saying that she didn't think
*  that marriage should be between gay men.
*  It should be between a man and a woman.
*  Barack Obama used to say that.
*  They all used to say it.
*  So imagine being a gay person,
*  and so there's like this natural overcorrection.
*  So we're in this overcorrection right now.
*  But this overcorrection gets co-opted by opportunists
*  who are just narcissists, just people with mental illness
*  and people who realize that they can get
*  a tremendous amount of attention
*  by just fitting into this new play.
*  And it's also a great way for perverts and sex offenders
*  Yeah, you see that a lot too.
*  to weasel in.
*  Isn't it like, if you were a guy
*  and you were really into dogs,
*  you'd get a job as a dog trainer.
*  Okay. Right?
*  Guy's really into dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  He loves working with dogs.
*  If you're a pedophile,
*  wouldn't you get a job at Nickelodeon?
*  Right.
*  You would, right? Yeah.
*  Well, isn't there like a scandal that's going on right now?
*  Yeah, bad. Real bad.
*  What is the Nickelodeon scandal?
*  The Dan guy.
*  I mean, I don't even know if it's that,
*  there's another one too.
*  Oh, really? A new one?
*  I just like kids.
*  I just like working with kids.
*  I just like being around them and being alone with them.
*  Priests.
*  Being alone with them. Yeah.
*  I like being alone with them. Teachers, yeah.
*  Just me and the kid.
*  Camp counselors.
*  Shh, let's keep a secret.
*  What the fuck?
*  That's fucked up.
*  But there's humans that recognize
*  that there's like patterns that they can fall into
*  where they can get more attention, get more praise.
*  So this is the Nickelodeon thing.
*  It says, the actor is claimed to be sexually abused
*  by dialogue and acting coach Brian Peck,
*  who pleaded no contest to performing a lewd act
*  with a 14 or 15 year old
*  and to oral copulation with a minor under 16 in 2004.
*  Ultimately sentenced to 16 months in prison
*  and ordered to register as a sex offender in October, 2004.
*  His first interview since the release of the Doc Bell
*  has shared his thoughts on Nickelodeon's response
*  to the allegations.
*  Yeah, I mean, how do you know when someone,
*  I mean, if you hire, you're hoping you're hiring people
*  that just like making kids shows.
*  Maybe they have kids.
*  But why can't the parent be present?
*  Like this kind of shit,
*  like they say kids that get molested and stuff like that,
*  a lot of times it's parents just being like,
*  giving them off, you know, like, and not being present.
*  There was, I mean, I feel,
*  I think about it, I'm like, why didn't we get molested?
*  We were on our own for a long time.
*  I dodged a couple of bullets when I was a kid.
*  Did you really? Yeah.
*  But it's, you're trusting people
*  and most people you can trust
*  and you hope you can trust these people.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know about UFC heavyweight champion,
*  former heavyweight champion Kane Velasquez?
*  What happened?
*  His son was apparently by daycare
*  and he went after the guy and shot at him from his car
*  and got arrested and was in jail for like a year.
*  I think he's still awaiting trial,
*  but it was literally one of those things
*  where everybody that hears that, that's a father,
*  if you ask them, what would you do if that happened?
*  Like they, everyone says the same thing.
*  If you can get away with sleepwalking
*  and killing your mother-in-law,
*  you should be away with fucking blind rage
*  that makes you shoot at some guy who molested your kid.
*  Listen, I don't have children
*  and if that happened to one of my nieces and nephews,
*  I'd be the one who snapped.
*  It's just. I'd lose it.
*  It's the most evil of things.
*  It's disgusting.
*  But it's also, it's one of the weird ones
*  that today they're trying to normalize.
*  They're trying to call it minor attracted persons.
*  When I say they, I want to be really clear.
*  Yeah, it's just a few fringe psychos.
*  But the problem is that fringe psycho dialogue
*  winds up on social media and then gets amplified
*  by places like TikTok that want us
*  to be upset at these kinds of things,
*  whether it's to program us or whether it's just to keep us
*  like fighting and then engaging in the algorithm,
*  which is ultimately beneficial for them
*  because that's really what they want
*  is more views and more interactions.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you'll have these wacky fucking people
*  that give these speeches in public with cameras on them
*  where they're talking about,
*  we have to understand this is an identity
*  and this is a, it should be a protected identity,
*  a minor attracted person.
*  It's like, this is not one person saying this.
*  Yeah.
*  It's multiple people saying this.
*  But it falls into that same thing.
*  Some people are fucking insane.
*  I agree.
*  I agree.
*  My best friend growing up, he was flamboyant from the get.
*  And I mean, we were friends when we were six, seven.
*  So, and he would always be like,
*  and he made me get into cheerleading
*  because he liked cheerleading.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't like cheerleading.
*  And then I was like, can we just do something?
*  Can we play football?
*  And then he started, we would fight
*  and then we always used to say that we wished we had a button
*  or we wanted to, there was a cartoon
*  where you can run into each other,
*  Wonder Powers activate or something like that.
*  We run into each other and you become something different.
*  We were gonna run into each other and become-
*  And you would be a boy in the inch.
*  Yes.
*  Nice.
*  And it never worked.
*  So he waited till both his parents passed
*  and then he transitioned.
*  Oh wow.
*  But he wanted that his whole life.
*  He just didn't wanna disrespect his parents.
*  It's 100% a real thing.
*  It is.
*  The problem is-
*  But I agree that there's always people that jump in and act.
*  There is that and then there's this other thing.
*  The other thing is money.
*  So you have to realize how many gender affirming care clinics
*  have opened up just since 2007.
*  If you look at the map of 2007 versus 2023,
*  it's crazy the difference.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's probably now or in 2024,
*  it's probably even more.
*  But the number of those things that they,
*  by the way, they're just like a body shop.
*  You bring a car into a body shop,
*  they're gonna wanna fix the car.
*  Okay?
*  You bring a kid into a gender affirming care,
*  they're not gonna go,
*  Billy, you just need to find yourself, man.
*  Maybe you're just a gay man.
*  Right.
*  They're not gonna just tell them,
*  like there's a lot of social pressure on this.
*  Sure.
*  And you're very uncomfortable with your own skin
*  and your own life and you're thinking that
*  this is gonna be the solution to make you whole.
*  Right.
*  And also if you're a woman,
*  if they give you testosterone,
*  you are gonna feel better.
*  So the thing about testosterone,
*  it makes them, it alleviates anxiety,
*  it does all sorts of different,
*  it creates a sense of euphoria
*  when girls take it in high doses.
*  And my friend,
*  someone in his immediate vicinity is transitioning
*  from a girl to a boy.
*  And he found out what the dose was,
*  the dose of testosterone.
*  He goes, this is like a hardcore bodybuilder
*  steroid dose of testosterone.
*  Wow.
*  He's like, this person was banging,
*  banging like a lot of tests every week.
*  Holy shit.
*  And it was just changing everything,
*  changing their voice,
*  changing the facial structure,
*  growing a mustache, like weird shit.
*  Like knowing someone their whole life as a girl
*  and then all of a sudden they have a fucking beard.
*  Yeah.
*  What is happening here?
*  So of course it's gonna make you feel different.
*  But is that who you really were?
*  Is that who you really are?
*  That's the hard part.
*  I think of that a lot.
*  Because I think if I did it,
*  if I, how would I feel?
*  Because there are people that do it
*  and then say, I wanna go back.
*  But that's- Yeah, detransitioners.
*  And they get shamed by the way.
*  That's what's really scary.
*  Those people get attacked
*  because they're fucking it up.
*  Because here's the thing,
*  and you just have to look at it like a system.
*  Groups of people always want more people in their group.
*  Always.
*  Like people that use Windows PCs
*  will try to convince you that Apple sucks.
*  Like, they will.
*  I know, I have heard it.
*  I've heard the argument.
*  Now, trans people,
*  unless they're actively trying to reproduce
*  by going to a clinic.
*  So unless you're a trans woman
*  who has a fully functional dick
*  and you're having sex with a trans man
*  who has a fully functional vagina
*  and hasn't taken so much testosterone
*  that they're no longer fertile.
*  And then even so, like what's going on there?
*  But that's like, it's not the regular way
*  that people have kids.
*  So you, and there's no guarantee
*  that you're gonna have a trans kid.
*  So there's only one way to get more trans people.
*  You gotta recruit.
*  Exactly.
*  You gotta recruit.
*  Everybody needs a recruit.
*  If you can't draft, you must recruit.
*  That's what they would say about gay people.
*  They're recruiting.
*  Well, some of them do.
*  Some do.
*  But that's what I'm saying.
*  There's always a percentage.
*  I had this friend who was gay
*  and he would always talk about
*  how we convince straight guys
*  and let them suck their dick.
*  Oh my God, I have so many friends.
*  He loved it.
*  He thought it was so funny.
*  He's like, all these straight guys.
*  Just get them a little drunk
*  and tell them you suck their dick.
*  It's amazing how many of them let you.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  And then there's, I know women
*  that are gay and so forceful.
*  One is like, was so, she would turn women, if you will,
*  for a period of time, date them,
*  drop them like a bad habit.
*  Now they're all fucking confused.
*  They don't know who they are.
*  Am I gay?
*  Am I straight?
*  Who am I?
*  And then go through all these crazy mental breakdowns.
*  I have two really good friends
*  that went crazy over this shit.
*  And I'm like.
*  They got turned out by a lesbian.
*  Turned out and turned down.
*  See ya.
*  Bye bitch.
*  Later.
*  Sometimes lesbians comes as hard as God.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yes, same kind of behavior.
*  Drop you, just cut you off.
*  Also you're recognizing, if you're in that dating game,
*  there's two players in that dating game.
*  It's the strong, successful dominator,
*  which could be a woman.
*  And then there's the person's like,
*  well sure, I'd love to come to work with you.
*  The more demure.
*  It doesn't even have to be male or female.
*  It just has to be, there's guys like that,
*  that wind up with these boss ladies.
*  How many boss ladies do you know
*  that have these really bag of milk husbands?
*  Like these guys have zero will.
*  Such a great line.
*  They just have no will.
*  There's no drive.
*  If someone breaks into their house,
*  they're gonna faint like a possum.
*  There's no animal in there.
*  It's all gone.
*  He's under the covers.
*  You get him, honey.
*  If it wasn't gone because of environmental conditions
*  or biology, it's gone by the circumstances
*  they find themselves in.
*  They have a dominant woman and she yells at them
*  and they get no sex.
*  I try to not be that way, but I have done that.
*  I have, I have done that.
*  Like I remember Andrew Dice getting angry.
*  I always call him Andrew, whatever.
*  When he got angry at me, because there was like a fight,
*  he got an argument with this guy at 7-Eleven.
*  And I got in between and he was just like,
*  what are you doing?
*  And I was like, I'll kill somebody.
*  What?
*  You don't want me to help?
*  Like I thought we were on the same team.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But he got mad and I was like,
*  okay, you gotta calm down with your bruteness.
*  Okay.
*  And not throw a man through something.
*  Because I'm an idiot like that.
*  Again, it comes to growing up with the wrestling.
*  Even when I physically start,
*  really literally start at wrestling,
*  and my mom was like furious at that.
*  What are you doing?
*  We used to love going to watch you.
*  But she was mad.
*  When we saw you at the forum, it was awesome.
*  You're a fucking pro wrestler.
*  It was incredible.
*  It was amazing.
*  I loved it.
*  I was like, this is so good.
*  Yeah, you were really good at it too.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  My mom started giving me notes.
*  Ah, that's hilarious.
*  But it was entertaining.
*  It was very entertaining.
*  That's what it's supposed to be.
*  Yeah.
*  And so yeah, I would have fun.
*  Now I'm physically in the ring fighting with people.
*  She was so embarrassed.
*  But there was a point I was gonna make
*  and I lost it because my brain.
*  No worries.
*  But yeah, it's just, I'm saying that whole trajectory
*  of I'm still doing boy-like things in a girl's body.
*  Right, right.
*  And I do believe where you're saying,
*  my brother Charlie jokingly,
*  talking about like it's hitting everywhere.
*  He went to the doctors and they were asking him questions.
*  And she said, what do you identify as?
*  Now, Charlie's in his 50s.
*  And he goes, the fuck are you talking about?
*  You know what I mean?
*  I know, it's funny when they bring it up out of nowhere.
*  What are your pronouns?
*  What are your pronouns?
*  You can see me, bitch.
*  How do you identify?
*  With your mustache and your gray chest hair.
*  Yeah, he's sitting there, he's rubbing one out.
*  What are you saying?
*  But he looked at her because it's so foreign to him.
*  And the lady apologized.
*  She goes, I'm sorry, I have to ask.
*  Because they-
*  It's like part of the regulations.
*  Yeah, well, it's probably a DEI thing that they have
*  that's attached to their business.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Yeah, well, it's Vivek Ramaswamy,
*  that guy who was running for president.
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  And he said some very interesting things.
*  When he said, he called it the tyranny of the oppressed.
*  He goes, yeah, it's not good to oppress people.
*  Everyone should be free.
*  But it's also not good to give the oppressed
*  so much power that they can just run rampant
*  over everyone else.
*  And everybody has to adhere to their rules
*  because they were at one point in time
*  a part of an oppressed class.
*  And I think that's the overcorrection
*  that we're talking about with the trans stuff.
*  The problem is today, it can be pushed in a way
*  that's so different than when we were kids.
*  When we were kids, if you were a gay guy,
*  you became a priest.
*  Did you have a gay guy in high school that became a priest?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we did.
*  And he's not a pedophile.
*  No, our guy wasn't a pedophile unless he turned into one.
*  But when I knew him, he was a regular kid.
*  He was my friend's sister or my friend's brother.
*  Whoops, Freudian.
*  My friend's brother, they would always talk about,
*  he's going to be a priest.
*  So we were in high school riding the bus together.
*  I think people even back then were calling him father.
*  He was fucking 15.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah, but everyone had it on him.
*  Everyone knew he was going to be a priest.
*  Yeah, my friend that did it, he's now out of it.
*  Of the priesthood or the gayness?
*  The priesthood, he's still gay, still queer as they come.
*  But he left the priesthood, which was weird,
*  because we were like, whoa, is he coming out?
*  Is he this?
*  And he left.
*  And now he just said they were changing too many things.
*  The literal religion messed him up to get him out.
*  Interesting.
*  What were they changing?
*  The Catholic Church, my mom, please,
*  she doesn't know how to listen to the podcast.
*  Anyway, the Catholic Church changes on a dime.
*  Even something, Lent, right now we're in Lent.
*  There were so many rules that my mom had that we don't have,
*  my generation didn't have.
*  And now it's a whole other, Lent is not.
*  Now I'm looking at kids like, what?
*  You could do that?
*  It's Lent.
*  You're not allowed to.
*  You have to do this, this, and this.
*  But they've changed.
*  They just changed so that they can recruit.
*  That's why the Muslims are going to win.
*  They don't give a fuck who joins.
*  Ramadan is you got a month and nobody's eating.
*  All day long, no water, no food.
*  We were in downtown the other day, driving downtown LA,
*  and there's an alleyway.
*  And this dude was in the alleyway.
*  In LA?
*  No, in Austin.
*  Did I say LA?
*  I'm sorry.
*  Downtown Austin.
*  And there was this dude that was in an alleyway,
*  and the sun was going down.
*  So he's praying.
*  I saw that.
*  Wherever the fuck you are, you got to pray.
*  I saw it in New York City.
*  And it's so hard to find a space in New York City.
*  So I was like, wow, that is impressive.
*  That's devotion.
*  Exactly.
*  He was behind a pillar that went into,
*  there was a little bit of room to go into these offices,
*  and he was literally just behind the pillar,
*  just doing that.
*  And I was like, wow, that is right in Times Square.
*  Have you ever seen the one from Toronto?
*  Uh-uh.
*  You want to remember to talk about how wacky Canada is?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Toronto, it was Toronto, right?
*  Call to prayer in the street.
*  It's bananas.
*  Really?
*  The street is filled.
*  They just do the call to prayer,
*  and people just come out of their houses?
*  I don't know where this is.
*  I don't know why they were there.
*  I just saw the video, and I'm like, whoa, this is Canada?
*  It just seems like—
*  Canada's a mess.
*  I don't know if you've been there in a while.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I know they have health care, but it's not working.
*  It's a mess.
*  Their president sucks.
*  They need some sort of no-nonsense president
*  to straighten everything out, or prime minister,
*  or whatever you want to call them.
*  Yeah, the nerve of them to—
*  Get a better king.
*  What you're doing is nuts.
*  Like, every week, there's some new strike on rights and laws
*  and freedom of speech, and they just keep cracking.
*  They stop people from being able to get guns.
*  You can't have a handgun anymore.
*  They're cracking down on all sorts of different things
*  in regards to what constitutes hate speech online,
*  whether or not they can filter your internet access.
*  It's not good.
*  They're homeless?
*  I was in Vancouver.
*  Did you find that video?
*  Oh.
*  It's really crazy.
*  They're in the streets.
*  Yeah, I want to see it.
*  There's thousands of people in the street.
*  This is all I can find is this.
*  It's part of a news—
*  Oh.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Give me this.
*  Look at this.
*  I spotted a protest.
*  Look at this.
*  This isn't in Toronto.
*  This isn't in Toronto.
*  So this is a protest for something.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Yeah, in Toronto.
*  But it's still.
*  It's still—
*  Oh, it's a protest.
*  OK, I thought—
*  Even if it's a protest, you get that many people
*  that are doing that.
*  There's not another religion—
*  That would do that.
*  That would do that.
*  They are so much more devout in their belief.
*  Because they're praying.
*  The Catholics would just wave a cross in your face.
*  They'd do like a half-assed wave.
*  And a lot of people would come out.
*  Father's son always burnt, you know, bulls.
*  The Muslims are out there in the street on their fucking knees.
*  Fuck your traffic.
*  We're praying.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck your traffic.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's a different thing.
*  It's Toronto.
*  It's busy.
*  Yeah.
*  And Toronto and Canada, their approach to immigrants
*  was not assimilate and become a part of America.
*  Right.
*  That's what we do.
*  We're like, become one of us.
*  Become a part of it.
*  Their thing was like, no, keep your culture.
*  Keep your culture and keep it here.
*  OK, what is your culture?
*  Sharia law.
*  Like, what are you guys saying?
*  You know there's parts of the world that
*  are living like the 1200s.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But that doesn't look like that.
*  Like, it's hard to figure out.
*  You look at a priest, you go, pedophile, right?
*  And then you look at a Muslim, you go, terrorist.
*  That's so bad.
*  Again, it's a small portion.
*  See, the thing about the, and it's also our version of it
*  is like, oh, you see them, they're terrorists.
*  Well, why?
*  Yeah.
*  What did we do?
*  What?
*  This is the thing.
*  What was your part in it, little lady?
*  How many bombs have gone off in Yemen?
*  What have we done?
*  What did we do in Iraq?
*  What did we do in Afghanistan?
*  What did we do?
*  Yeah.
*  What did we do to deserve this?
*  Accountability is lost everywhere in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  We are like, what we're doing is like so bonkers
*  all over the world with so many different bases.
*  We're the only country that has bases.
*  How many countries does the United States
*  have military bases in?
*  Let's just take a guess.
*  How many have they had abandoned?
*  Let's take a guess.
*  Let's take a guess.
*  Oh, a guess.
*  Oh, shit.
*  How many active military bases in how many countries?
*  You're trying to see if I'm smart.
*  I see multiple military bases probably
*  exist in some countries of strategic importance.
*  Sure.
*  But if we had to guess, how many countries
*  have US military bases?
*  Let's guess.
*  I'm going to guess countries.
*  I know there's like so many.
*  I'm not smart.
*  I'm going to say 15.
*  15.
*  OK, I'm going to go a little higher.
*  I'm going to say 30.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's probably higher than that.
*  How many countries have US military bases in them?
*  According to Al Jazeera, the number
*  is not published by the Pentagon,
*  but it is known to be around 750 bases in at least 80
*  countries.
*  80.
*  80.
*  Because I was thinking of the main ones that I hear.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine there's 750 Apple stores.
*  I think there is.
*  I got to be honest.
*  In countries that we invade and put an Apple store in.
*  Wow.
*  What is Apple trying to do?
*  Apple and Starbucks side by side.
*  They're everywhere.
*  McDonald's just made it all the way to the Congo.
*  Yeah.
*  That's nuts.
*  80 countries.
*  80 countries and 700.
*  Plus military bases.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you see terrorists, you go, why are they mad at us?
*  Oh, yeah, I never.
*  There's 520 Apple stores.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  There's more military bases in other countries
*  than there are Apple stores.
*  Apple, you're slacking.
*  Get it together.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  Wild.
*  We're a bigger business.
*  And people are still talking about Microsoft?
*  Yeah.
*  The US military is a bigger business than Microsoft.
*  That's why they had to recruit the trans.
*  They're like, we just need bodies.
*  Get that admiral.
*  That fucking dude.
*  Put him in a dress.
*  Put him in a fucking.
*  Make him an admiral.
*  Yeah, get everybody excited.
*  You can become an admiral if you're a girl.
*  You can win woman of the year.
*  Give him woman of the year.
*  Give him woman of the year.
*  Look, I know you're a loser as a guy, but listen.
*  As a woman, you're a winner.
*  Anyway, why don't you just pretend you're a woman
*  for a little bit and move up that goddamn ladder,
*  Leah Thomas.
*  That's what you have to do.
*  Swim it out, bitch.
*  Swim it out.
*  But that's the world we're living in.
*  And then also you have China, which is so much more clever
*  than the United States.
*  They've been around and they've thrived economically
*  for 4,000 years.
*  So China has been infiltrating all of our education systems.
*  Infiltrating, buying up stock and businesses,
*  buying up land.
*  They have their fucking tentacles in the entire system
*  in this country.
*  And they run the most addictive social media app.
*  Like they always, and Adam Curry said this best.
*  He's the original pod father.
*  He's the first podcaster, the guy from MTV.
*  Remember Adam Curry?
*  Oh yeah, that name, yeah.
*  No agenda, podcast.
*  He's the best.
*  I love him.
*  But Adam pointed it out.
*  This is the only time where there's been a thing
*  that the United States makes where China dominates
*  in what is ordinarily thought of as a creative thing.
*  Right.
*  Like tech things.
*  Like for a social media app, TikTok's the most addictive.
*  And he thinks that all of this attacks on TikTok,
*  he's like, they're not doing anything different
*  than we're doing.
*  He goes, all the attacks is all just really designed
*  to shut out the competition or break it up.
*  And then make other countries like China,
*  if they have an app like TikTok,
*  you have to sell to America.
*  And then you're gonna keep doing the same thing.
*  But now we'll have the data.
*  We don't want the data in those other people
*  that are shifty.
*  We want in our shifty people.
*  That's right.
*  We're gonna keep an eye on you.
*  We're shifting our own shit.
*  Use your microphone and look at all your fucking
*  text messages that you send to your friends.
*  Yeah, we wanna see.
*  Check your memes folder for fucking dangerous things.
*  See how much makeup you really have.
*  That's all they do.
*  This guy in Belgium, they sentenced him to a year in jail
*  because he's been sharing racist memes with his friends
*  in a private chat.
*  And then we went and saw the memes.
*  Oh my God.
*  They're like nothing.
*  Oh yeah, mine got out.
*  But I mean, they're nothing in that,
*  they were talking about like Nazi ones.
*  Did we ever find that?
*  The Nazi, we did.
*  We showed it on the show.
*  See if you can find his memes.
*  We found it again, but remember the one had guns in it.
*  We were like maybe it was something to do with the guns.
*  Yeah, there definitely was a gun thing.
*  But the guns one was like they were in another country
*  taking photos with guns and saying something like,
*  we're gonna take back our country
*  or some crazy shit like that.
*  Well anyway, they arrested this dude.
*  But they're allowed to look in your private chats
*  and then sentence you for memes you send your friends.
*  But that's how slippery this shit can get.
*  When you give people control over what you can
*  and can't say, and then you acknowledge
*  that you're getting influenced constantly
*  by foreign governments and foreign agents
*  that are trying to sow the seeds of chaos.
*  Yeah.
*  We're gonna just see what, there's no gun charges,
*  so maybe not, that's what the charges were.
*  Just straight racism.
*  Racism, Holocaust denial in relation to material
*  shared amongst private group chats.
*  Although Van Levergo denies sending the material himself.
*  So he was on the chat.
*  He was on the chat that got all these things shared.
*  But let's see what the actual memes were.
*  I'm trying to find them.
*  I've been trying to find them every time you talk about it.
*  I can't find them again. Really?
*  That's insane.
*  I bet Reddit has it.
*  Or 4chan, I bet 4chan's got it.
*  I don't even know how to look at that website.
*  You don't know how to look up on 4chan?
*  What is it?
*  You a fake internet guy?
*  You know what I do?
*  I call Duncan.
*  By the way, I've- Duncan's on 4chan all day long.
*  No.
*  Hey man, I'll use my burner account.
*  I'll ask the guys.
*  I'm obsessed with Duncan.
*  He's the best.
*  The greatest human being ever.
*  We forced him into being the talent coordinator
*  at the Comedy Store.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's how Duncan and I became friends.
*  Talent coordinator?
*  Yeah, I used to call up and leave my avails.
*  We'd have these crazy conversations about like
*  Alan Watts and like some speech that he gave.
*  He's literally the smartest person in the world.
*  Well, he's a fascinating guy.
*  Because he's so uniquely him.
*  Like Duncan, he's not- he doesn't change who he is
*  to be around like other people.
*  He's just- he's always been this really odd
*  kind of hippie guy.
*  But also like very objective about things.
*  And he'll see like people getting sucked
*  into a certain pattern of thinking.
*  And be like, hey, what?
*  Hold on.
*  Like he'll be one of the first to-
*  And he's really great at satire too.
*  He's really great at pretending.
*  He's really into something.
*  He uses Twitter for that all the time.
*  Like if you look at some of his tweets
*  and you didn't know, you'd think he's serious.
*  Like he says-
*  I read him, I go, this is the greatest.
*  He did one recently, something about the CIA.
*  He's just fucking hilarious.
*  I don't understand how people can't read the sarcasm.
*  Cause they're dumb.
*  I guess you're right.
*  But what he's saying, I'm not smart, but what he's-
*  You had to survive though.
*  You had to develop some kind of smarts.
*  All these brothers.
*  But laughing at what he's saying.
*  Like it's so bizarre that you know it's fucking crazy.
*  Not if you're one of them Illuminati people.
*  Like believes in-
*  Everybody's eating babies and getting an Adrena Chrome.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm looking for those babies.
*  Well, there's a thing, if you're on this podcast,
*  there's a certain group of people
*  that will think you're in with the Illuminati.
*  They would think that I'm in.
*  I'm in?
*  With the Illuminati.
*  I'm here to tell you folks,
*  me, the guy who has the number one podcast in the world,
*  this fucking thing is like, it's all in my head.
*  Me getting text messages, it's all me emailing guys
*  to get them to come on.
*  It's all in my head.
*  There's no CIA.
*  But that's what I would say though,
*  if I was a guy who was like-
*  You're right.
*  Influenced by the NSA and I was like an undercover spy.
*  Sort of like this-
*  So that strip search was normal?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what you got in your posting.
*  You gotta do a cavity search.
*  That was the thing about the rock and roll movement
*  in Laurel Canyon in the 1970s.
*  Eddie Bravo made me read a book on it.
*  I watched the documentary, I think.
*  Yeah, there's like a crazy fucking conspiracy
*  that the CIA created like Jim Morrison, the doors,
*  and the rock and roll movement of the 60s,
*  all the decadent rock and roll.
*  There's weird connections.
*  It's like, you gotta go like, whoa.
*  There are some connections there.
*  Here's the thing.
*  I don't think you can create a Jim Morrison.
*  You need to have a guy who's that guy.
*  But Jim Morrison's dad was like a federal agent.
*  Jim Morrison's dad was, what was Jim Morrison's dad?
*  General.
*  Who's a general?
*  Who's a general?
*  But you gotta have that-
*  Wasn't he in the CIA as well?
*  I don't think so.
*  No, just a general?
*  He was just like the one that gave the orders
*  that started the Gulf of Tonkin or something.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Whoa.
*  Okay, so imagine that.
*  So his dad, deep state, right?
*  So that's a military connection.
*  Okay.
*  Rear Admiral.
*  Yeah, look at that, Rear Admiral.
*  That's not what I expected his dad to look like.
*  So he's not a general.
*  That's always, heavy duty military man.
*  And then his son goes on and becomes one of the biggest
*  rock and roll stars of all time.
*  And like a complete counterculture figure,
*  drugs and chaos and pulling his dick out in front of people.
*  Madness.
*  Set and shoot on fire.
*  Driving a 67 GT 500 Mustang in the desert
*  and fucking hair and sunglasses.
*  And there's people that think that that sort of image,
*  this rock and roll star,
*  the decadent depraved rock and roll star image
*  was calculated by the CIA.
*  And that this was all part of the same anti-war movement.
*  What they were trying to do is stop the anti-war movement.
*  They were trying to stop the hippie movement.
*  And they think that what they did was encourage a chaos
*  that came out of worshiping these degenerate rock
*  and roll stars, they're all drug addicts
*  and saying crazy shit.
*  Right.
*  But as it like you're taking away his talent.
*  No, but you're not though, you're not.
*  They're saying they-
*  You're essentially saying that they promoted that.
*  Like the talent already existed.
*  But they realized if you can get this crazy chaotic guy,
*  sign him to a major record label
*  and then push him everywhere
*  and have these young kids see this guy.
*  Worship this guy with these sayings.
*  Worship this weird, the lizard king.
*  Right.
*  This fucking wild dude that Val Kilmer played in that movie.
*  Excellent.
*  Yeah, Val Kilmer like thought he was Jim Morrison.
*  He lost his fucking marbles.
*  I believe that. It's a great movie.
*  He seemed like Jim Morrison in that movie.
*  But that like, this documentary, this book is all about
*  that the CIA had a hand in this.
*  This is a different, I think a different,
*  I don't know exactly what they said he did in it,
*  but this is an explanation of what happened.
*  The details of the incident were distorted
*  perhaps intentionally between Morrison
*  and the other commanders on the scene,
*  the Pentagon and the White House.
*  That night, President Johnson interrupted prime time TV,
*  a very big deal in those days,
*  and told the American public that two US Navy warships
*  had been attacked on the high seas.
*  And he was asking Congress for support
*  to counter the North Vietnamese aggression.
*  At the same time, Morrison and his staff
*  told Navy headquarters in Hawaii
*  that the radar returns that the destroyers had targeted
*  were probably false returns generated by the rough seas.
*  Headquarters relayed the information
*  to the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara,
*  but he failed to give those details to President Johnson.
*  So he held the details back.
*  Wow.
*  So based on Johnson's testimony
*  that the destroyers had suffered an unprovoked attack
*  in international waters,
*  Congress approved of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution,
*  giving the president the authority
*  to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia
*  without a declaration of war.
*  So that was Morrison's dad was a part of that.
*  Wow.
*  So the thing is, it sounds super far-fetched,
*  but when you look at what they definitely did
*  with the Manson family,
*  what they definitely did with Operation MK Ultra
*  and Operation Midnight Climax
*  and all these different crazy mind control experiments
*  and what they did with the Harvard LSD studies
*  and what they did with the,
*  they were dosing people with acid
*  and trying to make them do things
*  and trying to turn them into psychopaths.
*  And they did it with the Manson family.
*  They got Manson when he was in prison
*  and dosed him up with acid allegedly,
*  taught him how to be a cult leader allegedly,
*  and then provided him with acid
*  and then repeatedly let him out of jail
*  every time he got arrested for things.
*  Yeah, because he was arrested a lot.
*  Yeah, and someone would step in
*  and say, this is above your pay grade,
*  and he would be out.
*  Yeah, and they know that he worked with Jolly West,
*  who was the guy who was running MK Ultra for the CIA.
*  So if they were doing that,
*  you think they're gonna leave rock and roll alone?
*  Right, right, right.
*  No, they probably would do it.
*  And then there's also some people now that are saying
*  they were a part of funding the gangster rap movement
*  of the 80s and the 90s.
*  Yeah.
*  That was another way to sow discord in society.
*  And when society is unstable,
*  you can control people more.
*  Sure.
*  When society is stable, then they wanna go,
*  hey, let's fucking get rid of some of these bureaucrats
*  that are useless.
*  Let's fucking clean up the streets.
*  That's a stable society with a great economy.
*  No, you want things in chaos.
*  And so that's the way you stay in power
*  and stay in control.
*  Yeah, what was that?
*  It was a movie or something silly
*  where they would play in the, it was the music,
*  they were musicians, whatever, they had an album out.
*  And in the album, they were putting something
*  to like get people to buy certain things or do certain things.
*  Oh, subliminal messages.
*  Yeah, but I forget what it was.
*  I forget what it was, but it was.
*  They would show like one frame,
*  they said, hungry, eat popcorn.
*  Yeah, they would show like a photo.
*  Was it a silly Will Ferrell movie?
*  I can't, it's like drive me crazy, like Ben Stiller.
*  But it was getting people to do things.
*  It was crazy, and I was like, that probably fucking happens.
*  Like you just. It definitely happens.
*  Movies and commercials. Josie and the Pussycats.
*  I know it was something stupid.
*  Find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy
*  to deliver subliminal messages through the popular music.
*  It was so silly.
*  Find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy.
*  So that was the TV show?
*  Oh, no, this is later.
*  This is way later.
*  Yeah, Josie and the Pussycats was an actual animated show
*  that was on when I was a kid.
*  That's why I was thinking it was silly.
*  So that's the movie from 2001.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that Will Ferrell?
*  I don't know if he's in it.
*  I just remember it being quirky.
*  Oh, I never saw this.
*  She's my favorite.
*  Look, Eugene Levy.
*  I love that dude too. Excellent.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I watched it because Parker Posey was in it.
*  You remember Schitt's Creek?
*  Yeah.
*  Schitt's Creek is hilarious.
*  You ever watch that show?
*  My mom loved that.
*  Such a good show.
*  She's like, put that shit on again.
*  I'm like, it's Schitt's Creek, lady.
*  You know what's a good show that I used to shit on
*  for no reason at all?
*  Because I just never watched it.
*  The Big Bang Theory.
*  Oh.
*  Big Bang Theory is a fucking funny show.
*  It is funny.
*  It's a funny show.
*  It has, yeah.
*  People say it's canned laughter,
*  but I think they did do it in front of a studio audience.
*  They did.
*  Well, some of it is canned laughter,
*  but that's the case in every single sitcom.
*  So what happens is, in any single sitcom,
*  you'll have takes that someone flubs a line
*  or something fucks up and you have to redo it.
*  Sometimes you redo it without the audience.
*  So you have pickups.
*  So after the sitcom's filmed, the audience leaves
*  and they say, oh, Joe, you have two pickups.
*  Dave, you have two pickups.
*  And so you'll just wear whatever you wore in that scene
*  again and redo the scene.
*  So you'll do it with no audience.
*  Yeah, I didn't think of that.
*  I thought they redo it with the audience.
*  No, sometimes they do that too.
*  We did that too, but you don't want to beat the audience up.
*  Right.
*  Sometimes if it's just a real quick second take,
*  they'll do a second take.
*  We'll do it one more time, folks.
*  But if there's a real pickup
*  or maybe they need a writing fix,
*  maybe someone comes along.
*  Sometimes they'll be watching it live
*  and they'll go, we need a better line here.
*  And so, okay, let's get it in post.
*  So then they wait until after the show and then they do it.
*  So if you watch an episode of The Big Bang Theory
*  and no one's laughing,
*  and the reason why is because they probably filmed that
*  without an audience.
*  Sure.
*  It's part of the process of making sitcom.
*  Also.
*  But it's a funny fucking show.
*  It's funny, and what they're talking about is bizarro.
*  Like we call my nephew Brandon Sheldon
*  because he's like Sheldon.
*  You know, everything's a ritual.
*  Like you have to do it a certain way.
*  It's incredible character.
*  But the way he shits on people
*  and the way he does like saying things
*  and then like they'll have to remind him,
*  hey, that's sarcasm.
*  And he's like, oh, that, like you people.
*  Like you're so minimal.
*  Well, he's also not that competent.
*  Right.
*  So it's like he's-
*  But he's bizarrely smart.
*  Bizarrely overestimates his words.
*  Even amongst other physicists, he falls short.
*  It's a complicated character.
*  It's very funny.
*  I think it's great.
*  I think he did a great job with it too.
*  No, it's a great show, but I was watching the other day.
*  The reason why I found that show actually
*  is a show that I think is even better than that,
*  which is Young Sheldon,
*  which is a Netflix show, which is no audience.
*  I haven't seen that's new, right?
*  Yeah, and Young Sheldon is about him
*  when he was a little boy and it's hilarious.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  It's not new.
*  I think there's like several seasons.
*  I think there's maybe six. Oh, New-er.
*  Yeah, New-er, yeah.
*  But I think there's like six seasons.
*  I think they started making it
*  after Big Bang Theory was done.
*  So then they did Young Sheldon.
*  Right.
*  But it's a really funny show.
*  And I was like, god damn,
*  this is about the Big Bang Theory?
*  And then we started watching the Big Bang Theory.
*  And I'm like, it's a good sitcom.
*  And it made me think like,
*  man, other than Miss Pat,
*  Miss Pat, who has a regular sitcom,
*  she has an actual legit film in front of us.
*  And it's hilarious.
*  It's hilarious film,
*  but you have to have the BET app to get it.
*  Maybe it's on something else too now.
*  Right.
*  What else is Miss Pat's show?
*  I see it on BET.
*  So other than that, like,
*  dude, they don't exist anymore.
*  The audience sitcoms?
*  There used to be a hundred of them.
*  Not good ones.
*  They used to be on the WB, the UPN,
*  and the fucking ABC and NBC and CBS and Fox.
*  There was so many fucking sitcoms.
*  Yeah, I think now everything's about hospitals.
*  Okay, you can get it on everything now.
*  Oh yeah, okay.
*  So you can get it on Roku, Amazon Prime,
*  YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and BET+.
*  Well, Apple TV's real good about that.
*  Most shit you can get,
*  even stuff that's like,
*  I'm watching Shogun,
*  Shogun's on FX.
*  Somebody just told me about that.
*  I gotta get into it.
*  They said it's really good.
*  It's very good, but you can watch that on Apple.
*  Yeah.
*  You just get on Apple TV.
*  Apple TV's the shit.
*  I love Apple TV, I have that.
*  They just turn you into a fucking Apple robot.
*  You buy everything,
*  you get sucked into the ecosystem,
*  and they make it easy.
*  Like, you resist, but you're like,
*  why am I resisting?
*  It's so much better.
*  Like, my phone is a remote control.
*  You use your phone as a fucking remote,
*  and it's a better remote control
*  than the one that's on your-
*  Absolutely.
*  Stupid thing that the guy programmed.
*  Wait a minute, this could be a remote?
*  I'm kidding.
*  My knees taught me that.
*  Your phone is a remote for Apple TV.
*  It's incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the best.
*  The Apple TV, I mean, go back to the TikTok thing.
*  I would see a lot of clips from Miss Pat.
*  People love it.
*  It's a great show.
*  So it's great to see,
*  because then, this is another thing.
*  They'll play clips from TV shows.
*  So you're like, oh, what is that show?
*  And then you kind of get into that.
*  I never watched that whatever show was out
*  a long time ago.
*  And then I'm like, oh, I should check that out.
*  And you'll find it on the apps.
*  So now I'm like watching it.
*  TikTok is telling me what to do.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess.
*  They're definitely moving you in a direction.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's not bad.
*  But the thing is, the question is,
*  should we protect people from the kind of influence
*  that can scramble their brains?
*  Sure.
*  Because you can't, like remember when a few years,
*  not a few years, a few months back,
*  all the TikTokers had got ahold of,
*  what the fuck's his name?
*  Osama Bin Laden.
*  Osama Bin Laden's Letter to America.
*  And they were like, oh my God, Osama Bin Laden.
*  He was the good guy.
*  Like America's the bad guy.
*  And it was like, oh, he's fucking.
*  Fucking Cobra Kai.
*  What is this shit?
*  No, I'm telling you, it's his foreign influence.
*  I guarantee you, there's some of that
*  that's a part of the accentuating that.
*  And then there's also the radical left today
*  that wants to attack everything that's America
*  and thinks that American flags are racist.
*  People are out of their fucking minds.
*  Well, anybody that wears an American flag,
*  they're considered like this Trump or whatever.
*  It's hilarious.
*  It's the left, right?
*  Is it the left?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not good.
*  Look at that right there.
*  I don't know.
*  That's a guy named American flag right next to Missy Shore.
*  Fuck yeah, it is.
*  Oh, I was literally looking at myself like, hi.
*  And then I'm looking at Mitzi's nipples.
*  And yeah, that flag is gorgeous.
*  I grew up, my mom worked for the Philadelphia Navy shipyard.
*  So she had rules.
*  You weren't, I see people with flags, like bikinis.
*  We weren't allowed to wear that.
*  My mom was like, that's disgraceful.
*  That's not how you wear the flag.
*  I'm like, oh, okay.
*  You couldn't have shorts with it on.
*  You had to fold it a certain way.
*  We'd drive down the street and she'd see tethered flags
*  and she's, those people are un-American.
*  She had to fold it a certain way.
*  You had to take it in when there was a storm.
*  She is a little crazy about the flag.
*  So when I see it, I'm like, oh, like I stand up straight
*  because I'm going to get yelled at by my mom.
*  So I get nervous.
*  But yeah, I don't look at a flag and think, oh, that's,
*  have you watched Cobra Kai?
*  But it's bizarre to say, I watched it for a little while.
*  I gave it a run for a while.
*  Okay, but you see what I'm saying?
*  They made Johnny.
*  Yeah, he's the bad guy now.
*  No, but they made him like he was.
*  Yeah, no, he's the good guy
*  and Ralph Moncho is the bad guy.
*  Right. It was hilarious.
*  I was like, this is, and then I'm like,
*  is that really what happened?
*  Now I'm starting to think it.
*  So the Osama Bin Laden, people are probably like,
*  fuck, this we've all been lied to.
*  Because we do get lied to a lot.
*  So the second you see one thing,
*  you could be like, see, we're right.
*  Also Osama Bin Laden was a CIA asset.
*  Osama Bin Laden trained the Mujahideen
*  to fight the Soviets.
*  He was a part of that.
*  So when he turned on America,
*  it was not like we didn't do anything.
*  Again.
*  I was like a crazy girlfriend.
*  Like I didn't fucking do anything.
*  He just fucking lied.
*  I didn't do anything.
*  It's no big deal that I shot his window out.
*  Why'd you guys get kicked out?
*  We were just laughing.
*  We weren't doing anything.
*  We were just laughing and they kicked us out.
*  Like how many times I've heard that?
*  I was helping this show.
*  How many times have you heard that?
*  A billion.
*  I was so disappointed in Donnell yesterday.
*  Donnell was telling me he started his career as a heckler.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Donnell Rawlings started his career,
*  he's like, son, I was moving tickets as a heckler.
*  He was saying that people would come to see him heckle.
*  That he would heckle the comedians.
*  That's how he got it started.
*  I don't know how to feel about that.
*  That's how he got it started.
*  He got his career started as a heckler.
*  Our enemy?
*  Don't you feel bad about that now?
*  Do you feel terrible about that now?
*  I mean, that's awful.
*  So how would he move tickets?
*  Like he would go to shows
*  and like prove he was better than the comics.
*  It's Donnell.
*  It's all like,
*  gonzo journalism.
*  You're not sure what's real, what's not.
*  I do love him.
*  He's the best.
*  I love him too.
*  He was looking sharp yesterday.
*  He got a three piece.
*  He does dress so nice.
*  Sometimes he does.
*  He's like changed his look.
*  He had a three piece with a tie and a pocket square.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Netflix special and a pocket square?
*  My man.
*  Slim cut, he looked good.
*  He looked like he was in good shape.
*  Lost weight.
*  I like it.
*  My special's on YouTube, so I'm wearing a sweatshirt.
*  Yeah.
*  But specials on YouTube are great
*  because they're accessible to everybody.
*  No, I love it.
*  It's a good move.
*  I was a little bit like,
*  like, oh, I should try to shop it.
*  And I sent it to a few people,
*  did a little bit of the shopping,
*  but then I was like, no.
*  I think the YouTube's the better option.
*  It's a great way because you're gonna ensure
*  that people will find it easy
*  and be able to get ahold of it instantaneously.
*  Everybody has a YouTube account.
*  Or if you don't have a YouTube account,
*  you just use YouTube with no account.
*  Exactly.
*  YouTube is like the only thing
*  that'll let you watch stuff with no account.
*  Well, I knew that when I saw my brother,
*  Charlie, watching it.
*  I was like, wow.
*  Like, he can't work Netflix, but he's got YouTube?
*  This is amazing.
*  Things like Instagram or TikTok.
*  Like, people send me TikTok links all the time.
*  I don't have TikTok, so I'm not gonna click on it.
*  So then I would have to sign up
*  or I'd have to watch it on the website.
*  It's annoying.
*  I don't wanna do that.
*  And I don't wanna sign up for TikTok.
*  So I don't have it, and so I don't click those links.
*  But if someone sends you a YouTube link,
*  it just starts working instantly.
*  You don't have to have a YouTube app on your phone.
*  It just shows you the thing.
*  You can go to YouTube from other websites
*  and it'll be like an embedded link
*  and you can watch YouTube
*  without ever opening up a YouTube app.
*  I don't think I knew that about the TikTok thing
*  because I do send them to my brother, Jimmy, a lot
*  and he doesn't have TikTok, Facebook, nothing.
*  You can kind of watch them,
*  but you gotta go to the website
*  and ask you to download the app.
*  You're like, no, thanks, China.
*  Fuck off.
*  Yeah, my brother would be like, what?
*  China, I'm buying all the American propaganda.
*  I'm not going to your Chinese website
*  to watch an open letter to America from Osama bin Laden.
*  By the way, I'm gonna Google that later
*  and try to find it. Wanna hear it?
*  Wanna hear the open letter to America?
*  Because they translate it.
*  See, the thing is, through AI,
*  one of the really wild things about AI
*  is it can seamlessly translate your voice
*  and even your lip movements to other languages.
*  So they're gonna do that with this podcast
*  where they're gonna translate this podcast
*  to Spanish, German, and...
*  Hey, papi.
*  What was the other one, Jamie?
*  Was it India? Was it Hindu? No.
*  That's great. French.
*  I think it's Spanish, German, and French.
*  I think that's it. Is that right?
*  I think those are the three at first.
*  That's awesome.
*  Right, so what they can do now though
*  is they can translate like Hitler's speech.
*  So they've got Hitler's speeches
*  that Hitler gave in German.
*  You put that, what I thought not that.
*  And you get to see it in English.
*  You're like, oh.
*  He sounds like Trump.
*  Right, right.
*  He doesn't sound nearly as radical as you thought he did.
*  And I'm just kidding, he doesn't sound like Trump.
*  But he doesn't brag about himself.
*  Right. He doesn't?
*  No, he's not funny. I thought he did.
*  Trump is funny. Trump is definitely funny.
*  He says funny things.
*  No one's like him.
*  But what he's doing is not like,
*  we gotta kill the Jews.
*  That's what I thought it was all.
*  I thought it was all like,
*  we gotta exterminate the Jews and kill.
*  When you see those things, those speeches,
*  that's not what he's saying.
*  You can't convince somebody just to say it outright.
*  You have to manipulate them first.
*  So he brought them in, he really brainwashed them.
*  For sure, and also he's methed out of his mind.
*  Oh really?
*  Oh yeah, Hitler was on all kinds of amphetamines.
*  Literally the only. You didn't know that?
*  I heard it, but I didn't believe.
*  You can see proof of it.
*  Okay. There's a video of him in the,
*  I think it was the 1936 Olympic games.
*  And he's in Moscow and he's just rocking.
*  Just sitting there rocking.
*  Look at this, look at him.
*  Oh yeah.
*  But I see, I'll look at that
*  and I'll think it's the film from back then.
*  Footage made off Hitler, 1936 Olympics.
*  Some people did say this is sped up a bit,
*  but he still is.
*  Yeah, whatever dude, whatever.
*  Dude, I'm doing that now and I'm not on meth.
*  Just look at all the other people in the audience.
*  They're not moving like that.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  That guy's methed out.
*  Even if it's sped up, but it doesn't look sped up.
*  The guy next to him does not look like
*  he's moving faster than normal at all.
*  Well maybe he does.
*  That's what it is.
*  Maybe he does.
*  That's creepy.
*  Look at the way that guy lifted up his binoculars.
*  It looks a little bit sped up.
*  Maybe one and a half speed.
*  Something's off.
*  You know sometimes people watch podcasts
*  at one and a half speed.
*  Yeah, I've seen that.
*  I was watching this YouTube video
*  where these guys were watching another YouTube video,
*  but they were watching it in one and a half speed.
*  And I was like, wow, that sounds weird.
*  And then I realized what they were doing.
*  I'm like, oh, they just speeded up
*  to get to the point quicker.
*  Yeah, when I was in high school,
*  I got a little bit obsessed with Hitler.
*  It was literally, I was a bad student, terrible student.
*  The only thing that piqued my interest
*  is this creepy guy was able to run five countries,
*  get five countries to believe what he was saying
*  and do what he was saying.
*  He was conquering these people.
*  And I'm like, this is a real person.
*  I was oblivious to everything.
*  So I started getting good grades
*  because I was paying attention.
*  And my mom was like, just during the pandemic,
*  she's like, remember when you loved Hitler?
*  No, no one loved Hitler.
*  I was just.
*  Well, listen, also back then when you were a kid,
*  that was 50 years after the war,
*  which is like, it just happened.
*  Yeah, so it was fucking serious?
*  So you're looking at your grandpa's age.
*  Your grandpa was alive when this happened.
*  Yeah, he was in the war.
*  So it's like, wait, what?
*  This is a real person?
*  I just didn't, because it would seem so far away
*  and then you're like, this just happened.
*  Yeah, it seems completely insane.
*  It seems completely insane that that just happened.
*  So the point is, so now they can take
*  those Osama bin Laden speeches
*  and they can translate that into English.
*  Do you use AI for anything else?
*  I don't use it.
*  My friend is trying to get me to download this app.
*  ChatGPT?
*  Yes.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yes, she says it every day.
*  I know a lot of, Duncan uses it constantly.
*  She says it fixes her letters.
*  If you hate someone, say if you hate someone,
*  Duncan will make an audio recording
*  of you praising that person
*  and talking about how you wanna go down on her
*  and I'm not even gay,
*  but there's something about the sweet smell
*  of her pheromones that excites me on a cellular level.
*  Like, anytime anybody is mad at somebody,
*  he will make some ridiculous audio recording,
*  some satirical audio recording of Duncanisms.
*  Cause it's almost as smart as Duncan.
*  Almost.
*  To me, I just put him on a pedestal.
*  I just, even like, he would torture me
*  when we were working together
*  cause he's the talent coordinator.
*  We called him the Sheik
*  because he came in after Princess Cory.
*  He hated the nickname, he hated the whole job, everything.
*  Well, he's just a comic that wanted a job.
*  Exactly.
*  And he says that, you know,
*  when I was waiting tables at the store,
*  I would be very harsh to comics, right?
*  And especially if I liked them,
*  I would fuck with them a lot.
*  And he said that he got off stage
*  and I said to him, I don't know what that was,
*  but it wasn't comedy.
*  I'm like, I did not.
*  Duncan's one of my favorites, but I probably did.
*  For fun.
*  For fun.
*  We all did that to each other.
*  It was a good time.
*  It was part of the fun of performing together.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but it's like what Duncan was,
*  was like this like, just a complete unique person.
*  Like, what are you doing here?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you should be in an ashram somewhere.
*  What's in the box?
*  Lil' Hobo.
*  Oh, okay.
*  He's bringing his fucking doll everywhere.
*  Someone stole Lil' Hobo
*  and he replaced it with a better Lil' Hobo.
*  I know.
*  I was very upset when I heard Lil' Hobo was stolen
*  because that was like one of my favorite things
*  to watch in the original room
*  because it would do the music, you know,
*  the whole thing was so good.
*  And then Dice would sit in the back and just be,
*  it's his favorite thing ever.
*  Cause I was like, you have to see this.
*  And then he came in to see it and he's like,
*  like this to Duncan, worships him.
*  No, it's incredible.
*  But Duncan is just a unique guy.
*  There's no other Duncan's.
*  I don't know anybody like him.
*  I know people that like try to pretend that they're that guy,
*  but that's really him.
*  He did call me an old mayor for a while.
*  So.
*  Mayor.
*  Motherfucker.
*  Fucking kill you, Duncan.
*  But you were always really good to go to,
*  like if I could always ask you
*  if someone was coming in from out of town,
*  if there were any good.
*  You were the one who would give,
*  cause a lot of people would bullshit.
*  Cause they were thinking,
*  maybe this guy's going to get a sitcom
*  and maybe I'll be on a sitcom.
*  I'll probably say, oh, he was great.
*  It's good set.
*  Solid material.
*  And I go to you, you're like, fucking hack.
*  He's a hack.
*  I go, really?
*  Yeah, he sucks.
*  I'm like, wow, really?
*  You're like, yeah, terrible.
*  As a comic, I feel like when people ask me like,
*  hey, so and so is coming in from New York.
*  And I'm like, oh wow.
*  Cause I don't want to.
*  Lie.
*  Right.
*  But I'm also, when I was waiting tables, I had no steak.
*  Like I wasn't a comic.
*  Exactly.
*  So it's like, okay, I could say whatever I want.
*  Cause I'm in a different field that, you know,
*  but now I'm in the same field.
*  So what if I'm coming to New York?
*  Somebody's like, she kind of sucks.
*  You know, whatever.
*  But then be undeniable.
*  So I get nervous that it's going to backfire.
*  It will.
*  But so.
*  It will.
*  That's how it works.
*  It will.
*  If you talk shit, people will look at you.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  If you watch groups of people that have developed
*  like a hater community,
*  that hater community will always target them.
*  They'll eventually turn on them.
*  Cause you've developed a bunch of attack dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  But now people like in a text thread,
*  they'll ask about people and you know,
*  we always fuck with each other in the text threads
*  and we can be very vicious and you know,
*  send horrible shit to each other.
*  And so, you know, somebody brought up some comic
*  from New York and I go, oh, they're really good.
*  Oh, that's the new Eleanor.
*  Oh, they're really good.
*  And I'm like, you go fuck yourself.
*  Cause now I'm watching people in a different light.
*  Yeah, you're being a little one-linier.
*  Yeah, but there are people that are objectively hacks.
*  Like you see them.
*  And you still see them clear as a fucking,
*  I mean anything.
*  They're just like plug and play.
*  Yeah.
*  They'll like find a topic that everyone's talking about
*  and talk about that topic.
*  That topic.
*  No unique take.
*  Zero unique take, but also like sometimes
*  it's internet jokes.
*  And I'm like, dude, you're getting away with this.
*  Like Rick Ingram said something about a comic
*  that getting a lot of press right now,
*  whatever you want to say for their special.
*  And he was like, this is vaudevillian.
*  Oh my God, it does go that far back.
*  Cause I'm like, yes, that is accurate.
*  But I don't try to shit on as many people,
*  but I do see it still.
*  Yeah, just it's sometimes better to keep moving.
*  But sometimes you have to be honest.
*  Like there's a problem when you're running a club,
*  you know, my situation, thank God I have that.
*  That club is so fucking amazing.
*  It's pretty fun.
*  Last week, I mean, two weeks, whenever I was here,
*  I'm still not off that high.
*  Still not off that high.
*  And getting to do it at Dom I Rara, even fucking better.
*  Yeah, it's a fun place.
*  So I give up all the power to Adam.
*  I basically say, look, you know what you're doing.
*  You're really good at it.
*  You decide who's booked here or not.
*  And we talk about it.
*  We talk about certain things,
*  but when someone hits me up and they know,
*  this is not the level that we're looking for.
*  It's hard to say.
*  Like what do you say to that person?
*  Like you've lost the way.
*  Like I don't know what you got, but it's not good.
*  Whatever you just did, it wasn't comedy.
*  I don't know what that was.
*  But the thing is, it's like,
*  especially if you're in a scene that sucks,
*  like if you're out there,
*  that's one of the things that's the most beneficial thing
*  about the club is that you're involved
*  with a bunch of other comics now.
*  Sure.
*  You know, it's a scene of like-minded people
*  and everyone's kind of doing the same kind of thing,
*  you know, and you get to like,
*  you get to feed off of each other's success and energy.
*  And there's a lot of comics out there
*  that do not have access to that.
*  And they get stagnant.
*  Get stuck in this little,
*  like I thought about this job I didn't get a long time ago.
*  And then I saw a person who got the job and I was like,
*  oh, I'm glad I didn't get that job.
*  It was a writing thing,
*  but now they're stuck in that little-
*  That's the velvet prison.
*  Right.
*  And they can't get out.
*  That's the velvet prison.
*  It's a bad prison to get in because you get a good living.
*  And then all of a sudden during the pandemic,
*  all that shit got shut down and all those guys were like,
*  oh no.
*  Yeah.
*  And I can't go on the road anymore
*  because nobody knows who I am.
*  Cause I've been working in a writer's room for 20 years.
*  And now watching that person like try to
*  bring themselves back and you're like,
*  the paddles aren't work.
*  And you also have a family now and you have a mortgage.
*  You can't be on the-
*  You're not a 21 year old guy on the road
*  where you can just kind of like sleep
*  with two other dudes in a hotel room and crash on the floor.
*  By the way, I can do that.
*  I'm gonna sleep in the tub cause everybody snores.
*  Right, right.
*  It's like we did wild things back then.
*  I slept in a storage room once.
*  I did a gig on an island and they had cots in a storage room.
*  This was like canned tomatoes and shit
*  where we had a bathroom that we could shit in.
*  And then there was like, there was nothing there.
*  Yeah.
*  There was no hotel.
*  It didn't exist.
*  Yeah.
*  Just so many gigs like that, but those,
*  they build character.
*  Those are important.
*  You can't do those when you're 50.
*  Certainly build character.
*  No, but I will say this.
*  I do kick myself in the ass a lot
*  cause I didn't start when I first moved to LA.
*  You know, I waited tables 12 years, then left,
*  came back a year and a half later as a comic.
*  That's mental illness.
*  I know, I get it.
*  But it's not, you just didn't jump.
*  But that's weird.
*  Like all those years, no interest in it, no nothing.
*  That's the weird part cause you didn't have an interest.
*  Well, no, and I think it was Freddie,
*  when Freddie Soto passed, that was the jarring moment
*  that was like, what are you doing?
*  And he would say it constantly.
*  You should be doing standup, come on the road,
*  that kind of shit.
*  And so, and a lot of comics said it,
*  but it was, cause we would fuck around in the kitchen.
*  I mean, I'm doing bits in the kitchen with you
*  with the, looking for a stamp.
*  I know you still do this thing where I would say,
*  hey, I gotta send a letter.
*  Do you have a stamp?
*  And she had an apron.
*  She would put her hand in her apron
*  and just start fingering herself.
*  And I'm like, are you finding a stamp?
*  And she would just go.
*  What, childish?
*  People around us would be like,
*  what the fuck are you guys doing?
*  I'm like, are you okay?
*  Yeah, and I just get real hard in there.
*  This running gag that we did for like five years.
*  So stupid.
*  So stupid.
*  But like, you're doing comedy in the kitchen,
*  but we're just fucking around.
*  Well, we were trying to find things
*  that would entertain our brains.
*  Right, right.
*  But you were always doing it with us.
*  So like, then you did the pro wrestling
*  and then you just stand up after the pro wrestling.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is like, oh, okay.
*  A bizarro.
*  But it worked.
*  Now you're a headliner.
*  It worked.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I'm loving it.
*  I mean, probably the, I got lucky with going on the road
*  with Dice.
*  We only had a few uncomfortable encounters
*  where I had to share a room with him and his ex-wife.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I'd be on the couch.
*  I'm not listening.
*  I swear.
*  La la la la la la la la la.
*  I've never heard any of this before.
*  La la la la la la.
*  That's crazy.
*  Dice made you share a room with him.
*  Well, just, I'll tell you what happened.
*  He was already Dice.
*  He already sold out Mass at Square Garden.
*  He was doing great.
*  It was my fault.
*  It was, I was supposed to leave at a certain time
*  and the plane got delayed.
*  Not my fault, but whatever.
*  So it was like, oh shit, or immediate, like,
*  that was the only uncomfortable.
*  Other than that, we're in five star hotels,
*  so I'm spoiled.
*  Right.
*  You know, I get that little one thing
*  and it was, you know, oh God, what is this?
*  Then I go on the road as a headliner by myself
*  and I'm like, oh, this is different.
*  You know, not as bougie,
*  but we're getting there.
*  Are you bringing people with you?
*  Not yet.
*  That's why I want to make this like my special.
*  I needed to go up because I think that's a great asset
*  to be, like, me and Andrew have so much fun on the road
*  because we're such good friends
*  and we fuck around through those videos all day.
*  And so we make the most of it.
*  But when you are on the road
*  and you have to use people you don't know,
*  and they're fine, but having your friends
*  is really, it's a great way to travel.
*  It's the only way.
*  It really is.
*  But you gotta get to a certain level
*  and you gotta be able to pay them to do that.
*  Yeah, I started doing it before I really could afford it
*  because I realized at a certain point in time,
*  it's better to have people on the road with you
*  than to make, well, I could afford it.
*  I should correct myself.
*  I could afford it, but it was, it cost me money.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  You're losing money on your gig.
*  Yeah, because it wasn't,
*  I wasn't getting a lot of money back then either.
*  So it's like, if I knew that the club wasn't willing
*  to pay airfare and hotel and pay an opening act,
*  like a good amount of money,
*  more than they're getting normally
*  when they would be working at their club.
*  So then I started bringing guys on the road with me
*  and I was like, oh, this is so much better
*  because then we're going out to dinner together,
*  we're laughing, we're in the green room together,
*  we're laughing, we do shows, we're laughing,
*  we go to the airport, we're laughing.
*  It's a lot less lonely.
*  It's fun.
*  It changes the entire gig and it makes the gig a great time.
*  And you know, I'm out there with Duncan and Joey and Ari
*  and so their family.
*  Yeah.
*  So we were having a great time.
*  It was a great time.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just fun.
*  It was just fun.
*  And it just makes the whole thing more of an experience
*  and then you're getting to watch them grow as well.
*  And now they're headlining, they're doing it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like everybody is moving up and that's a positive.
*  Exactly.
*  Everybody's learning from the road
*  and it's also, it's like just the experience of the job is,
*  we're all like, oh, we're so lucky we get to do this.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We do that all the time at the club here.
*  It's like, well, God, we're so lucky.
*  Last night, me and Steve Small were like,
*  we're so lucky to be here.
*  We're just in the green room loving it
*  because it's just so great to see.
*  It's family.
*  It is.
*  And when you meet somebody on the road,
*  like you go to another city and you see somebody
*  that you kind of came up with or whatever,
*  you're like, hey, you're like a doll.
*  I'm like, let me hang out.
*  Let's go hang out.
*  No, there's something extra special
*  about being on the road with some friends
*  from a different city.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And like one guy's working at a local club.
*  Yeah.
*  When's your show over?
*  10 o'clock.
*  All right, let's meet up.
*  Oh, you have two shows?
*  What a pussy.
*  You know, I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm still.
*  Yeah.
*  But those days are, you know,
*  like it's hard to appreciate it while it's happening,
*  but that's the rarest of rare in the world of occupations
*  because you do a thing that is really fun to do.
*  You love doing it.
*  And other people get a great joy out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then people go and they feel better.
*  And you're doing it with other friends
*  who are also doing it and also enjoying it.
*  And everybody's just having a party.
*  And you're just making the whole journey just more fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a better experience.
*  Like it just, what I'm lucky,
*  another fortunate thing is Dice loves doing clubs, right?
*  And I mean, he could do theaters, whatever,
*  but he loves doing these little clubs.
*  So what he'll do is he does the early shows.
*  He doesn't like to do two shows.
*  So I headline the late shows.
*  Nice.
*  We're still getting to hang out.
*  And then I'm meeting a lot of cool locals
*  from different areas.
*  So that's a little easier in that
*  I'm still hanging out with my buddy
*  and then I'm meeting new people.
*  That is nice.
*  Yeah.
*  So I am very, very fortunate, not good,
*  to work with him and get that kind of-
*  Where do you go up in LA nowadays?
*  I'm always at the store, of course,
*  but I do the lab factory, the improv.
*  And sometimes I'll even go do the ha ha.
*  I haven't done it in a while.
*  The ha ha is a good break.
*  But I love the ha ha too.
*  It's good.
*  I never fucked with Flappers.
*  I think I only went up on Flappers once.
*  No, I haven't.
*  I went up once there, I think.
*  The Ice House, they say, is like all revamped.
*  I haven't done it, to be honest, since you were there.
*  Yeah, that was a great spot.
*  Well, that's where I used to go
*  when I got kicked out of the store.
*  I spent a lot of my time at the Ice House.
*  I fucking nerves with that story.
*  Yeah, it was a fun time.
*  It's a fun piece of history.
*  It was fun.
*  It was interesting.
*  No, but yeah, we were doing the,
*  what was it?
*  The Friday Night Chronicles or the?
*  Ice House Chronicles.
*  Ice House Chronicles, I'm sorry.
*  Yeah, we did the Ice House
*  and I did the improv quite a bit too.
*  Improv in town.
*  But I always missed the hang of the store.
*  The hang of the store was always the different thing.
*  We had that quite a bit at the Ice House.
*  We had a good hang at the Ice House.
*  Well, say you built that with your club for sure.
*  The hang is phenomenal.
*  Well, the shows itself, great as well,
*  but it's like that hang is so cool too.
*  It's important.
*  But you brought that important
*  because I do feel like,
*  even if I work the other clubs,
*  I do wind up back at the store
*  because they have more of the space to hang.
*  But some nights you go and you go,
*  oh, it's not tonight.
*  And then some nights you're like,
*  oh, okay, this is like an old.
*  Well, that was always how it was even back in the day.
*  You'd go down there and no one would be there.
*  Sure.
*  And be like, ew, there were a few haters.
*  Waiting for, yeah.
*  And as a waitress, I'd be waiting for eight people
*  so we could start the show.
*  So it was fucking rough times.
*  But those nights sometimes were like the best
*  because everybody would show up
*  and we'd just hang in the kitchen.
*  Well, that's where Holtzman developed.
*  Oh God, yeah.
*  Those crazy late night sets.
*  He's another one.
*  I remember him showcasing.
*  Oh, I did his show when I was here.
*  I came in a little bit early
*  and I did his show on a Thursday night
*  and the crowd was phenomenal.
*  They loved him.
*  And I realized I said something a little out of control
*  and then I got a big, I go, oh, this is a Holtzman show.
*  Okay, because for a second I was like,
*  yo, you're not opening for, chill out.
*  This isn't a crowd that expects.
*  And then I realized, oh, it's Holtzman.
*  And I remember him showcasing for Mitzi
*  and she was passing on him, not passing him, if you will.
*  And he'd come in the back and he'd crush, murder.
*  And he'd come right in her face and he'd be like,
*  was that good enough?
*  Was that good enough?
*  Ah!
*  I'm like, why are you yelling at Mitzi Shore?
*  And she passed him in the belly room.
*  That's where she passed him.
*  Cause she, it was like a whole thing she put him through.
*  She really put him through the wringer, but it was great.
*  And he just, it would come in and come in.
*  We had so much fun with him.
*  Remember after September 11th,
*  she wouldn't let him go out for two weeks?
*  Cause he would bring it up.
*  Bring it up?
*  He was gonna open with it.
*  Of course.
*  He did it with the Oklahoma City Bombers, bombing.
*  And he did it with-
*  The woman who drowned her kids, Susan Smith.
*  We talked about the night after
*  all the Harvey Weinstein shit came out.
*  I don't know if I should say what I should say.
*  Whatever's in the news.
*  I'm not gonna say what the bit is.
*  Don't say what he said.
*  But anything.
*  Me and Adam were in the back like,
*  they're gonna lock the doors, we're done.
*  I wasn't, I didn't see what he said about Israel
*  after October 7th.
*  I was not there, but I could only imagine.
*  He did not leave that alone.
*  No he didn't.
*  He's a wild fucker.
*  And he's putting these road gigs up.
*  He's going and doing road gigs.
*  And then puts videos of people leaving the show.
*  It's like people getting upset.
*  Oh it's hysterical.
*  It's my new favorite thing.
*  Because you know I had to deal with it.
*  And back in the day, they would walk out.
*  Can I see the manager?
*  Like it became a thing I used to fuck with Holtzman.
*  And he'd say, you'd see he's saying stuff
*  people aren't loving it.
*  And I'd be in the back of it like,
*  can I see a manager please?
*  And he, you shut up bitch!
*  And he'd go crazy.
*  But it was like a, I feel like Donnell,
*  I used to heckle Holtzman.
*  But it was a bit.
*  But it was a bit.
*  It was a running gag we did at the store a lot.
*  We used to do a running gag with Brian Oates.
*  Tell us about your gay son.
*  Of course, my favorite thing to say.
*  But people would say it too early.
*  Like, not yet.
*  You gotta wait on that one.
*  And he would go, I'm proud of my boy.
*  That's my boy.
*  He would just go into this bit.
*  And he's just like, what the fuck are you saying?
*  Sometimes he would add crazy shit to it.
*  We were at dinner.
*  We were at Mitzi Shaw's house.
*  Art Linkletter was there.
*  Who?
*  Eleanor Kerrigan.
*  Like he'd put random people in there
*  with bizarro historians.
*  And then I remember Mitzi used to fuck with him
*  and make him follow certain people.
*  So he would follow Tonya Lee Davis.
*  I don't know if you remember her.
*  Very funny.
*  I don't know.
*  Little person.
*  I don't remember the proper term.
*  And she'd crush, right?
*  And then she'd get off
*  and she had a chair on stage and everything.
*  And Mitzi would be sitting in the back,
*  Holtzman go up, throw the chair down.
*  What kind of shit is it?
*  What is this, a circus?
*  Who's up next?
*  The bearded woman?
*  Like he just didn't, he couldn't handle.
*  That like Tonya Lee was in front of him.
*  And Tonya knew he was doing it.
*  So she'd laugh too.
*  She didn't care.
*  But he'd throw the chair down
*  and just yell at Mitzi for booking little people.
*  And Mitzi loved it.
*  She thought it was the greatest thing ever.
*  And Tonya would laugh too.
*  So she didn't care.
*  She loved chaos.
*  She really did.
*  But it was fun to even make it more fun.
*  Like a drama.
*  Like Tonya's walking away like, what the fuck?
*  But she knew it was a gag.
*  So she didn't care.
*  And she's killing it.
*  She still tours.
*  But it's just so funny.
*  Like I would love to put them back together
*  just like a bunch of years later.
*  Cause it's gotta be like 20 some years.
*  I've been doing this 16 years.
*  That's crazy.
*  I know.
*  When you get over 10, it's like getting your PhD.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, 10 years is like you're a real comic.
*  I cannot.
*  It seems like it.
*  I mean, people have done it quicker.
*  But you gotta be really obsessed.
*  And maybe you have a special talent.
*  Pretty lucky too.
*  Could be lucky.
*  But it also could be you are used to talking
*  in front of people.
*  Like maybe you were in AA.
*  Like a lot of guys from AA became really good comics.
*  Especially in Boston.
*  Cause they'd go up in front of people
*  and tell stories about being hammered
*  and all the shit they did.
*  So now I gotta find my car.
*  And everybody's laughing.
*  And it's funny but it's sad.
*  But it's hilarious at the same time.
*  A lot of really good comics started out in AA.
*  And so that was like a thing.
*  And also they had a lot of experiences to draw from
*  cause they had this crazy life but now they're sober.
*  So they had sort of a theme when they would go on stage.
*  That was like a cheat code.
*  And I saw some guys get good really quick that way.
*  But it seems like 10 years is the number.
*  That's the spot.
*  That's the sweet spot.
*  And even then at 10 years you're still like,
*  but you're trying to sort it out.
*  You're trying to figure out what it is that you do exactly.
*  I feel like that at 16 years.
*  Yeah, it takes a while.
*  I still feel like that sometimes.
*  I still sometimes I just reevaluate my stuff.
*  I love to be inspired.
*  When I'm inspired the key is acting on that.
*  If I get inspired of someone really funny who's at the club
*  and I see him like, that was great.
*  And I wanna go right.
*  But you gotta really go act on that
*  right while the inspiration is still,
*  why do I got that ember?
*  Keep it lit and then go with it.
*  But it's like,
*  you always should be fucking with it.
*  You're always looking at it and tweaking it.
*  That's like me and Norman were talking about that
*  the other day.
*  He's like, does it ever get to Groundhog Day?
*  And I was like, not if you're writing new shit.
*  It doesn't.
*  He writes constantly.
*  So there's always some new thing you're fucking with.
*  We do a lot of shows in New York together.
*  And I see him at every show.
*  Like if I'm at New York Comedy Club,
*  if I'm at the cellar, wherever Mark's on the show.
*  I'm like, this is great.
*  No matter what, he's still out there.
*  I think the night before he did,
*  he just did a big one in New York,
*  not the Carnegie, that's where I did,
*  but I was with Tice.
*  He was doing a big one and he was like,
*  do I take the subway like a normal?
*  And I'm like, take the car, get a nice car or something
*  and take it there.
*  I forget what venue he was doing, but it was giant
*  and it was a big deal for him.
*  And he's still at the stand the night before,
*  like doing shows.
*  And he's like, well, I'll see you guys after the big show.
*  He's so down to earth, which I love,
*  because you're still out there grinding.
*  And I remember one night I was at the cellar
*  and I was mad at myself because I didn't do a newer bit.
*  And he goes, pussy.
*  Like he didn't even, like, hey.
*  I was like, you motherfucker.
*  But okay, but he's right.
*  Do the bit, take the chance.
*  He's just always on too.
*  When we do Protect Our Parks,
*  he's just like, he's like just a pun machine.
*  Half of them, you can't even address them
*  because it would just throw everything off.
*  You'd never get a sentence out.
*  Just like, he just, he thinks it is such a different way.
*  He really is silly.
*  His notes are a clear sign of mental illness too.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Those things are insane, right?
*  It's like that, the stat.
*  You can see in his back pocket,
*  I thought he had a booty from one side, namee.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  It's just all flat on the other side.
*  They're all curved and sweated on and shit.
*  He's been sitting on them for years.
*  I believe it.
*  Very strange guy.
*  We were going from the stand to the comedy cellar.
*  And so we all piled in our body,
*  this guy, Greg Stone, also hilarious comic.
*  And we jump in his car, he's got kids.
*  So me and Mark were like wedged in baby seats, kind of things.
*  Like we moved them, but we were like wedged.
*  And he's like, is this good for you?
*  Always on and we're just literally on each other's laps,
*  like squished in poor Greg Stone's car.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, and then we all did sets at the cellar after.
*  But I was like, I hope he doesn't watch
*  because I don't want him to judge.
*  He called me a pussy for not doing my new shit.
*  But I worry about, because I talk so much shit
*  about comics that.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, that's why you gotta really make sure
*  you dot your I's and cross your T's.
*  Yep, so you can watch my special
*  and you can see that I work really hard.
*  Where's the special? Tell people how to get it.
*  It's on YouTube.
*  What's it called?
*  It's called No Country for Old Women.
*  Yeah, that's a great name.
*  I know.
*  And it came out March 1st, so it was like Women's Month.
*  And I was like, if you don't watch it, you hate women.
*  No, I'm just kidding.
*  Is that March?
*  Women's Month is longer than Black History Month.
*  Well, we're women.
*  Oh, look how they spelled my name.
*  No Country for Old Women.
*  This middle letter's missing.
*  Do you fucking believe that?
*  That's how my name looks.
*  Was that on purpose or is it a joke?
*  No, they didn't know.
*  We had a windstorm the night before
*  and it blew those letters off.
*  Oh no.
*  How fucking crazy is that?
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, and I did it in the OR.
*  We kept the lights on.
*  We did good.
*  It looks beautiful.
*  The lights look incredible.
*  My friend Lexi Shoemaker was a director
*  and she really, see the light on the bottom of the stage?
*  It kind of brightens it up a little bit.
*  There she is popping the cooch, huh?
*  The nerve of her to do this.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's really good.
*  I'm very, very proud of it.
*  And I love the name, of course,
*  because I love being silly.
*  The name's awesome.
*  But you know what it is,
*  because we were talking about women,
*  people say, if you talk about sex,
*  if you talk about this, politics, whatever it is,
*  they do tend to, oh, she always talks about sex.
*  She always talks about this.
*  She always talks about that.
*  Fine, and they always say, you're old.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  And I'm fucking fine with it.
*  I'm happy to almost be dead.
*  I don't know what else you want me to do.
*  People are just always trying to find
*  some way to shit on you,
*  because you're the person on stage getting attention.
*  I'm old, in my title.
*  Deal with it, fucker.
*  Deal with it, fucker.
*  All right, Eleanor, am I gonna see you tonight?
*  Yes, I'm excited.
*  All right, thank you, my friend.
*  You got more things to tell people?
*  This is exciting, no.
*  Oh, the Comedy Store podcast still.
*  We're still doing that, Comedy Store podcast.
*  And hopefully What's Up Doc with Jeff Danish will be back,
*  where we watch documentaries and reveal them.
*  We have so much fun doing it.
*  Cool, all right.
*  Give everybody your Instagram.
*  Instagram, EJKarrigan,
*  and I think it's just EJKarrigan across the board.
*  Somebody else. Twitter.
*  TikTok.
*  TikTok, go ahead, China.
*  Get in there, China.
*  Get our information.
*  Okay, I love you.
*  Love you more.

*  Bye.
*  Bye.
