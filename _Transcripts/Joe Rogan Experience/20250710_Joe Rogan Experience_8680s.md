# Joe Rogan Experience #2348 - Lukas Nelson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up. Lucas, what's up? Good to talk to you, man. Thanks for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate you having me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=17.0s)]
*  I gotta tell you, you know, when I heard Willie Nelson's kid plays music, there's a thing that you always do, and I have to admit it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=19.0s)]
*  You do it like when the son of a great man, you always assume, well, he's probably mediocre. You know what I mean? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=28.0s)]
*  And then you performed at McConaughey's, that charity function thing, and you fucking killed it, man. You blew me away. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=36.0s)]
*  It was incredible. And I was like, wow. It was really cool to see, man. It was really exciting. It was really fun. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=46.0s)]
*  You were the highlight of the night, man. You really were. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=54.0s)]
*  It's moments like those where I started to gain confidence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=57.0s)]
*  You know, I'd have over the years, I'd go out and play and I'd play my songs that I've written. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=62.0s)]
*  And I'd get crowds that would do that, you know? And so that gave me the confidence to keep going. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=68.0s)]
*  And I first started playing music in order to get closer to my father. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=75.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=80.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? So he would be gone all the time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=81.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=84.0s)]
*  And I'd be missing him. And so in order to get close to him, I figured I need to speak the same musical language. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=85.0s)]
*  And so I learned Young, and I wrote a song, Young, that's on the new album actually I got. It's called You Were It. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=94.0s)]
*  It's the first song I ever wrote when I was 11. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=102.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=104.0s)]
*  And my dad loved it so much that he covered it at the time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=105.0s)]
*  And he put it out on his album back in 2004. Called It Always Will Be. The album was called It Always Will Be. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=109.0s)]
*  And that gave me the confidence at a young age. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=118.0s)]
*  Chris Christopherson came up to me and he's like, man, you don't have a choice but to be a songwriter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=121.0s)]
*  And so I had all this inspiration at a young age, kind of like an athlete at a certain point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=126.0s)]
*  At a certain point, you kind of have to look at like, oh, well, if I have a talent at this, I have connections in the industry. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=131.0s)]
*  I need to work like I was going to go to the Olympics on this because it's something that I can do that will make it so that I never have to rely on my family or my father for anything. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=140.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=151.0s)]
*  You know, my whole goal in life is to discover who I am as an individual. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=152.0s)]
*  Is that a part of the difficulty of growing up with an incredibly famous father? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=159.0s)]
*  I think the, you know, Victor Frankl has a book, a very famous book called Man's Search for Meaning. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=164.0s)]
*  And it's about Auschwitz. And he was an Auschwitz survivor. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=174.0s)]
*  And he wrote about what was the common denominator in terms of people who persevered and survived in these camps. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=178.0s)]
*  And dignity and meaning were the common denominators generally. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=187.0s)]
*  And so finding who you what you mean in this life to yourself, it doesn't have to mean anything to anyone else. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=193.0s)]
*  And I think that's where for me, I've lived my whole life trying to discover who I meant to myself so that at the moment of my death, I can look back and say. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=200.0s)]
*  I did something that I enjoyed that was meaningful that gave me a sense of purpose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=210.0s)]
*  There's both a blessing and a burden to being the child of someone who's incredibly famous at a thing that you're trying to do. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=216.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=229.0s)]
*  You know, like there's a lot of sons of athletes, for instance, that live in their father's shadow. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=230.0s)]
*  And very few of them ever rise to the level that their father was at. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=237.0s)]
*  Sure. I think for me, I was never trying to be as great as him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=242.0s)]
*  I was only trying to be close to him because more than anything, my father's a great human being. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=246.0s)]
*  He's a well-rounded, kind, empathetic human. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=252.0s)]
*  And I am I am truly grateful to be his and my mother's son. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=256.0s)]
*  You know, because I have a good family, I'm lucky. You know, I have also, you know, I have a good, good parents. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=264.0s)]
*  So what I was trying to do was just be closer to him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=269.0s)]
*  And, you know, as a little kid, you know, the best thing my mom ever did was when I was like earlier, I was probably five or six years old. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=272.0s)]
*  And my brother had just passed away not too long before this, actually. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=282.0s)]
*  And I would cry every time my dad would leave, you know. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=287.0s)]
*  And my mom sat me down one time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=291.0s)]
*  He said it tears him apart when you cry like this because he doesn't want to leave. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=294.0s)]
*  He's going out there. He's making people happy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=298.0s)]
*  He's giving people joy and he's doing what he came here on this earth to do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=300.0s)]
*  And he's supporting this family. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=304.0s)]
*  And so the support that my mother had for him at that moment, I never cried again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=306.0s)]
*  I was able to let go of that idea. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=312.0s)]
*  And then just from that point on, work towards creating what would make me happy in my life and give me the same joy and then be able to take care of my family. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=315.0s)]
*  Hopefully, you know, one of my greatest sources of pride is that I haven't had to ask my parents for anything. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=323.0s)]
*  I bought my own house. I bought my you know, I went and did Star is Born and I got you know, I mean, I've been able to make myself a living. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=330.0s)]
*  And I think that makes my parents proud. It makes my dad proud. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=340.0s)]
*  And that's what I've always wanted to do. That's been my whole my whole life is one to make them proud. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=343.0s)]
*  That's awesome. Well, it's a great motivation, you know, for sure. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=348.0s)]
*  When especially you have great parents that try to be lucky in that way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=352.0s)]
*  You know, I know a lot of people have broken homes and grew up and even I caught dad at a good time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=357.0s)]
*  I mean, my dad was 55 or so when he had me, you know, and so he had already been through a lot of his demons and gotten through them and faced them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=364.0s)]
*  Yeah, and was still going through them at the time that I was born. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=373.0s)]
*  But he had come out of, you know, a life of habit and sort of formed the ones that would take him at that point to where he is now at 92 years old. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=376.0s)]
*  And so I got a good version of dad, you know, who had grown since, you know, and so man, you know, I'm the luckiest guy in the world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=386.0s)]
*  I feel like I, you know, I was able to be exposed to a lot of great music, a lot of great mentors, you know, in my life. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=397.0s)]
*  And and I'm also lucky that I at a young age, I'm grateful to my younger child, to myself as a young child for having the wisdom to say, all right, work hard now. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=404.0s)]
*  Forget about parties. Forget about hanging out. Work hard. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=418.0s)]
*  Eight hours, 10 hours a day. Practice your guitar. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=421.0s)]
*  Write all the time. Sing all the time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=424.0s)]
*  So that when you get to a certain point in life, you'll have something to show for, you know, something you can leave behind. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=427.0s)]
*  Something you can leave behind that's yours. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's awesome, man. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=435.0s)]
*  That, you know, that's what most people in this life want. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=438.0s)]
*  They want a purpose. Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=441.0s)]
*  You know, they want something that means something both to them and other people. Exactly. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=443.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to find. It's hard to find a purpose. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=448.0s)]
*  You know, I that is something that I've always had growing up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=451.0s)]
*  And I think it's because I was, you know, again, I'm grateful to that younger kid. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=454.0s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like he's wiser than I am now. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=459.0s)]
*  You know, that younger self is like almost, you know, I know. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=462.0s)]
*  And now that I'm sober, I mean, I quit smoking weed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=468.0s)]
*  I quit drinking. And when did you do all that? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=471.0s)]
*  Really around the pandemic. Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=474.0s)]
*  But that's usually when a lot of people started. Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=476.0s)]
*  I went the opposite way. I started meditating twice a day. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=479.0s)]
*  You know, the only thing I'll do now is mushrooms every once in a while to check in with myself and, you know, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=483.0s)]
*  just kind of make sure that I'm, you know, I feel like mushrooms is like taking a nice good whole hose to your soul and just kind of like, you know. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=488.0s)]
*  Yeah. Clean out all the bullshit. Clean out all the bullshit. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah. I feel like, you know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=497.0s)]
*  They should be legal. Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=499.0s)]
*  Really? If I could talk Trump into one thing, that might be the one thing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=503.0s)]
*  I've, you know, I had this conversation with Paul Stamets the other day. I love Paul Stamets. He's amazing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=508.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. I just saw him at the Dead Show, the Sphere show. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=513.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=517.0s)]
*  Have you been to his place? He invited me to his place up there. It's supposed to be amazing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=520.0s)]
*  I was just reading an email from him today, inviting me to his place. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=524.0s)]
*  That's awesome. Yeah. He's a prepper. He's ready for the apocalypse. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that might be a good idea. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=532.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe. I don't know. I think we're going to be okay. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=536.0s)]
*  I do too. I do. I mean, I think the feeling that we might not be okay, though, is a great motivator. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=540.0s)]
*  We should always be checking in with ourselves and asking ourselves, are we going too far to certain extremes? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that was the part of the conversation that we had. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=552.0s)]
*  You know, we're like, is there a thing that could really help the world? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=555.0s)]
*  And it sounds so cliche and hippie and especially someone who's never done mushrooms. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=559.0s)]
*  But I think that might be the thing, you know, even if it's just like small doses, just a little something to alleviate anxiety, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=565.0s)]
*  bring people closer together, make them understand that there's more to life than conflict and bullshit. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=573.0s)]
*  And most of your conflict is bullshit. Most of it is nonsense. Most of it's unnecessary. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=579.0s)]
*  My dad always says 99 percent of the things you worry about never come true. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=584.0s)]
*  And it's just a matter of. Yeah, I mean, it is sort of a cliche. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=589.0s)]
*  I read The Power of Now, which is Eckhart Tolle, when I was like 13. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=594.0s)]
*  I went to school next to a Buddhist temple. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=601.0s)]
*  And so I grew up with my dad teaching me the Lord's Prayer, I'd say every night. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=604.0s)]
*  And then I'd go to this Buddhist temple and hang with these monks. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=608.0s)]
*  You know, really? Yeah. Yeah. Where is that? I grew up part time in Austin. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=611.0s)]
*  I was born in Austin. I was in Maui. And so I Buddhist temple. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=615.0s)]
*  There's a Buddhist temple right near where I was going to school at the time. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=619.0s)]
*  So after school every day, I'd sit with these monks. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=623.0s)]
*  Just the vibe of that is powerful. The chanting, the energy around that, you know, the presence, though, that they have. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=627.0s)]
*  They're just, you know, their whole goal, obviously, is to just, you know, be purely present. Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=634.0s)]
*  And so while that sounds like a cliche, I truly believe that that's an important thing, you know, to to let go of the battle of positive and negative, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=639.0s)]
*  that in the mental space, that's all that exists is duality, you know. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=652.0s)]
*  Well, to find a true path, you have to avoid being pushed and pulled in a bunch of directions that are totally unnecessary. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=657.0s)]
*  And sometimes you get sort of preoccupied or captivated by the push and the pull of bullshit. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=666.0s)]
*  Well, and we're we there is a manipulation that happens on purpose. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=674.0s)]
*  I have a song called Turn Off the News and Build a Garden. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=681.0s)]
*  Hmm. Do you ever hear that song? No, I haven't heard that one. You want me to play it for you? Yeah, play it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=684.0s)]
*  This is a song called Turn Off the News and Build a Garden. And I wrote it because because it's great advice. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=690.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I just I was just the news cycle. I mean, there's a difference between being informed and being constantly captured by the overwhelmed. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=697.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=707.0s)]
*  Got a tune for all your listeners. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=715.0s)]
*  I believe that every heart is kind. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=723.0s)]
*  Some are just a little underused. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=729.0s)]
*  Hatred is a symptom of the time. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=734.0s)]
*  Lost in these uneducated blues. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=740.0s)]
*  I just want to love you while I can. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=745.0s)]
*  All these other thoughts have me confused. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=751.0s)]
*  I don't need to try to understand. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=757.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll turn off the fucking news. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=764.0s)]
*  Turn off the news and build a garden. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=768.0s)]
*  Just my neighborhood and me. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=772.0s)]
*  We might feel a bit less hardened. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=775.0s)]
*  We might feel a bit more free. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=778.0s)]
*  Turn off the news and raise the kids. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=780.0s)]
*  Give them something to believe in. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=784.0s)]
*  Teach them how to be good people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=787.0s)]
*  Give them hope that they can see. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=790.0s)]
*  Hope that they can see. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=796.0s)]
*  Turn off the news and build a garden with me. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=802.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=808.0s)]
*  Yes. So I, you know, I've always felt that way. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=809.0s)]
*  And I think that there's action. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=811.0s)]
*  It's so important being a part of your community, being a part of decisions that are made. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=816.0s)]
*  I think that's huge. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=821.0s)]
*  I think local communities are really important. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=822.0s)]
*  I think local town meetings, understanding where you're going. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=828.0s)]
*  You know, and understanding where your neighborhood is going and getting to know your neighbors, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=829.0s)]
*  because it's really hard to. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=835.0s)]
*  It's hard to have any hatred when you understand and know your neighbor. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=838.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=843.0s)]
*  You know the people that are around you and know they, you know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=844.0s)]
*  And so I think that, yeah, that's kind of where I come from. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=847.0s)]
*  I just think like, you know, it's important to get out there. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=851.0s)]
*  And I put my, I usually try not to stand on soap boxes though. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=855.0s)]
*  You know, man, I put, if I have something to say, I'll put it in my music, you know, and I'll put it out there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=859.0s)]
*  Well, that's the best way to get it to people anyway. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=866.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at Bob Dylan, masters of war. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=869.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the military industrial complex right there. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=871.0s)]
*  That's an incredible song. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=874.0s)]
*  Only a pawn in their game is the history of racism and how that, you know, started. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=876.0s)]
*  It is pretty much a controlled political ploy to get the poor blacks and the poor whites to blame each other for everything happening. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=883.0s)]
*  You ever hear Bill Hicks bit about the news? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=892.0s)]
*  I was just listening to Bill Hicks. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=895.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=897.0s)]
*  He's got that great bit about the news like war, famine, disease, AIDS. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=899.0s)]
*  You go outside, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=903.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where the fuck is all this shit happening? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=905.0s)]
*  I think Ted Turner's making this shit up because his wife won't fuck him. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=907.0s)]
*  Well, you know, look, I think it's out there. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=912.0s)]
*  I think it's always been out there. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=915.0s)]
*  But I think the way to combat it is to build strong local community. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=917.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=926.0s)]
*  You know, and build, you know, that's why I think regenerative farming is really important and trying to, and then, you know, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=927.0s)]
*  voting for people that will support local agriculture and properly grown food and properly sourced food. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=937.0s)]
*  And these things are very important, you know. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=946.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly important for a community if you know exactly where your food's coming from. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=948.0s)]
*  We're just so, it's not, you know, in the Bill Hicks days, it was just the news. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=953.0s)]
*  But now I think the real problem that people have today is social media. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=958.0s)]
*  And, you know, I never, I very rarely, if I post things, I just post them and then get out of there. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=962.0s)]
*  I don't read anything. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=969.0s)]
*  And I very rarely read social media anymore. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=970.0s)]
*  And since making that decision to kind of stay away from it, I think occasionally I have to dip in just to see what's, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=973.0s)]
*  because I'm a comedian, it's part of the problem. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=980.0s)]
*  So you got to know. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=982.0s)]
*  I need to know what people are doing, why everyone's so mad, what's happening. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=983.0s)]
*  But there's too many people that are on it all day long. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=988.0s)]
*  And I think it's poison. I really do. I think it's bad for your mind. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=993.0s)]
*  I think it generally attracts negativity. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=997.0s)]
*  I think most of the stuff that people post is negative. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1001.0s)]
*  And they're complaining all the time. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1004.0s)]
*  And then that gets into your mind and that gets into your whatever, you know, your headset is, your headspace. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1006.0s)]
*  And then you start thinking the way these people are thinking. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1012.0s)]
*  I like to be informed on what I'm talking about. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1016.0s)]
*  You know, I really do. And that takes a lot of time. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1022.0s)]
*  It's not something that I can look at something online that comes up and just have an immediate opinion on. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1023.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1028.0s)]
*  And I think that really I'm just like I don't know where I stand on half the issues that are out there because I'm I, you know, I see a lot of I have to sift through most of the bullshit. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1029.0s)]
*  So really where it ends up happening is, is that by the time I get to the voting booth, I'm hoping that I'm properly informed. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1043.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to be properly informed because it's hard to know who's telling the truth. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1050.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1054.0s)]
*  I give you pay attention to this big, beautiful bill that just got passed. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1055.0s)]
*  I've been trying to sort out what's real and what's not, you know, and the real fear that people have is Medicaid. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1058.0s)]
*  Right. The real fear is that people are going to lose access to health care. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1064.0s)]
*  And it's so but then there was this just giant arrest where they found billions of dollars of fraud and hundreds of people were arrested. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1068.0s)]
*  Doctors, health care providers, you know about all that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1079.0s)]
*  Right, Jamie? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1082.0s)]
*  You saw that big arrest? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1083.0s)]
*  It's, you know, so I saw something, but, you know, I just I just don't know enough. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1086.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know enough either. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1091.0s)]
*  So they're trying to eliminate fraud as a part of this. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1092.0s)]
*  Right. But the consequences of that is like, well, OK, but is this going to affect poor people? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1095.0s)]
*  Is this going to affect legitimate poor people that just need help? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1100.0s)]
*  And that's to me, that's the most important thing. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1103.0s)]
*  National health care fraud takedown results in three hundred twenty four defendants charged in connection with over 14 billion, 14.6 billion in fraud. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1106.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1116.0s)]
*  Largest Justice Department health care fraud takedown in history, more than doubles prior record of six billion. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1117.0s)]
*  Wow. That's a government website. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1123.0s)]
*  Right. I don't know. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1126.0s)]
*  You know, I just write, you know, I just don't know. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1128.0s)]
*  And I don't know enough. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1130.0s)]
*  And I know that there's probably more to the story than we're seeing. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1132.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. Right. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1135.0s)]
*  And so, you know, that's kind of how like controlled opposition works to, you know, you just sort of, you know, says Medicare Medicaid services also announced successfully prevented over four billion from being paid in response to false and fraudulent claims and that it suspended or revoked the billing privilege of 205 providers the month leading up to the takedown civil charges against 20 defendants for 14.2 million in alleged fraud as well as civil settlements with over 160,000. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1136.0s)]
*  Totaling in thirty four point three million. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1164.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1167.0s)]
*  Well, I'll have to do some research or not. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1168.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1171.0s)]

*  But at the same time, what I what I do know is that there's a lot of marginalized communities, whether it's a class issue or it's a you know, it just I just see that there's a lot of people who don't have a lot of money or suffering. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1239.0s)]
*  And for sure, there's a lot of people getting caught in crossfire all over the world. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1256.0s)]
*  And it's a humanitarian issue. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1263.0s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1266.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, and so, you know, I as a musician, I have a responsibility to observe. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1267.0s)]
*  I think as an artist, I have a responsibility as a human, as a human. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1274.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we all have a responsibility to observe. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1278.0s)]
*  And I also don't like to keep my opinion resolute. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1280.0s)]
*  I don't like to identify with my opinion, meaning like I'm not joining any teams here. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1286.0s)]
*  You know, great. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1292.0s)]
*  I don't have any teams. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1293.0s)]
*  I want to know what what based on if I get conflicting information, I have to make a decision on which one's going to sway the decisions I make going forward. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1294.0s)]
*  You know, stuff that's not in this world is really not easy. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1307.0s)]
*  But back in the day, interestingly, I think they had more of an ability to manipulate us back in the day because we only had one or two sources of information. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1312.0s)]
*  Oh, no doubt. No doubt. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1323.0s)]
*  Well, listen, as confusing and as frustrating as social media is and as dangerous as it is for your psyche, it's better. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1324.0s)]
*  It's better to have it than to not have it because you don't have to listen to it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1333.0s)]
*  You don't have to go on it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1337.0s)]
*  And that's what I always tell people. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1338.0s)]
*  Stay off it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1339.0s)]
*  But it's there for you. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1340.0s)]
*  If you like when shit pops off in the world, it's the best source of information. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1341.0s)]
*  I Google things all the time and they're not there. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1347.0s)]
*  And then I'll go to X and they're there immediately. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1351.0s)]
*  When something happens in the world, it's on X before it's on anywhere else. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1353.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of platforms. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1357.0s)]
*  I'm sure that, yeah, that Google is. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1362.0s)]
*  But the thing is, X is immediate, right? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1363.0s)]
*  It's people that are on the ground and people that are experienced and independent journalists use it more often than anything else. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1366.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1373.0s)]
*  And sub stack. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1374.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that, you know, I think the only thing that I think I worry about with that is that the pendulum swings so far in either direction in response to certain things. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1375.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1387.0s)]
*  In response to perceived censorship in one way, then it becomes the instead of it being completely a platform of opinions, you know, then censorship happens on that side with dissenting opinions. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1388.0s)]
*  You know, and so I think that the censorship just continues to be like, OK, well, it just goes back and forth. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1403.0s)]
*  And so I have a hard time. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1409.0s)]
*  I have a hard time understanding, and that's why I don't really feel like I have an ability to form a proper opinion on a lot of this shit. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1411.0s)]
*  Well, that's an intelligent perspective, because the reality is so many people that have really strong opinions aren't informed. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1419.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1425.0s)]
*  And I see people that die on uncertain hills and then, you know, but with no ability to formulate. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1426.0s)]
*  Like, that's why I'm a musician. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1432.0s)]
*  You know, that's why I do what I do here, because I, you know, all I do is, you know, I err on the side of compassion. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1433.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, I'm compassionate for people who are suffering. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1442.0s)]
*  I have compassion for suffering. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1447.0s)]
*  I believe that I believe that empathy can be manipulated, but I don't believe that it's I think it's a necessary emotion. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1449.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1458.0s)]
*  For cooperation and human condition. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1459.0s)]
*  That's a great way to put it, you know, because empathy can be manipulated. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1461.0s)]
*  It can be manipulated through psychological warfare. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1465.0s)]
*  But I also believe that it's an it's never a good idea to then shut it off. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1467.0s)]
*  Shut it off. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1472.0s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1473.0s)]
*  Well said. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1475.0s)]
*  That's a really good. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1476.0s)]
*  And I also will say this. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1477.0s)]
*  Like, I think throughout history, there have been examples where people have put their faith in policy over character. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1490.0s)]
*  And I think that's a mistake. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1491.0s)]
*  I think the character of the person implementing the policy is just as important as the policy they represent. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1492.0s)]
*  Well, you know, and today nothing gets implemented. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1499.0s)]
*  There's no policy that gets drafted or implemented without a lot of weird influence. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1503.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1507.0s)]
*  Influence from money. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1508.0s)]
*  It's always money. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1509.0s)]
*  And I have no idea the depth of that. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1510.0s)]
*  So so where am I? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1512.0s)]
*  Where am I? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1514.0s)]
*  You know, where am I? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1515.0s)]
*  Where am I? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1516.0s)]
*  My truth lies in compassion. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1520.0s)]
*  And in trying to reach the hearts of people and through music. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1521.0s)]
*  Darryl Day. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1525.0s)]
*  Do you know Darryl Davis? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1526.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1527.0s)]
*  I've had him on a couple of times. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1528.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1529.0s)]
*  He's great. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1530.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1531.0s)]
*  He's a hero of mine. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1533.0s)]
*  He's an amazing person. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1534.0s)]
*  What a fearless person to be able to go and sit down with these people and change their hearts. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1538.0s)]
*  Hundreds of hundreds of them collecting one on one with what he does. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1539.0s)]
*  So Darryl is a musician and Darryl, through the course of his travels, met the it started. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1543.0s)]
*  He told me the whole story. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1549.0s)]
*  The first guy he met, he didn't really believe him that the guy was actually in the KKK. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1550.0s)]
*  Darryl is a black man. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1554.0s)]
*  And so this guy pulls out his KKK membership card or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1555.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1560.0s)]
*  And he couldn't believe it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1561.0s)]
*  And he's like, well, you're not like the other ones. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1562.0s)]
*  And he's like, well, what do you mean? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1564.0s)]
*  Do you know everyone that's black? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1565.0s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1567.0s)]
*  And so he becomes friends with this guy, has dinner at his house. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1568.0s)]
*  And then the guy gives him over the course of their friendship, gives him his robe. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1571.0s)]
*  He says, I quit, man. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1575.0s)]
*  Obviously, what I'm doing is wrong because you're my best friend. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1577.0s)]
*  You know, like I love you. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1581.0s)]
*  And so it can't be true that the black man is my enemy if you are such a cool person. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1583.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1589.0s)]
*  And humans must be allowed to grow. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1590.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1592.0s)]
*  We have to allow people who have made mistakes in their past to we have to suspend judgment enough to allow that person to grow. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1593.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1605.0s)]
*  Because you have to understand like what influences was this guy subject to that led him to join the KKK in the first place? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1606.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1614.0s)]
*  Like what was the community that he was in? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1615.0s)]
*  What had he been exposed to? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1617.0s)]
*  Obviously, he had never been exposed to anybody like Darryl before he met him. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1619.0s)]
*  So he meets Darryl and then changes his ways. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1622.0s)]
*  Well, who knows if that guy grew up with cool parents in a different community, he would have been a different person. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1625.0s)]
*  100 percent were products of how we are brought up. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1630.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1633.0s)]
*  For the most part. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1634.0s)]
*  Our life experiences and what we've learned and the paths we've taken. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1635.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1639.0s)]
*  And you know, and you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of that going on. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1640.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm from Texas and I've toured the South and I know how that is. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1644.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that grow up being indoctrinated. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1648.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1653.0s)]
*  And with really not not good ideas. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1654.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1657.0s)]
*  But they don't know until they're able to. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1658.0s)]
*  That's what I was saying earlier about, you know, that's what music does. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1661.0s)]
*  I love a great example of Paul Simon. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1666.0s)]
*  Played a show in South Africa just after apartheid. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1669.0s)]
*  He when he did the Graceland album, right, he went down there and he. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1675.0s)]
*  Worked with local African musicians and created, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums of all time. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1680.0s)]
*  I mean, with Ladysmith Black Mombazo doing the vocals on that and they're incredible. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1689.0s)]
*  And I think that's the most incredible musicians. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1694.0s)]
*  And at the time, that was a culturally powerful thing because there's a show online. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1698.0s)]
*  You can watch it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1705.0s)]
*  There's there's a you should probably pull it up. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1706.0s)]
*  There's it's amazing. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1708.0s)]
*  There's like Paul Simon playing for tens of thousands of black and white people in right after apartheid. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1709.0s)]
*  You may even be during apartheid and they're all dancing and bobbing up and down. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1718.0s)]
*  It's the most joyful thing ever. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1722.0s)]
*  Music is powerful. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1724.0s)]
*  They can bring people together. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1725.0s)]
*  But because what it does is it reaches everybody's heart and it cuts through all the bullshit, the mind stuff, you know, and everyone can relate to having their heart broken. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1727.0s)]
*  You know, maybe it happened for some at a young age. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1737.0s)]
*  Maybe it happened. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1740.0s)]
*  Maybe maybe some people had their heart broken at age four to the point where they closed their hearts off nearly completely. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1741.0s)]
*  But even Darth Vader had a little bit. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1748.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1750.0s)]
*  Darth Vader and everyone forgets that Darth Vader at the end of Star Wars redeemed himself. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1752.0s)]
*  It's the Carl Jung, the archetype, right? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1760.0s)]
*  The Dark Knight of the soul and being able to come through that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1763.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1766.0s)]
*  And like and really like. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1767.0s)]
*  You know, and you can judge. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1770.0s)]
*  You can not want to be around like I think Carl Jung actually talks about like there are certain people and things that you can't allow to exist because they're dangers to everyone else. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1773.0s)]
*  But at the same time, you don't have to judge their humanity. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1783.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1786.0s)]
*  You just like it's like a wasp. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1787.0s)]
*  You have to swat the wasp because it's going to sting you. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1789.0s)]
*  But you know, or or, you know, however you feel about that, you can put it outside. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1791.0s)]
*  But you get it away. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1796.0s)]
*  You know, but you don't you don't call the wasp evil. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1797.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1800.0s)]
*  There are people that have just been corrupted for whatever reasons to the point where you just need to remove them from the situation. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1801.0s)]
*  But I don't I try not to have hatred towards that. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1808.0s)]
*  I just I just sort of understand that they are where they are in their lives and they got there for some reason. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1811.0s)]
*  It's a cautionary tale for everyone. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1820.0s)]
*  That's the thing about today's access to information is you could see so many different cautionary tales. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1821.0s)]
*  You can see so many different people that went down the absolute wrong road. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1827.0s)]
*  And you get to see them and you get to shine a light on them in this very strange time. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1832.0s)]
*  You get to see like this. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1839.0s)]
*  This is you could have been that person. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1841.0s)]
*  Anybody could have been that person. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1843.0s)]
*  We're all easily worse. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1844.0s)]
*  We have so many similarities. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1846.0s)]
*  And that's what we all of us do. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1849.0s)]
*  And we have to recognize that your unique situation in life, your unique community, family, life experiences, all the things you've gone through that made you who you are today didn't have to be that way. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1850.0s)]
*  You could have been in the worst circumstances. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1865.0s)]
*  And there's people that are in the worst circumstances. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1868.0s)]
*  And they're a product of that. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1870.0s)]
*  And that's the weirdness of life. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1873.0s)]
*  There's not necessarily good and evil. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1875.0s)]
*  And evil results. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1878.0s)]
*  But humans inherently. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1880.0s)]
*  We have both inside. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1883.0s)]
*  We have both inside. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1884.0s)]
*  We're the yin and the yang. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1885.0s)]
*  I think you need that, unfortunately, too. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1887.0s)]
*  We need to know that that exists in order to grow. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1889.0s)]
*  When people ask, you know, and I'm a very lucky human. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1894.0s)]
*  So like I say all these things with hopefully the right perspective that I am as far as I'm in like the top one percent of the luckiest people or probably even the higher than that, you know, with access to clean water. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1899.0s)]
*  I don't have to worry about when I'm pulled over being shot. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1918.0s)]
*  I don't you know, there's not there are a lot of things that I can be very grateful for. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1921.0s)]
*  And so when I make comments about these things, you know, I can only come from my own perspective. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1933.0s)]
*  But I do believe that we all have the light and the dark inside us. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1935.0s)]
*  Like the story of the wolf, you know, the story of the two wolves inside of us. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1941.0s)]
*  And, you know, which one survives is the one you feed. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1945.0s)]
*  You have the light wolf and the dark wolf. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1949.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they can you just constantly make decisions in order to feed the right wolf over time. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1951.0s)]
*  And some people get lost and they start feeding the wrong wolf. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1957.0s)]
*  And I I feel like I've been there before, too. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1960.0s)]
*  You know, I've gone through darkness and come out the other side, you know, in my own way, in my own, you know, in my own experience, you know, in my own pain, in my own heart. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1963.0s)]
*  You know, I think the one that's why I believe it's so important to reach people's hearts and why music is so powerful. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1975.0s)]
*  Yes, we all have a heart, you know, disregarding certain sociopathic people. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1982.0s)]
*  Yeah, we all for the most part, for the most part, we all have a heart. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1988.0s)]
*  And so that's where you reach, you know. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1994.0s)]
*  And I think sociopaths, you know, that's on a spectrum, too, is what we're hearing. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=1997.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? So you have people who can learn sociopathic behavior but aren't necessarily devoid of feeling. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2001.0s)]
*  Right. These people that become sociopaths or survive, I bet. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2007.0s)]
*  Exactly. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm sure. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2010.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. Yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2012.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's not that clear cut. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2014.0s)]
*  And, you know, to demonize people is that's the instinct. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2016.0s)]
*  Right. That's that's how wars get started. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2021.0s)]
*  We other an entire group of humans. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2023.0s)]
*  They're the other, you know, and I think this is tribal society behavior that developed because at one point in time when you saw someone from another tribe that was invading, they were coming to steal your resources and kill people. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2027.0s)]
*  Yes. And that's what people did. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2042.0s)]
*  And again, that also there's an exception to that in the sense that, like, for example, in Germany, you know, there were there were clear cut decisions that people had to make about survival and about, you know, like, I'm sorry, but the Nazis had to go. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2044.0s)]
*  Right. You know, we can't we can't just say that, you know, they're good people. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2064.0s)]
*  No, everyone's the same. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2068.0s)]
*  You know, they're they're so far gone. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2069.0s)]
*  Right. That they just have to go. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2072.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's there are certain, you know, examples of that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2074.0s)]
*  So it's not like you're you don't you don't have to forgive people. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2078.0s)]
*  You just have to understand them. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2081.0s)]
*  I think. Yeah, that's what that's why people call that the last great war or the real war. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2083.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, because it's like there was like such a clear cut case of good and evil. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2088.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's I mean, look, that I think the military industrial complex has been around since even before then. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2093.0s)]
*  But oh, for sure. Well, Smetley Butler wrote about it in 1933. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2100.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So anyways, that's where that's where Bob Dylan comes in. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2104.0s)]
*  You know, Masters of War. You know, you know, look, man, I'm again. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2107.0s)]
*  That's also why mushrooms are illegal. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2112.0s)]
*  Is it really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2114.0s)]
*  Mushrooms were made illegal during the Nixon administration because they wanted to figure out a way to stop the antiwar protests. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2115.0s)]
*  They wanted to figure out a way they turned everything schedule one. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2122.0s)]
*  They took all the psychedelics and lumped them into a schedule one because they wanted to go after civil rights activists and antiwar activists. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2126.0s)]
*  Right. That was the main reason like this is the best way to lock these people up. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2133.0s)]
*  Well, and interestingly. Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, right, because the thing is, is that there are a lot of studies like about marijuana now that say, OK, it could be harmful. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2137.0s)]
*  Right. They come out. But then at the same time. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2150.0s)]
*  There is the way that those that that's harmful. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2154.0s)]
*  And then, you know, comparatively to the other things that are legal and allowed to just propagate whiskey or cigarettes. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2158.0s)]
*  You know, like, I mean, like, you know, you have it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2166.0s)]
*  There's obviously a bias against that you can see clearly. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2170.0s)]
*  And obviously it came from this. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2175.0s)]
*  Well, it's also who's funding these studies. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2178.0s)]
*  Right. And what what did they look for when they're funding these studies? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2181.0s)]
*  And did they have it was their bias attached to these studies? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2185.0s)]
*  Like, what what does this mean? You know, like, I know a lot of people who use marijuana. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2189.0s)]
*  It's not harmful to them at all. So did you include those people in that study? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2193.0s)]
*  Like, and then I know people that use marijuana and it really does over consumes their life. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2196.0s)]
*  They overindulge. Yeah, I had to stop. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2202.0s)]
*  What was what was happening with you with it? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2205.0s)]
*  Well, I had to stop for many reasons. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2207.0s)]
*  I wanted to be clear headed. I started exercising a lot. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2213.0s)]
*  You know, I got my whoop, you know, I got my whoop right here. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2218.0s)]
*  You know, I started tracking my sleep. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2222.0s)]
*  And I funny enough, the sleep is really what got me the most, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2224.0s)]
*  because every time I take a hit or take one drink, my sleep would go to shit. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2229.0s)]
*  It's amazing when you look at the results. Oh, my God. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2234.0s)]
*  It was intense. And so and, you know, I started working out heavy and I really I had a lot of great like, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2237.0s)]
*  you know, I have a high good engine, you know, I'm Vio too. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2244.0s)]
*  And like I was like, you know, I really started to feel like an athlete again and started feel I started to feel great. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2249.0s)]
*  I started to get addicted to the high that I would get saying no of being proud of myself, having discipline and having the discipline. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2254.0s)]
*  I love the high that I get from exercising discipline. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2263.0s)]
*  I'm addicted to that. That's a good thing to be addicted to. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2268.0s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. Right. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2271.0s)]
*  Do you get addicted to that feeling that you get that's like, you know, like Goggins, he talks about, you know, all carrot, no stick. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2272.0s)]
*  Right. Or I'll stick. No carrot. Can't remember which one it is. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2280.0s)]
*  Right. But the thing is, is that for me, the reward is the high that I get from having discipline. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2283.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I get a it's a dopamine hit, you know, and it's it's just vastly more rewarding than than the whatever temporary thing I'll get from having a drink. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2291.0s)]
*  I don't know, like like drinking that much. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2303.0s)]
*  But smoking weed was cool because it put me into a very like creative spot and kind of gave me this surge of inspiration, if you will. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2305.0s)]
*  But it's bad for my lungs. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2312.0s)]
*  And there were a lot of ups and downs emotionally. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2314.0s)]
*  I'd get high and I get low and I get high and I get low. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2318.0s)]
*  And and and and now this clarity that I have is just it's incredible. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2321.0s)]
*  You know, I just it's just this steady, you know, it's the steady sort of joy, you know, that I I have because I had to face myself to when you get clear, you have to things come up and then you look at them and you're like and things that you didn't want to look at before. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2327.0s)]
*  You know, yeah. Habits that you had or things in your past that you have to forgive yourself for that you didn't really there's like floating in the back of your mind is unfinished thoughts. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2344.0s)]
*  And so with without it, all of that masking, I was able to sit and I mean, look, I was able to sit and write this record, which is the most clear album I've ever, you know, it wanted to know who I was throughout. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2354.0s)]
*  Throughout the. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2369.0s)]
*  Without all the you know, I didn't I didn't want to chase a six minute guitar solo. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2372.0s)]
*  I didn't want to chase. I wanted to just figure out who I was stripped away from all that. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2378.0s)]
*  It's funny. There's this guy, Marcus Dowling. He's a work writes for the Tennessean and I was sitting talking to him in Nashville. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2382.0s)]
*  And he was he said that when I put he he had it. He was raised and listen to my record and he was about to have a whiskey. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2391.0s)]
*  And he first the first song comes up and he puts his whiskey down. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2398.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, I don't want to drink for this. And I think that music puts you in the state of mind that the artist is in when they recorded it or when they wrote it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2402.0s)]
*  So this this it's it's kind of almost like interesting that he decided to put his drink down when you heard this out, like the first song, because like that's where I'm at. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2411.0s)]
*  You know, and so I wonder if there's that feeling of like this kind of like it's less of a jam band thing, more of just like straight songs. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2420.0s)]
*  And there's probably definitely something to that, because I think that's something that happens when someone's on stage performing. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2428.0s)]
*  It's like you let them take over your mind. You know, you let the music. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2434.0s)]
*  Yeah, song. It's like creating a holographic bubble that you're all participating in this. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2439.0s)]
*  Yeah, this vibe vibe. Yeah. And it's I mean, you were there at the McConaughey thing. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2445.0s)]
*  It was an electric feeling. Right. It was pretty wild. It was wild. Yeah, it was awesome. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2451.0s)]
*  And I felt like, you know, it was cool to see everyone there and just like, you know, it just felt like the added thing to that, that, you know, they do that every year and it's a charity. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2456.0s)]
*  Yeah. All the money goes to giving back. Yeah. And a lot of charities. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2468.0s)]
*  There's like five different charities that they're given to with McConaughey. He's a good guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2472.0s)]
*  He's a very wise man, especially for someone who's an actor. Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2479.0s)]
*  A lot of them. And that's again, that's a thing that I have to get over because I was around so many of them in L.A. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2484.0s)]
*  that were fools that I just immediately associate acting with like these empty vessels that are just struggling for attention and trying to say the things that they think will get them the best spot. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2490.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think that, look, I mean, to become an entertainer, there's a level of, you know, self-absorption that you have to sort of like accept. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2507.0s)]
*  All right. I got a big ego. Now, can I keep my ego in check for my whole life? Like I think my dad has, you know? Right. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2522.0s)]
*  I mean, I see my dad as a great example. I see Paul Simon as a great example. Right. I see, you know, Neil and, you know, I see these people that like, that they're just they're just artists through and through. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2529.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. And, you know, for better or worse, not perfect people, but they are who they are. And they, for the most part, I know my dad has an ego, but he has a good relationship with it because the ego is just the representation of who we are to the rest of us. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2541.0s)]
*  And of who we are to the rest of the world, you know? Well, everyone has an ego. Yeah, we all do. And the struggle with the ego is just like the struggle of with good and evil. I think part of it is necessary for you to overcome. Yeah. You need that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2558.0s)]
*  You need those. And you also need to see people fall prey to it. And we see that a lot. Ren, there's an artist named Ren. No. Oh, man. You'd love his work. He's like a, he plays guitar and he sings amazing. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2571.0s)]
*  Ren. Ren? He's from England. He's from Wales. He's Welsh. And he's, yeah, this guy. Yeah. So he's got a song called Higher End. Listen to Higher End. Yeah, this is the one. Here, put the headphones on. Okay. I've seen him for a while. He's like a, you start as a busker. Right? Oh, one of them dudes at the subway station. Yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2586.0s)]
*  This is a crazy song. It's about communicating with your ego. What a weird fucking start to a video. A guy with a pig mask on? Oh, man. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2611.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2641.0s)]
*  Hi there, Ren. It's been a little while. Did you miss me? You thought you buried me, didn't you? Risky. Cause I always come back. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2662.0s)]
*  Hi, Ren. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2689.0s)]
*  I've been taking some time to be distant. I've been taking some time to be still. I've been taking some time to be by myself since my therapist told me I'm ill. And I've been making some progress lately. And I've learned some new coping skills. So I haven't really needed you much, man. I think we need to just step back and chill. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2701.0s)]
*  Ren, you sound more insane than I do. You think that those doctors are really there to guide you? Been through this a million times. Your civilian mind is so perfect to always be in line to. Okay, take another pill, boy. Drown yourself in the sound of white noise. Follow this 10-step program. Rejoice. All your problems will be gone. Fucking dumb boy. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2718.0s)]
*  Nah, mate. This time is different, man. Trust me. I feel like things might be falling in place. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2734.0s)]
*  I think this is one of the problems with people that don't exercise. I think the struggle of exercise is oftentimes conflated with vanity. And I don't think it's that. I think you can keep your body covered up to the end of time and never be proud of it, and you will benefit greatly from the struggle of exercise. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2794.0s)]
*  Because I think the struggle of exercise is mental. As much as it is physical, there's a dance. When I talk to Goggins about it, he's the most bizarre of all cases. Because he's doing it all in silence. He's doing it all by himself. And occasionally he lets people peer into it. But it's going on right now. Right now that guy is out there running probably 30 miles today with destroyed knees. He's a real freak. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2816.0s)]
*  And when I talk to him about it, he's like, I'm downloading knowledge. That's what he says. He's like, I'm in the lab and I'm downloading knowledge. He's struggling in his own mind every day and forcing himself to do it every day. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2845.0s)]
*  And then he brings elite athletes to try to keep up with him occasionally. Like he brought Israel Adesanya. Israel Adesanya is a former UFC middleweight champion. Like one of the best fighters of all time. And you realize he can't even keep up with Dave. Not even close. This is one of multiple workouts that Dave is doing in a day. And this guy can't keep up with him. And Dave's 50. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2858.0s)]
*  What was the part of the brain that gets enlarged that Huberman was talking about that gets enlarged when you do things you don't want to do? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2883.0s)]
*  I always forget the name of it, but Jamie will pull it up. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2893.0s)]
*  Yeah. The anterior midcorp. I don't know what that is. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2895.0s)]
*  It should be like an easier name. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2900.0s)]
*  Cortex anterior. Something like that. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2903.0s)]
*  The discipline part. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2905.0s)]
*  Yeah. The disenlarges throughout your life when you do things that you force yourself to do. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2906.0s)]
*  Yeah. It literally does. It literally gets bigger, which is crazy. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2912.0s)]
*  What is it, Jamie? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2915.0s)]
*  Anterior midcigular cortex. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2917.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2920.0s)]
*  Nice. Success. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2921.0s)]
*  Midcigulate. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2924.0s)]
*  Midcigulate cortex. Yeah. Shout out to Andrew Huberman. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2925.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2929.0s)]
*  Doing things you don't want to do can strengthen your brain, particularly the anterior midcigulate cortex, which is associated with willpower and tenacity. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2930.0s)]
*  That's incredible that it actually grows. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2939.0s)]
*  So willpower is not just an airy fairy concept. It's like a muscle. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2942.0s)]
*  No. It's incredible that willpower can be also can be enhanced. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2949.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2954.0s)]
*  It just goes to brain plasticity. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2956.0s)]
*  That's a concept that I think a lot of people don't understand is that we are not set in who we are. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2961.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2969.0s)]
*  Especially if we adopt a growth mindset that we are never set in who we are. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2971.0s)]
*  We can always improve and refine the neural structure of our brain to where it works more efficiently. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2978.0s)]
*  Not just that, but you have to. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2988.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2990.0s)]
*  It never ends. There's never a time when you're done with discipline. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2991.0s)]
*  You don't just get it and now I have discipline. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2995.0s)]
*  No. Every day is a struggle. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2997.0s)]
*  Goggin said that. He goes, sometimes I stare at my sneakers for like a half hour before I put those motherfuckers on. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=2999.0s)]
*  Yeah. At like four in the morning, you know, every day. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3003.0s)]
*  But here's the thing is that it becomes a philosophical question because when you say you have to, you know, there are people who get by life, you know, and they there is a Tibetan tradition and that the monks do where they spend months and they take these little like flute things and they and they have colored sand. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3006.0s)]
*  Right. And they all sit in a circle and it takes them months sometimes to create this beautiful, intricate sand art and they chant while they do it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3027.0s)]
*  And it's this most incredible thing. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3037.0s)]
*  And at the end, they go and they blow it all away. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3043.0s)]
*  And and it's meant to represent the impermanence of life. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3044.0s)]
*  But then it's meant to also pose the question, why make something so beautiful when it's going to be it when you know it's impermanent. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3049.0s)]
*  And I believe it goes back to the first thing we started talking about today, which is that meaning is everything in life and nothing really in life inherently has any meaning except the meaning we give it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3058.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3070.0s)]
*  Right. So you could go you could like go through life as sand on the beach that blows in the wind and you know, you know, one you wouldn't it wouldn't really mean much when you blow one way or another. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3071.0s)]
*  Yeah. But if you choose to give your life meaning and build a sandcastle and make it as intricate and beautiful as you can and make it like, you know, as detailed as possible, knowing that one day it's going to get washed away. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3085.0s)]
*  At the only person that it matters to is you in knowing that you did the best you could at that moment that the wave comes. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3099.0s)]
*  If that's true, they should never let anybody film them making those things. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3108.0s)]
*  They should never let anyone film them making those things, because then it becomes permanent. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3112.0s)]
*  Someone can see it forever. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3118.0s)]
*  Sure. But you know what I'm saying? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3121.0s)]
*  But again, I think it's for them anyways. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3124.0s)]
*  Yes. It's not for everyone else. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3127.0s)]
*  But like when you let people peer into that world and you film it, there's something about that like, oh, you just cheated it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3129.0s)]
*  Well, in a way it becomes permanent. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3135.0s)]
*  But it also I mean, is, you know, just because you see it happening. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3137.0s)]
*  Let's look at it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3142.0s)]
*  Can you find that? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3143.0s)]
*  Yeah, you sure you could find it on there. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3144.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not dismissing it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3145.0s)]
*  No, no, I think but I think it's an interesting question because something that lives in our subjective reality. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3147.0s)]
*  If you see a video of that happening, right, and then you grasp the concept of it and then that makes you consider that concept in yourself. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3153.0s)]
*  Understanding that, you know, that the meaning is a subjective experience anyways. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3161.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3169.0s)]
*  Then now you understand like, OK, what you do, it just causes one to ask the question to themselves. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3170.0s)]
*  And I think that's the purpose that the monks are, you know, they're they're there is sort of like in a way they're teachers, you know. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3175.0s)]
*  So they show you something that like then you ask, you know, inside. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3186.0s)]
*  So what you were saying was that in response to the idea that everyone should exercise and. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3187.0s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3192.0s)]
*  Discipline. Yeah. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3193.0s)]
*  Well, but it's like you don't have to do that. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3194.0s)]
*  But your life will have you will experience a different sense of meaning. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3196.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3202.0s)]
*  You know, if you do that and that will I think that's enough for me at least because I'm driven by finding a sense of meaning. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3203.0s)]
*  And I think maybe because of how I grew up, you know, maybe others aren't driven by that, you know. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3211.0s)]
*  I think that's really important to say, too, because you never know. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3216.0s)]
*  Like what what is driving one? Right. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3220.0s)]
*  I don't know how your brain works. Exactly. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3222.0s)]
*  I could only guess. Yeah. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3224.0s)]
*  I could only assume your brain works like mine. Sure. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3225.0s)]
*  And that's silly. That's a silly thing to assume. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3228.0s)]
*  Yeah, we don't even know if we see the same colors. Right. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3230.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's so beautiful. Isn't it? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3234.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3237.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3239.0s)]
*  And then they're going to fuck that up. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3241.0s)]
*  I wrote a piece once for God, it was Esquire or Maxima, one of those things about your body is like a sand castle. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3244.0s)]
*  Yeah. That you're you're building this body, but one day it will be eroded. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3252.0s)]
*  Now they're just sweeping it away. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3257.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then they like, well, they'll dump the sand. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3259.0s)]
*  Well, that's kind of cool, too, though. Isn't it? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3261.0s)]
*  It's kind of abstract as they swirl it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3264.0s)]
*  It's kind of beautiful, too. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3266.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think how long that took them. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3267.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. It must have taken forever. And they're scooping the sand up. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3269.0s)]
*  They scoop it up. Yeah. Look at that. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3272.0s)]
*  They're just doing it with like these little things. Wow. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3273.0s)]
*  They just tap on it. Look. Look at that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3275.0s)]
*  Wow. That's beautiful. Yeah. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3277.0s)]
*  That's kind of amazing. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3279.0s)]
*  I've always loved this, that concept. Right. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3281.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, yeah, maybe they shouldn't let you film it for them. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3284.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm like, I'm glad they did. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3289.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they're letting people watch it. Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3291.0s)]
*  And, you know, just allowing people to see what the whole thing is. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3294.0s)]
*  It'll allow more people to understand the concept. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3298.0s)]
*  Well, that's kind of like Alan Watts, like always says, you know, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3301.0s)]
*  don't listen to what I'm saying. Right. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3304.0s)]
*  Because the Dao that can be spoken is not the real Dao. Right. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3306.0s)]
*  And yet here I am just loving the sound of my own voice and talking about it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3310.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? And like, you know, so it's like, you know, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3314.0s)]
*  that's the great paradox of the spiritual self and understanding what that means. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3318.0s)]
*  Well, that becomes readily apparent after you have a psychedelic experience. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3326.0s)]
*  I remember one of my first ones that I had, I realized when I was trying to describe it, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3330.0s)]
*  like I'm trying to impress people with the way I use my words. I was very aware. Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3333.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm trying to impress people with my grasp of language [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3338.0s)]
*  that I'm using to describe an experience. And I was like, oh, that's kind of gross. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3342.0s)]
*  One of the great, of course, actually, when I started listening to you, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3347.0s)]
*  it was in like 2007, 2006. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3352.0s)]
*  And it was, I was listening to a lot of Terrence McKenna at the time. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3357.0s)]
*  And Terrence McKenna, talk about someone who had a grasp on the English language. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3363.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, he was amazing. What an incredible, yeah. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3367.0s)]
*  Like I'd listen to his lectures, you know, that were available online. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3370.0s)]
*  Psychedelic Salon is the best resource. That's still up, right? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3374.0s)]
*  Lorenzo from Psychedelic Salon, who had been on the podcast before, back in the day. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3378.0s)]
*  He's collected like the greatest assembly of McKenna, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3383.0s)]
*  Ram Dass, probably. Yes. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3390.0s)]
*  There's a Ram Dass conversation, I think, with Alan Watts. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3391.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Somewhere out there, which is really interesting. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3396.0s)]
*  Well, my friend Duncan became friends with Ram Dass. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3399.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually met him in Hawaii one time. Really? Yeah, I got to meet him. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3401.0s)]
*  Yeah, Psychedelic Salon. So it is psychedelicsalon.com. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3406.0s)]
*  And there's Lorenzo. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3412.0s)]
*  And Psychedelic Salon is like this incredible resource of all the McKenna lectures. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3415.0s)]
*  I mean, he has, because it's such a great resource, so many people who were there [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3422.0s)]
*  at like, you know, some talk that he gave in Hawaii at some conference room somewhere [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3427.0s)]
*  recorded it, and then they would send that to Lorenzo. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3432.0s)]
*  And then he'd put it online and have it available for everybody. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3435.0s)]
*  And, you know, some amazing insights and conversations. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3438.0s)]
*  He lived not too far from where I live in Maui. So I went on a whale watch with him one time. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3443.0s)]
*  Really? With McKenna? No, with Ram Dass. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3452.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Oh, OK. OK. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3455.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not McKenna. I think McKenna died when I was a kid, like really early. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3457.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he died in... Was it 95 or something? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3462.0s)]
*  No, it was a little later than that. Oh. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3465.0s)]
*  What year did McKenna die? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3468.0s)]
*  You're Jamie, right? Yeah. Jamie. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3472.0s)]
*  I'm 2000. 2000? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3474.0s)]
*  I heard you play golf. I do. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3476.0s)]
*  And you were in a simulator earlier. I was. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3478.0s)]
*  I was in a simulator last night to like... His hands are blistered. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3481.0s)]
*  My hands all blistered out. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3484.0s)]
*  I had that. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3486.0s)]
*  We were having a conversation while we were getting espresso, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3487.0s)]
*  and I was saying I can't play music for the same reason I can't play golf. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3490.0s)]
*  Right. And then he shows me his hands. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3494.0s)]
*  So he's... We're all like... [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3496.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, that's what he was just doing back there. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3498.0s)]
*  Jamie's got this... He's got the bug. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3501.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's got it bad. He wants to fuck his friends up. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3503.0s)]
*  It's fun. Yeah. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3506.0s)]
*  It is a fun game. It's fun to make people mad. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3507.0s)]
*  That's a weird motivation. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3512.0s)]
*  But, okay. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3514.0s)]
*  Well, you know. Yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3515.0s)]
*  There's... It's funny, like... [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3517.0s)]
*  The closest friends we have are sometimes, you know, the ones we give the most shit, though. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3520.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3525.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3526.0s)]
*  Well, they're the ones that know you love them, so you can give them shit. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3527.0s)]
*  So you can kind of... Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3529.0s)]
*  And it's fun. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3530.0s)]
*  There's nothing like that feeling of like having a friend that can take it and dole it out. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3531.0s)]
*  Oh, that's why I love comedians. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3537.0s)]
*  They're the best. Right, right, right. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3538.0s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3540.0s)]
*  Because you shit on them, they love it. They shit on themselves. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3541.0s)]
*  Everyone's having fun. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3543.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3544.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3545.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's one of the great joys in life, I think. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3546.0s)]
*  Yeah, the people that can't take that. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3548.0s)]
*  Boy, you're missing out on a giant chunk of what it means to be a person. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3550.0s)]
*  If you're so sensitive, you can't let people crack on you. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3553.0s)]
*  Like, that's so silly. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3556.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. Yeah, exactly. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3557.0s)]
*  You're missing out on a lot of the fun. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3560.0s)]
*  You're missing out on half the laughs. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3561.0s)]
*  Because half the laughs are at your own expense. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3563.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3565.0s)]
*  You should be able to... [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3566.0s)]
*  I probably laughed harder at myself than at anyone else in my life, probably. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3567.0s)]
*  That's a healthy perspective, then. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3572.0s)]
*  Then you're a fairly healthy person. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3574.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's funny. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3576.0s)]
*  You know, we're running around, you know, trying to find meaning in life. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3577.0s)]
*  And, you know, one day, you know... [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3582.0s)]
*  Like, one day is a crazy thought. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3585.0s)]
*  But one day, the last remembrance of the human experience will happen. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3587.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3592.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3593.0s)]
*  Shit, it might be in our lifetime. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3595.0s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3597.0s)]
*  I think it'll be... [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3598.0s)]
*  I think it'll be... [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3599.0s)]
*  Because even now, we're uploaded into the AI system, you know? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3600.0s)]
*  So, like, something will survive, you know? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3604.0s)]
*  Something. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3606.0s)]
*  Yeah, something. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3607.0s)]
*  Well, whatever we are will lead to whatever comes next. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3608.0s)]
*  There's a great episode of Star Trek called The Inner Light. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3611.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3616.0s)]
*  The first Star Trek? The real one? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3617.0s)]
*  The next generation. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3618.0s)]
*  Oh, that's bullshit, Star Trek. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3619.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3621.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3623.0s)]
*  Them's fighting words, man. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3625.0s)]
*  You're a Picard guy? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3627.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, I'm a Picard guy. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3628.0s)]
*  I'd vote for him right now. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3629.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3631.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, he probably could win. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3632.0s)]
*  Diplomacy, man. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3634.0s)]
*  So this is The Inner Light? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3635.0s)]
*  The Inner Light. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3637.0s)]
*  Here's the story. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3638.0s)]
*  Okay, here's the story. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3639.0s)]
*  They come across a probe, all right? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3640.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3642.0s)]
*  Because they're exploring space, obviously, if you don't know Star Trek. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3643.0s)]
*  They're exploring space and the whole... [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3645.0s)]
*  Their whole mission is to go where no man has gone before. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3647.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3652.0s)]
*  And so they find this probe, and as they're scanning the probe, it zaps Picard, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3653.0s)]
*  and he goes unconscious, and he wakes up on this world where he remembers the spaceship. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3658.0s)]
*  He remembers where he was, but he's got a wife and a family and kids, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3665.0s)]
*  and this world is being threatened by an exploding sun. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3669.0s)]
*  And so he's got a lot of scientific knowledge. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3672.0s)]
*  So he, over the next 20 years in this world... [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3675.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3678.0s)]
*  He eventually grows old and accepts his fate that he has no idea how he got here, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3679.0s)]
*  but he's got to live this life now, and he starts to love his wife and his kids. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3685.0s)]
*  He starts to try and save this planet from the exploding sun. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3689.0s)]
*  He ends up not being able to. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3692.0s)]
*  And then as he dies, he wakes up back on the spaceship, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3694.0s)]
*  with only 20 seconds having gone by on the spaceship. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3700.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3704.0s)]
*  And the probe had been sent by that civilization. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3705.0s)]
*  They knew they were going to be destroyed, so they uploaded this thing [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3710.0s)]
*  that would let Picard experience what happened to their civilization and tell their story. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3714.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3720.0s)]
*  And he experienced a lifetime of 20 or 25 years before he died, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3721.0s)]
*  in the span of 20 seconds, and then woke up at the moment of his death in that other life, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3728.0s)]
*  and then was able to now tell the story of this forgotten civilization in space. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3732.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3739.0s)]
*  It's the coolest concept ever. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3740.0s)]
*  Okay, I'll have to watch it now. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3742.0s)]
*  I mean, I just told you, so... [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3744.0s)]
*  Sounds like art. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3746.0s)]
*  Do you know who Joseph McGonigal is? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3748.0s)]
*  No. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3753.0s)]
*  Joseph McGonigal was like... [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3754.0s)]
*  He was remote viewer number one. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3756.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3759.0s)]
*  He was the first guy. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3760.0s)]
*  And they gave him an assignment once, without him knowing where he was looking into. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3761.0s)]
*  And what it turned out, he was looking into Mars one million years ago. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3770.0s)]
*  And when he looked into Mars a million years ago, Mars was falling apart. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3778.0s)]
*  And there were beings on Mars that were going into hibernation, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3785.0s)]
*  they had built pyramids and all these structures, and they had to leave Mars, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3788.0s)]
*  because Mars was being destroyed, their atmosphere was being destroyed, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3792.0s)]
*  and they had to come to Earth. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3795.0s)]
*  And what he surmised from that is that what we are is the children of the people of Mars. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3797.0s)]
*  That's why we're so different from all the other primates. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3805.0s)]
*  There's a whole movie dedicated to that exact premise. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3808.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3811.0s)]
*  Called Mission to Mars. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3812.0s)]
*  Who's in it? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3813.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3814.0s)]
*  Is it Greg Kinnear, maybe? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3815.0s)]
*  Greg Kinnear. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3817.0s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3818.0s)]
*  For real? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3819.0s)]
*  Let's look at it, because it's like a great movie, and it's about that at the end. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3820.0s)]
*  I might have seen it, and I wouldn't have figured it out. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3822.0s)]
*  Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3824.0s)]
*  Gary Sinise. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3826.0s)]
*  Don Cheadle. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3827.0s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3828.0s)]
*  2000. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3829.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mission to Mars. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3830.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can see it. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3832.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's exactly the premise of the entire movie. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3834.0s)]
*  And so the premise of the movie is that these people... [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3837.0s)]
*  They go on a mission to Mars, they see like a structure on the surface of Mars, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3840.0s)]
*  so they go and they check it out. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3844.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3846.0s)]
*  And then like, that's the whole thing. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3847.0s)]
*  And they realize that Mars... [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3849.0s)]
*  Well, you know, this is not outside of the realm of possibility. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3851.0s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3855.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons why I say that is like, they've found recent... [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3856.0s)]
*  They've recently found structures on Mars that are so obviously man-made [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3859.0s)]
*  that it's almost impossible to deny. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3866.0s)]
*  Like, I showed it to Elon, and he was like, oh, we should go look at it. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3868.0s)]
*  Okay, but here's the thing about like... [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3871.0s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3873.0s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3874.0s)]
*  Show them the square on Mars. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3875.0s)]
*  So there's this... [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3878.0s)]
*  In the 1970s, they took satellite photos of what looked like a face on Mars in Sidonia. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3880.0s)]
*  I remember. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3886.0s)]
*  And it's kind of weird, kind of weird, but it's hard to say if that's... [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3887.0s)]
*  Like, there's things on Earth that look like faces, and it's just like... [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3890.0s)]
*  It's just a natural formation. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3893.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3895.0s)]
*  But then they found this. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3896.0s)]
*  This is recent. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3897.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3898.0s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck is that, man? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3899.0s)]
*  Look at those right angles. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3901.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3903.0s)]
*  That's on Mars. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3904.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3905.0s)]
*  And... [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3907.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3908.0s)]
*  That may have been a structure at one point in time. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3909.0s)]
*  It may have, yeah. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3911.0s)]
*  I mean, look... [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3912.0s)]
*  It's too complete. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3913.0s)]
*  It's too square. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3914.0s)]
*  It's a square. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3915.0s)]
*  I mean, look... [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3916.0s)]
*  It actually might be a rectangle, right? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3917.0s)]
*  Is it kind of a rectangle? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3919.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3920.0s)]
*  We'd have to measure it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3921.0s)]
*  I'm sure they could measure it throughout... [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3922.0s)]
*  I just... [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3925.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3926.0s)]
*  When I looked up remote viewing, for example, and I really looked and did research on it, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3927.0s)]
*  the studies that were done were kind of discredited about how the effectiveness of those actually [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3932.0s)]
*  were. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3939.0s)]
*  So if you really dive in, there's literature that says that it wasn't really... [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3940.0s)]
*  The reason that they... [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3946.0s)]
*  Apparently... [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3948.0s)]
*  Now, this is all conflicting information. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3949.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3952.0s)]
*  I had Hal put off on who was a remote viewer and who was involved in the remote viewer, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3953.0s)]
*  the Stargate program. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3957.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3958.0s)]
*  So what does he say about the idea that the actual studies were not that conclusive and [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3959.0s)]
*  that's why they... [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3966.0s)]
*  It depends on who's doing it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3967.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3968.0s)]
*  Who's doing it, what's the methodology. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3969.0s)]
*  But they were able to accurately find within a small radius a downed Russian spacecraft. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3970.0s)]
*  So a Russian spacecraft that re-entered orbit and crashed. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3979.0s)]
*  It was a spacecraft or an aircraft. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3982.0s)]
*  Do you remember, Jamie? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3984.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3986.0s)]
*  But they used remote viewers and the Russians couldn't find it and they found it. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3987.0s)]
*  And this is... [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3990.0s)]
*  You're talking about in like a vast expanse of wilderness. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3991.0s)]
*  It could have been anywhere. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3994.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3995.0s)]
*  But they found the area where it was. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3996.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3997.0s)]
*  They also found a Russian factory that was making an enormous nuclear submarine. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=3998.0s)]
*  They found it, accurately described it. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4004.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4007.0s)]
*  The dimensions of it. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4008.0s)]
*  They knew where it was. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4009.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4010.0s)]
*  And it was an accurate location. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4011.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4013.0s)]
*  It was a thing that was being hidden. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4014.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4016.0s)]
*  But where it was, the dimensions of it. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4019.0s)]
*  I don't dismiss it. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4020.0s)]
*  I can't dismiss anything. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4021.0s)]
*  I just know that when I looked up UFO experiences and this disclosure stuff that's happening [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4022.0s)]
*  lately and I'm a huge... [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4030.0s)]
*  I'm not just a believer. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4035.0s)]
*  I pray that there is someone out there disarming nuclear missiles. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4037.0s)]
*  Especially right now. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4043.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4045.0s)]
*  My great hope is that there is someone just trying to not step in but oversee it to the [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4046.0s)]
*  point where hopefully we can survive to a point of having an interstellar civilization. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4053.0s)]
*  It's the great dream of humanity, right? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4058.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4062.0s)]
*  But we have to be a different civilization than we are now. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4063.0s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4064.0s)]
*  Otherwise we're going to do the same shit in other places. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4065.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4066.0s)]
*  The thing is that, and that's what I... [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4067.0s)]
*  I was always, even before Elon was as famous as he is now, when I was like 15 I read his [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4069.0s)]
*  book. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4077.0s)]
*  And the one thing that I... [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4078.0s)]
*  I'm a friend of... [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4080.0s)]
*  What was his book? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4081.0s)]
*  He read... [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4082.0s)]
*  It was like a book about him maybe. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4083.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4084.0s)]
*  And I can't remember. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4085.0s)]
*  But what I really wanted the focus to be on was let's put all these resources into getting [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4086.0s)]
*  this planet right first. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4094.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4096.0s)]
*  Let's put everything we have. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4097.0s)]
*  And it felt at the time like, okay, well, yes, we're spending all this money to go off [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4099.0s)]
*  and maybe we're hopeless. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4105.0s)]
*  It's possible that we're hopeless. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4106.0s)]
*  And it sounds like that's where they err on this. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4108.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, well, humanity on Earth is just over. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4111.0s)]
*  We just have to go somewhere else. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4115.0s)]
*  But then if we go somewhere else, we're just going to do the same thing like you're saying. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4117.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4120.0s)]
*  All of the resources, in my opinion, should be focused on like... [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4122.0s)]
*  Like there's devices that they have invented that can be put in river mouths around the [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4125.0s)]
*  world to filter out pollution and plastics going into the ocean. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4133.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4138.0s)]
*  And it's like this incredible technology. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4139.0s)]
*  If the budgets were spent towards these innovations, you know, and maybe AI will help it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4141.0s)]
*  Right now, AI is kind of a tax on the planet in terms of like, you know, it's not very [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4148.0s)]
*  good for it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4154.0s)]
*  But maybe the AI technology itself will then invent something that makes itself more efficient [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4155.0s)]
*  for the planet. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4160.0s)]
*  What do you mean by AI is a tax on the planet? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4161.0s)]
*  Well, because the energy required for the servers and all of that is so... [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4162.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4166.0s)]
*  So, you know, it drains a lot of resource. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4167.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4170.0s)]
*  And so, but what AI may do is help us create like an ion battery or something that like [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4171.0s)]
*  makes energy give off less, you know, you can have this much more energy with way less [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4177.0s)]
*  heat and way less... [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4182.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4183.0s)]
*  And so then you can create, you know, instead of having to have giant warehouses full of [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4184.0s)]
*  servers, you can have just, you know, like, I mean, like it's the same stuff that happened [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4190.0s)]
*  with the computer. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4195.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4196.0s)]
*  Where the computer required a giant building when it was first created. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4197.0s)]
*  And now you have computers smaller than a... [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4201.0s)]
*  Just to be clear, Elon's position is not that Earth is like that humans are helpless or [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4204.0s)]
*  hopeless and we have to just leave Earth. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4208.0s)]
*  It's not that. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4210.0s)]
*  It's that life is so fragile here because of the possibility, not just of us fucking [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4211.0s)]
*  it up, but of natural disasters. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4217.0s)]
*  And that we need to become interstellar in order to propagate life and to survive. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4219.0s)]
*  And so we can carry on this growth that we're involved in as a human species. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4226.0s)]
*  Because there's... [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4232.0s)]
*  I mean, they just... [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4233.0s)]
*  What was the number that they just found? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4235.0s)]
*  A bunch of new asteroids? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4237.0s)]
*  Like, the possibility of us being hit by a near Earth object is extremely high over the [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4239.0s)]
*  next X amount of hundreds of years. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4245.0s)]
*  It's extremely high. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4248.0s)]
*  And these things might not wipe everything out, but they'll start civilization all over [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4249.0s)]
*  again. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4253.0s)]
*  They'll bring us back to cave people. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4254.0s)]
*  So the idea was that the more places that we are, the more likelihood that the human [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4255.0s)]
*  race survives. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4260.0s)]
*  It's not just that we're going to fuck this up. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4261.0s)]
*  And I appreciate wanting the human race to survive. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4264.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4267.0s)]
*  But it should be better than it is now. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4268.0s)]
*  I want us to learn our lessons on this planet. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4273.0s)]
*  And I think that that's even more important than surviving. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4274.0s)]
*  I mean, here's the thing. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4276.0s)]
*  When you ask yourself... [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4277.0s)]
*  When someone asks themselves, have I lived a life worth living? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4281.0s)]
*  Is a life worth living someone who lives a very long time? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4286.0s)]
*  Or is a life worth living someone who's lived a good life and maybe for shorter? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4291.0s)]
*  So what is the ultimate effect that humanity has on the natural world and environment? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4297.0s)]
*  Do we deserve to be spacefaring? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4303.0s)]
*  And if we do, then I say let's go. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4308.0s)]
*  But I mean, I think... [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4310.0s)]
*  Deserve by whose judgment? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4311.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, by my own individual judgment at this point. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4312.0s)]
*  But I mean, are we better than the lions who killed the gazelles? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4316.0s)]
*  No, but the lions... [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4320.0s)]
*  Everyone... [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4322.0s)]
*  All the natural world works cyclically. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4323.0s)]
*  The way that the lion kills the gazelle and the way that the alligator takes the... [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4325.0s)]
*  Tourist? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4332.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4333.0s)]
*  Everything works with balance in nature. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4334.0s)]
*  You have just enough give and take. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4338.0s)]
*  It's worked that way for years. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4340.0s)]
*  And then, yes, extinctions, events happen, and then things die out. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4342.0s)]
*  But there has never been a creature on the planet with the ability like we have to take as much resource as we can without replenishing that or balancing that out. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4346.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4361.0s)]
*  So we, I think, have a responsibility as humanity to understand how to balance ourselves with the... [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4362.0s)]
*  And harmonize with nature. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4369.0s)]
*  And I think that's where my great hope is, is that we figure out how to find a cyclical arrangement with nature. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4372.0s)]
*  Where we... [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4382.0s)]
*  Where just like photosynthesis, just like plants give us oxygen, and then, you know, the carbon dioxide we breathe, then the plants then sequester. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4383.0s)]
*  Well, our disconnection to nature might be a part of our disconnection to psychedelics. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4394.0s)]
*  That might be one of the reasons why we're disconnected, is we're lacking a crucial element that's there to humble the human species. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4399.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4407.0s)]
*  I think... [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4408.0s)]
*  That's the great key. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4409.0s)]
*  Humility. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4410.0s)]
*  That's part of it. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4411.0s)]
*  I think, I really do. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4412.0s)]
*  And I think that these monsters that were trying to silence the anti-war and the civil rights movement in the 1970s by making those things illegal. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4413.0s)]
*  They essentially, they hampered our development. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4422.0s)]
*  But not all of it, right? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4426.0s)]
*  So our technological development continued, but our spiritual development ceased. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4427.0s)]
*  Yeah, and intellect, devoid of wisdom, is dangerous. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4431.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4436.0s)]
*  Especially like overcome with ego. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4439.0s)]
*  And I think that intellect overcome with ego is like really disgusting. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4440.0s)]
*  And the thing about it is that no one believes they're a monster. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4443.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4448.0s)]
*  Everyone justifies their behavior. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4449.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4452.0s)]
*  And they think they're doing good. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4453.0s)]
*  I mean, with the exception of, like I said, a few sociopathic, completely devoid of empathy individuals, you know. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4454.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4461.0s)]
*  But for the most part, everyone justifies their behavior. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4466.0s)]
*  For themselves. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4467.0s)]
*  They judge themselves and then they somehow make it, well, because I'm doing this, because I'm doing this, you know, I can sleep at night. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4468.0s)]
*  And so they let themselves sleep at night. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4476.0s)]
*  And a lot of times they should be looking at themselves and changing, but they don't. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4483.0s)]
*  And like, so that's why my policy is I try to just always look at myself and see, is this actually beneficial for not just me, but for the people around me, you know. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4484.0s)]
*  And music has been one of the great things in life that is a win-win, you know. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4494.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4498.0s)]
*  It's always a win-win. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4499.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great way to look at it. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4500.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, wow, I'm so lucky to just be able to observe, be able to play, be able to sleep well. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4502.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're a chef for the soul. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4510.0s)]
*  You know, like a chef provides food. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4513.0s)]
*  It's a win-win. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4516.0s)]
*  People eat. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4517.0s)]

*  You enjoy the food. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4519.0s)]

*  It sustains you. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4521.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4522.0s)]
*  And music is, that's a lot of what a musician is. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4523.0s)]
*  You're a chef for the soul. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4525.0s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4526.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4527.0s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4535.0s)]
*  And Stevie Ray being here from Austin, I sort of had a special affinity for, even though Hendrix. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4536.0s)]
*  Stevie Ray is the only one who's allowed to do Voodoo Child, other than Hendrix. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4543.0s)]
*  I think you're probably right there, you know. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4548.0s)]
*  I mean, other people can. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4550.0s)]
*  I'm just joking around. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4551.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4552.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4554.0s)]

*  Kind of right. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4556.0s)]
*  Because he's the only one that I can listen to where I go, yeah, yeah, this is like a [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4557.0s)]
*  Stevie Ray version of Voodoo Child. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4560.0s)]
*  Well, and he was a disciple of Hendrix. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4562.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4565.0s)]
*  He was, you know, he really sat and, you know, and really lived that life. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4566.0s)]
*  And the thing that I learned that was the best lesson I learned, it goes back to why [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4571.0s)]
*  I am sober now and where I'm at, is because I think the greatest lie I ever believed for [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4575.0s)]
*  so long, I did 15 years on the road, you know, 250 shows a year. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4581.0s)]
*  And I told myself I had to live like my heroes in order to be, you know, and I think, I think [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4586.0s)]
*  that's what, it didn't kill Stevie Ray, but it derailed him for a long time before he [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4594.0s)]
*  got sober, you know. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4600.0s)]
*  Stevie Ray died in a tragic accident, obviously, it was, you know, just that's what happened. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4601.0s)]
*  I almost had a chance to drive him. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4606.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4608.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was driving limousines for this limousine company in Boston and we're supposed, he's [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4609.0s)]
*  supposed to take a limousine, but he wouldn't take limousines, he would take cabs. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4615.0s)]
*  He always wanted to take cabs. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4619.0s)]
*  So I drove this limousine, I drove Jeff Beck once, I drove Annie Lennox's crew. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4620.0s)]
*  I didn't drive Annie Lennox. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4626.0s)]
*  I love Annie Lennox, she's beautiful, she's amazing. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4627.0s)]
*  I went, I had to drop off the crew at this restaurant and Annie Lennox was talking and [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4629.0s)]
*  her voice was so powerful. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4635.0s)]
*  It was like, the way I described it, I was like, her vocal cords were made out of like [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4637.0s)]
*  piano wire because like her voice was carrying in the room and I was, at the time I was 20 [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4642.0s)]
*  maybe, and I remember like watching her talk, oh this is crazy, like this lady's voice is [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4649.0s)]
*  like traveling, like it has a different power than everyone else in the restaurant. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4656.0s)]
*  The voice is such an incredible thing, is it not? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4663.0s)]
*  The power of a vocal cord, like look at James Earl Jones. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4666.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4670.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4671.0s)]
*  You know, like to change. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4672.0s)]
*  Darth Vader by the way. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4673.0s)]

*  Yeah, he is Darth Vader. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4675.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he lived to be what, 95, something like that. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4676.0s)]
*  How long did he live? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4680.0s)]
*  He was crazy and he was still doing that. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4681.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, there are certain ones in the lifetime. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4684.0s)]
*  But Stevie Ray wouldn't take limousines, like fuck this limo. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4688.0s)]
*  He liked to talk to cab drivers, liked to get in the cab and he liked to just keep it [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4692.0s)]
*  real. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4697.0s)]
*  Even though he was a superstar, he didn't want to be treated like one, he just wanted [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4698.0s)]
*  to be normal. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4701.0s)]
*  Some of the best conversations I've ever had have been in like Ubers or Lifts or whatever, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4702.0s)]
*  just sitting and chatting about like where they're from and how they got there and like [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4708.0s)]
*  there's a lot of incredible stories of like perseverance. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4713.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4720.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4724.0s)]
*  I mean, and then, you know, everybody's got their own little journey and sometimes you [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4725.0s)]
*  dip into someone's journey and go, what are you doing, man? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4729.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4732.0s)]
*  What you up to? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4733.0s)]
*  I was trying to learn a little bit of the language too. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4734.0s)]
*  Like, how do you say this? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4736.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4737.0s)]
*  You know, there's something like, there's something that just makes people, I think, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4738.0s)]
*  really drop their defenses when you submit yourself with humility to learn their language. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4749.0s)]
*  Until I say, you know what? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4750.0s)]
*  I'm like, look, thank you for driving me. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4751.0s)]

*  Right, right, right, right. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4756.0s)]
*  How do you correctly pronounce your name? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4757.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4760.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I work for the UFC, so there's a lot of people that I have to ask them, tell [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4761.0s)]
*  me how to say your name, because some of these names are just insane. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4766.0s)]
*  Like some of the names from Dagestan or from Kazakhstan. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4770.0s)]
*  There's so many places where it's like Shavkat Rachmanov, like, Jesus Christ, like it takes [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4775.0s)]
*  forever. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4781.0s)]
*  And I have to, I can't fuck their names up. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4782.0s)]
*  No, I'm glad that you think that because that's a beautiful thing. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4784.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4787.0s)]
*  I'm fascinated by the different sounds that people choose to use as their language in [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4788.0s)]
*  different places. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4794.0s)]
*  It's like human beings evolved in all these different places with all these different [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4795.0s)]
*  ways of communicating. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4799.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4801.0s)]
*  They're all different. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4802.0s)]
*  What's the clicking in Africa? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4803.0s)]
*  There's a musician, and I can't remember for the life of me her name, which is maybe Angelique [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4806.0s)]
*  Kijil, but no, but she sings and she uses the clicks and then just does this sort of, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4811.0s)]
*  oh my gosh. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4818.0s)]
*  She uses the clicks in her singing. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4819.0s)]
*  In her music. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4821.0s)]
*  Oh, it's so beautiful. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4822.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4823.0s)]
*  You've got to wonder, like, what caused them to develop that kind of language? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4824.0s)]
*  You know, it's like they're all developing it in a vacuum, right? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4828.0s)]
*  Because they're all the people in that area, in that community, generation after generation [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4832.0s)]
*  after generation, all agree to communicate in a certain way. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4837.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4840.0s)]
*  You know, and then they run into people in China and you're like, Jesus, this is so different. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4841.0s)]
*  And in China, there's like, I don't know how many different dialects. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4845.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4848.0s)]
*  You know, and they're different, like completely different. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4849.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4851.0s)]
*  Well, my grandparents were from Italy and they spoke a Sicilian dialect. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4852.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm Sicilian too. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4855.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4856.0s)]
*  I'm other side, yeah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4857.0s)]
*  But I remember me like learning Italian in college. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4858.0s)]
*  And it was so different than the way that they were speaking Italian. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4863.0s)]
*  Well, and I think, I'm not certain, but Dean Martin had a specific, and it may have been [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4868.0s)]
*  Sicilian or maybe a specific Northern Italian or Napoli maybe. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4876.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4882.0s)]
*  And the way that he would sing Domenico Modugno's song, you know, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4883.0s)]
*  VOLARE, PENSO CHE UN SONNO COSI NON ME TORNA NI MAI. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4886.0s)]
*  VOLARE. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4890.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4892.0s)]
*  And he would do it and he'd go, he'd have these like slang. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4893.0s)]
*  In his version, it's quite different, the Italian, if you listen to both of them together. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4898.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4903.0s)]
*  Really interesting, yeah. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4904.0s)]
*  Yeah, the dialects are weird, right? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4905.0s)]
*  So it's like people learn how, well, I mean, look at America, right? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4907.0s)]
*  You can go to like New Orleans and people have a completely different way of talking [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4910.0s)]
*  than people do in New York City. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4915.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4917.0s)]
*  Have you heard about the new, speaking of AI, the new adventures that we're now embarking [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4918.0s)]
*  on, some scientists, they're like using AI to communicate with animals, like whales. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4925.0s)]
*  I saw that with cats. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4929.0s)]
*  I saw that today. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4931.0s)]
*  You saw that today? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4933.0s)]
*  Yes, AI is translating cat language with like 95% accuracy. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4934.0s)]
*  They think they know what cats are saying to each other now. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4940.0s)]
*  Do you think that will have an effect on how we treat animals if we're able to communicate with them? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4943.0s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4948.0s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you've seen dogs when people say, I love you, and they go, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4949.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4953.0s)]
*  You know, like, they're trying to say, I love you. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4954.0s)]
*  They just don't have the same lips. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4958.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they're very, dogs will, you know, they're very good at mimicking, you know, behavior. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4960.0s)]
*  Well, they certainly understand language, because I talk to my dog like a person. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4967.0s)]
*  I talk to him. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4971.0s)]
*  Like, I can say, come on, man, is it time to go outside? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4972.0s)]
*  What do you want to do? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4975.0s)]
*  You want to get crazy? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4976.0s)]
*  And they're like, hmm? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4977.0s)]
*  I'm going to go outside? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4978.0s)]
*  Like, he knows what I'm saying. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4980.0s)]
*  Like, I don't have to say it in a certain tone. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4982.0s)]
*  I can just say the words. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4984.0s)]
*  He knows, yeah. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4986.0s)]
*  It's funny, my dad, you know, Roger Miller, you ever hear of Roger Miller? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4987.0s)]
*  It's Roger Miller. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4990.0s)]
*  Trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let 50 cent. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4992.0s)]
*  You know, King of the Road? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4997.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4998.0s)]
*  King of the Road. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=4999.0s)]
*  So my dad and him were good friends, and he used to tell a lot of great jokes. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5001.0s)]
*  But one of them was, it's true, you start, what they say, you start looking like your dog. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5007.0s)]
*  I just got chewed out by the neighbor for shitting in their front yard. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5011.0s)]
*  My dad has so many amazing jokes. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5018.0s)]
*  Well, you, it must have been really interesting, the people that your dad brought around. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5022.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5028.0s)]
*  Because like, you know. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5029.0s)]
*  One of the greatest moments I ever felt like I was a part of was just a sort of a normal afternoon. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5030.0s)]
*  And I was in Hawaii, and I was at my parents' house there. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5040.0s)]
*  And it was me and dad were sitting around, and Chris Christopherson walks by and in behind, walks in. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5043.0s)]
*  They're on their way to the airport or coming from the airport or whatever. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5050.0s)]
*  And in walks in with him, Muhammad Ali. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5053.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5055.0s)]
*  And so I'm sitting there, and me and dad are just picking. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5056.0s)]
*  And Muhammad comes and sits down, and Chris is on one side of him, and dad's on the other. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5060.0s)]
*  And I'm the one who got the guitar. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5066.0s)]
*  And so we just start singing for him. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5068.0s)]
*  And he's shaking. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5071.0s)]
*  He can't speak really, you know. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5072.0s)]
*  But you could just see me and dad and Chris was just like serenading Muhammad Ali one afternoon. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5074.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5080.0s)]
*  And we sang Help Me Make It Through the Night. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5081.0s)]
*  We sang Always On My Mind. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5083.0s)]
*  I sang one of my songs, you know. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5085.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5086.0s)]
*  And so it was just like a beautiful afternoon. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5087.0s)]
*  I'll never forget that moment. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5090.0s)]
*  It must have been so strange to be constantly surrounded by these exceptional people. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5092.0s)]
*  Not just exceptional, but exceptional worldwide. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5097.0s)]
*  Like the way they're received worldwide. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5099.0s)]
*  Like these are like iconic humans. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5101.0s)]
*  Like Chris Christopherson is like an iconic human being. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5103.0s)]
*  Muhammad Ali is an iconic human being. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5106.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5108.0s)]
*  And the key language there is human being. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5109.0s)]
*  Well-rounded. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5117.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5118.0s)]
*  Thoughtful. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5119.0s)]
*  Empathetic. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5121.0s)]
*  I mean wise. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5122.0s)]
*  Wise. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5123.0s)]
*  And these people are, you know, they made their life, their work. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5125.0s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix I think was famous in saying that you, you know, your art isn't just the music. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5129.0s)]
*  It's your life. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5135.0s)]
*  You make your life the work of art. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5138.0s)]
*  And that's what, I mean he had no problem with all the colors that he used in his whole life. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5139.0s)]
*  He had no problem expressing himself in many other forms other than, you know, in how he dressed and how he worked. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5144.0s)]
*  You know, everything was an expression of who he was in his art. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5151.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5155.0s)]
*  And I, you know, I'm grateful to have been exposed to a lot of those people in my life. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5160.0s)]
*  It's just a very exceptional childhood in that regard, right? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5161.0s)]
*  Because for some people they grow up and I remember the first time I ever met like a really famous person I was like whoa, this is weird. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5164.0s)]
*  You know, like it was probably my, other than like seeing Jeff Beck and seeing Annie Lennox. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5170.0s)]
*  I never really met them. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5175.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't really start meeting famous people until I became a comedian. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5176.0s)]
*  And then really meeting famous people until I got on television. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5180.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5183.0s)]
*  And then it was just, it was odd. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5184.0s)]
*  It was just so odd. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5186.0s)]
*  It was, and still to this day sometimes I'll have someone in here like had Bono in here. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5187.0s)]
*  And it's just weird to me. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5191.0s)]
*  Like one of my first Bono memories I was like 25 years ago I was doing mushrooms and I was listening to In God's Country. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5193.0s)]
*  I got to tell that to Bono. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5199.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5201.0s)]
*  It was like one of the wildest versions of your songs like looking out over this canyon while that song was playing. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5202.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful though. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5208.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5209.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful memory. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5210.0s)]
*  But it's just weird, you know, to just accept that they're human beings because you see them on television. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5211.0s)]
*  You see them in all these things and you grow to realize like oh, we're all just human beings. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5218.0s)]
*  And like that's part of the lesson of it is to meet someone who you don't think is just a human being. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5223.0s)]
*  And you realize like oh, all of us are human beings. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5228.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great lesson. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5231.0s)]
*  And when I think that I was able to understand fame and its trappings at a young age, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5233.0s)]
*  that's something I'm also very grateful for that I was able to see like okay, a lot of dads, friends, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5240.0s)]
*  a lot of the people that I grew up around didn't make it very long because they got into this or they got into that. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5247.0s)]
*  And I see it all happening a lot to a lot of young people that are unable to handle fame. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5254.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5261.0s)]
*  And fame is not inherently a good thing. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5262.0s)]
*  I think it's actually probably a net negative, although it's a necessary thing if you want your art to get out to as many people as possible [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5265.0s)]
*  or if you want to create a living. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5272.0s)]
*  Like I don't depend on my parents, so I want my music to get out there so that I'll have a career when I'm 90. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5274.0s)]
*  I want to be playing, you know, I don't want to, I mean eventually I have to keep making a living. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5280.0s)]
*  So you have to be a little famous. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5286.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have to. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5288.0s)]
*  You think there's a part of you that, you know, part of the entertainment world where you have to make sure, you have to put yourself out there. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5297.0s)]
*  And that's kind of despite knowing that when you put yourself out there, then all the, you know, you get unwanted attention too. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5298.0s)]
*  I think one of the worst things about it is the scammers on the internet. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5306.0s)]
*  There's so many scammers now on Instagram and Facebook and everyone, and they prey on elderly people. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5311.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5318.0s)]
*  And they prey on... [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5319.0s)]
*  You mean the scam pretend they're you? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5320.0s)]
*  They pretend that they're me. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5322.0s)]
*  And they go out there and these people are, I think they're the lowest form on this planet really. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5323.0s)]
*  Because these are people that have dementia issues. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5330.0s)]
*  They have, you know, they're elderly, you know, and they prey on that demographic specifically because they know that they're more gullible and don't understand technology. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5333.0s)]
*  And they think that I'm talking to them and they'll give in some cases thousands and thousands of dollars of their own savings in my name. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5345.0s)]
*  And that has almost made me get off the internet many times. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5352.0s)]
*  But even so, what happens when I get off is then they just run rampant. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5357.0s)]
*  You know, they create new accounts and then the people that are, you know, sort of... [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5362.0s)]
*  And they don't want to believe it's not me. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5366.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5368.0s)]
*  You know, and so like the people that are caught in it get caught and they get hooked, you know. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5369.0s)]
*  I remember watching this documentary once and it was about people that get scammed romantically online. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5374.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5380.0s)]
*  And there's this guy who is this lonely man who is in his 60s. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5381.0s)]
*  And he had this girlfriend that he was communicating with in Europe that was non-existent. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5385.0s)]
*  And he flew over there twice to meet her and every time she conveniently couldn't meet him. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5391.0s)]
*  Totally. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5396.0s)]
*  And his daughter was trying to explain to him that it wasn't real, that he was getting scammed, that he didn't want to believe it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5397.0s)]
*  And in the documentary you could see like this guy like coming to grips with it but not wanting to believe it. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5405.0s)]
*  And like, oh, something just came up. She couldn't go. She loves me. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5411.0s)]
*  It's the saddest thing. That just happened to us recently. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5414.0s)]
*  I played a show with Eric Church at Chiefs and I had a bunch of friends there and everything. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5417.0s)]
*  And we had someone show up at the door saying that they had been given, they had been put on the list by me, that I was in a relationship with that person. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5421.0s)]
*  You sure they weren't just schizophrenic? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5431.0s)]
*  Well, these people are in some cases schizophrenic or they have Alzheimer's or dementia or memory issues or whatever. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5433.0s)]
*  But a lot of times they're just being catfished, you know. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5440.0s)]
*  I mean, I've seen, there is that show, Catfish, that was on TV not too long ago. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5445.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's still around. But these are otherwise sort of normal people that get tricked into believing they're in a relationship and they have a girlfriend and they're online and they get to the place. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5451.0s)]
*  And these are like sometimes younger people that even get, it just shows you how easily sometimes even intelligent people can be manipulated. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5461.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5470.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's just the perils of dealing with this non-material world, dealing with the internet world. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5471.0s)]
*  I mean, and I'm sure it happened in some ways back in the day, you know, with letters and things like that. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5478.0s)]
*  It happened with everything. I mean, snake oil salesman. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5484.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5486.0s)]
*  I was reading, oh, no, I was watching Cody Tucker today. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5487.0s)]
*  He had something about this guy who was treating people for cataracts and it didn't really treat them. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5491.0s)]
*  It actually blinded them. And he had done it to two different famous composers. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5498.0s)]
*  This one guy was like, and he was a traveling guy. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5504.0s)]
*  He would go from town to town and do things like that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5507.0s)]
*  There's always been people like that. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5510.0s)]
*  I mean, and you ask yourself, do those people have any like conscience? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5512.0s)]
*  You know, at that, at a certain point, what are they telling themselves to justify their behavior? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5518.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably just getting by and probably they've been fucked over to. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5524.0s)]
*  Most of those people have been fucked over to the point where they can justify fucking over other people. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5528.0s)]
*  Like those people have it coming. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5533.0s)]
*  You know, someone did it to me. I'm going to do it to them. This is the game we play. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5535.0s)]
*  What is the antidote to that? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5539.0s)]
*  You know, I think those people exist so you can appreciate people that don't do that. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5541.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think that's where like heartless, nasty, vicious people exist. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5548.0s)]
*  So if you've ever been in a relationship with someone who's just like a real shithead, just mean, nasty, insulting, gaslighty. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5554.0s)]
*  Yeah. And trying to diminish you as a person. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5562.0s)]
*  And then you meet someone who's not like that and you're like, oh, if I didn't know someone who sucked, maybe I wouldn't appreciate this person. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5565.0s)]
*  Totally. You know, and like that's the beauty. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5572.0s)]
*  Like one time me and my friend Brian, we went on this hunting trip with my friend Steve Rinella to this island in Alaska. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5575.0s)]
*  We were there for a week getting rained on every day. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5585.0s)]
*  It was miserable, just freezing, shivering every day for a week. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5587.0s)]
*  Then I came back to L.A. and the sun felt so good. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5592.0s)]
*  It never felt that good. I've been living in L.A. for 25 fucking years. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5598.0s)]
*  It never felt that good. But I appreciate the sun. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5601.0s)]
*  Why did I appreciate the sun? Because I had just been rained on for a week. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5604.0s)]
*  I had taken it for granted. This beautiful, amazing sunlight that I just go, oh, it's fucking sunny day. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5607.0s)]
*  Where's my sunglasses? Let me drive to work and get inside real quick because it's too fucking bright out. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5615.0s)]
*  You know, and I didn't. But because of the rain for a week of rain, I really felt it. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5620.0s)]
*  And I remember calling my friend Steve. I have never been happier. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5626.0s)]
*  And that's why, is because it sucked for a week. And I think you need that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5629.0s)]
*  I think you need shitty people so that you appreciate good people. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5634.0s)]
*  And I think when you meet someone who's gaslighty and someone who tries to ruin your life, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5637.0s)]
*  those people exist so that you can appreciate people that aren't like that. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5642.0s)]
*  The yin and yang of life. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5647.0s)]
*  Another great example of that is when you have to pee so bad. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5650.0s)]
*  And then that moment when you get to the toilet. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5655.0s)]
*  Beer drinkers understand that. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5660.0s)]
*  Or when you're sick and then you're like, oh man, it's almost like you can't even remember how it felt to feel good. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5662.0s)]
*  And then when you feel good, you're like, wow, I'm so grateful that I feel good. It's an amazing feeling. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5669.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is the thing we take for granted more than anything is personal health. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5674.0s)]
*  And you give up personal health for short time, short term experiences like drinking. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5679.0s)]
*  Like drinking is terrible for your health. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5684.0s)]
*  But you give it up. You give up these little chunks of your health for these like small bursts of release of inhibition. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5687.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I never really liked it anyways. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5695.0s)]
*  It never really actually put me in. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5698.0s)]
*  Too often I always was like, I wish I hadn't. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5700.0s)]
*  It puts you in bad spots. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5707.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I think the people and I've read this that the people who actually sort of drink and become like happier with the life of the party or whatever are the ones who are more likely to become addicted, obviously. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5708.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5723.0s)]
*  You know, because there are there is like there are two types of people that when when they drink like for me when I drink, it kind of makes me think more. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5724.0s)]
*  And I get kind of depressed. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5731.0s)]
*  And I get like kind of down. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5732.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't really actually. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5734.0s)]
*  Well, you're a sensitive artist. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5735.0s)]
*  Literally. That's literally what you do. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5736.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5741.0s)]
*  You're right. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5743.0s)]
*  Now you can lean into that. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5744.0s)]
*  That's a weird thing, too. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5746.0s)]
*  People lean into that sensitivity. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5748.0s)]
*  They lean into it. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5750.0s)]
*  They carry it around as a badge of courage. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5751.0s)]
*  You know, it's just fine. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5752.0s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5754.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's those are the type of people that I mean, that's why I feel so good for them. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5755.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5761.0s)]
*  When you when, you know, you drink and then you just like become overly sensitive and think about things, it's just like it's because you have a lot of empathy and the alcohol, the release of inhibition makes you like be overwhelmed by the empathy. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5775.0s)]
*  Be overwhelmed by thinking. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5776.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, the world is filled with a lot of weird shit, man. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5777.0s)]
*  And it's like there's all these different channels that you can tune into all these different things that you can focus on. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5785.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, the ice bath analogy for me, it's like I love the clarity that I get after an ice bath. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5786.0s)]
*  And I feel like sobriety gives me that, you know, it's just like it's just like this great awake, alive feeling. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5796.0s)]
*  And I'm living in that clarity. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5803.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a perfect example. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5805.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you have to go through it to get there. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5807.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get out of that ice bath. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5809.0s)]
*  You feel so fucking good. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5810.0s)]
*  Why do you feel so fucking good? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5812.0s)]
*  Because for three minutes you felt like you're going to die. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5813.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5815.0s)]
*  That's literally the benefit of it. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5816.0s)]
*  And what's fascinating to me is I watch all these people try to dismiss it and all these people try to say, you know, it's foolish and silly. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5818.0s)]
*  And like the one thing those people all have in common, the dismissers, is they all lack discipline. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5825.0s)]
*  They all are fighting it intellectually. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5831.0s)]
*  They're fighting whatever that fucking mid-singulate cortex. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5834.0s)]
*  Anterior mid-singulate cortex. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5839.0s)]
*  Yeah, theirs is weak as fuck. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5841.0s)]
*  And they don't like it. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5843.0s)]
*  And so they try to diminish the people that do have it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5844.0s)]
*  You know, they try to diminish it, which is just a compensation thing that people do. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5847.0s)]
*  People are always doing that. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5852.0s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5853.0s)]
*  And, you know, those voices are important too, because those voices like you go, oh, I know why you're doing that. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5854.0s)]
*  Even the gaslighty people like, oh, I know why you're doing that. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5858.0s)]
*  Well, it's helped me get through life understanding people and that their behavior comes from their own trauma and their own past. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5861.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5871.0s)]
*  And the thing that you hate in other people, oftentimes you hate it because you're terrified of seeing it in yourself. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5872.0s)]
*  Well, that's the great lesson, you know. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5877.0s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that, here's what I think, it doesn't mean that you are that. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5880.0s)]
*  It just means that you're afraid of that inside. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5887.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5889.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean you are that. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5890.0s)]
*  But I think that, yes, it's like what you're most afraid of, you know. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5892.0s)]
*  Because you know it exists in you. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5898.0s)]
*  Because everything exists in all of us. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5899.0s)]
*  We're the exploded universe in manifested motion. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5901.0s)]
*  We are the unfolding universe every moment. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5908.0s)]
*  And when you get angry at foolishness that you see in other people, what you're angry at is that that thing could be in you. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5909.0s)]
*  And it is in you. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5918.0s)]
*  It's just you haven't fed it. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5919.0s)]
*  It's the wolf you haven't fed. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5921.0s)]
*  And discipline helps with that. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5922.0s)]
*  It helps you to understand that you are responsible for your feelings. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5923.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5928.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5929.0s)]
*  You're responsible for your feelings. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5930.0s)]
*  And also, like, there's things that you can do that can make life more bearable. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5931.0s)]
*  And one of those things is physical exertion. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5936.0s)]
*  It makes life more bearable. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5940.0s)]
*  And the way I realize this is when I don't exercise for like three or four days in a row, which is very rare. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5941.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5947.0s)]
*  And then when that does happen, I start getting really weird and anxious. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5948.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, people like this all day. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5950.0s)]
*  Like, some people like this their whole life where they're just riddled with anxiety and everything is a crisis. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5952.0s)]
*  Every little moat, every fucking moment is unbearable. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5959.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this makes sense. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5963.0s)]
*  This makes sense in our sedentary, weird world where people are just sitting and staring at a screen all day and, you know, and not doing things. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5965.0s)]
*  So you're not you don't have you don't have meaning. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5974.0s)]
*  Right. And then you're just overwhelmed. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5978.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then, you know, then you find a protest and go out there and start fucking screaming in the streets. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5980.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think there's more to that than that. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5986.0s)]
*  But yes, I agree. I mean, I think a lot of it is that, though, a lot of it is that a lot of what people protest, there's a lot of protests have real good purpose behind them. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5989.0s)]
*  But a lot of the people participating in those protests are looking for meaning in their life. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=5997.0s)]
*  They don't have it anywhere else. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6001.0s)]
*  Yes. Well, and you know, I mean, look, we need those people to we need those people to drive change. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6003.0s)]
*  You know, sure. If they're organic. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6009.0s)]
*  Yeah. Again, the problem with this world is that those things are manipulated just like that. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6011.0s)]
*  Yeah. You have to be weaponized. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6018.0s)]
*  You have to. It's important that you don't let your emotions be manipulated. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6020.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the great lessons in this wild world that we're in. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6025.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what I try the most. That's why I try not to make concrete statements, you know, unless I know at least, you know, where I err on is like, OK, this is this is the compassionate thing to support or do. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6029.0s)]
*  I have a charity that I work with called Music Heals International, and it's a music school in Haiti and Venezuela and India. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6043.0s)]
*  I think there's a presence here, too. And it's just I think I know that I can in concrete, create ways, make someone's life more joyful and on a face to face basis. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6054.0s)]
*  David Blaine was telling me about I met David Blaine one time and he was he's he's a cool guy. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6066.0s)]
*  Very cool guy. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6073.0s)]
*  And we were discussing that it's it's almost more powerful to be at a hospital and and and go and talk to the kids that you're supporting in this hospital rather than to donate to that hospital and sort of be. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6074.0s)]
*  I think there's just something so spiritually significant about being with the people that you're helping and the joy in that being reciprocated and that that feeling of being at the, you know, you know, just giving is is joy. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6089.0s)]
*  Ultimately, I think that's a really cool thing. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6105.0s)]
*  You know, like there's a great quote, A man slept and dreamt that life was joy. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6108.0s)]
*  He awoke and found that life was service. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6114.0s)]
*  He acted and behold, service was joy. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6117.0s)]
*  And I like that. I always remember that. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6122.0s)]
*  There's definitely something to that, right? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6124.0s)]
*  Making people feel good is selfish. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6126.0s)]
*  It is. And it's a joy. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6128.0s)]
*  And it's a win win. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6129.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a win win. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6130.0s)]
*  Like you get rewarded for being nice. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6134.0s)]
*  And I mean, there's also I don't like I think the word kind is more appropriate because people can be nice and not good. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6135.0s)]
*  But I don't think you can truly be kind. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6143.0s)]
*  And right. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6145.0s)]
*  Because if you're kind, you actually are thinking you feel it. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6146.0s)]
*  You feel it. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6150.0s)]
*  Where others you're just being polite. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6151.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6154.0s)]
*  And you can be you could say the right words with like a shitty feeling to it. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6155.0s)]
*  Like have a good day. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6158.0s)]
*  And you're like, you know, yeah, fuck you. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6161.0s)]
*  I know what's behind that. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6162.0s)]
*  British people are really good at that. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6164.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6165.0s)]
*  You know, they're really good at like saying the right words with like a cunty attitude behind it. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6171.0s)]
*  Because that's part of their culture. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6172.0s)]
*  It's like keeping up appearances. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6173.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, in a way, it's part of every culture. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6175.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6178.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, yeah, keeping up appearances. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6179.0s)]
*  It was one of the things I hated the most about Los Angeles. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6184.0s)]
*  It's like this the hollowness of communication. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6187.0s)]
*  That's my my bias against actors and people because I encountered so many people that were like artificial constructs. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6190.0s)]
*  Well, I loved it there when I went and I still love it when I go. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6199.0s)]
*  I mean, I've spent a lot of time. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6204.0s)]
*  Yeah, I lived there for 10 years. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6205.0s)]
*  Where'd you live? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6207.0s)]
*  In Venice. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6208.0s)]
*  OK. Well, that's a little different. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6209.0s)]
*  Venice is kind of at least it was before it was overwhelmed with homeless people. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6210.0s)]
*  Here's what I think about about Los Angeles is Los Angeles is like the cave in Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6215.0s)]
*  And when Lucas Yoda was in there and he says only what you take with you because you can go to L.A. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6222.0s)]
*  and find any type of energy, you can go to you can go to L.A. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6228.0s)]
*  and find any type of person. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6232.0s)]
*  There's groups of really amazing people and there's groups of people who are lost, you know, and there's different areas and there's different places that, you know, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6234.0s)]
*  where these different types of people congregate. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6243.0s)]
*  But but L.A. is a very powerful place. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6245.0s)]
*  It's a lot of moving play, you know, and I prefer to be in places that are less. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6248.0s)]
*  There's less movement. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6254.0s)]
*  I live in Maui. I have my friends in Maui. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6256.0s)]
*  My best buddy, Matt Meola, is a professional surfer and he's a bow hunter. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6259.0s)]
*  And my my friend, Ollie, works construction. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6264.0s)]
*  And, you know, when I go home to Maui, I like a simple life. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6268.0s)]
*  You know, I like, you know, my friend, they're all fishermen. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6271.0s)]
*  They're all, you know, I like to go out there and and that's how I want to raise my kids. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6274.0s)]
*  You know, I want to be out there in nature. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6279.0s)]
*  I want to be giving and taking with the land. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6282.0s)]
*  And I want to be able to understand the planet that I live on by working with the earth and working with, you know, and and that community in Maui there is a really special place. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6285.0s)]
*  Well, I think Hawaii in general is a very special place because it's surrounded by ocean. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6296.0s)]
*  And I think there's something about the ocean that gives you humility and it like lets you understand that you're a part of nature. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6301.0s)]
*  That's where we came from. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6307.0s)]
*  Yeah, we came from it. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6308.0s)]
*  And not only that, it's so huge and massive and overwhelming. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6309.0s)]
*  It's like the mountains. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6312.0s)]
*  Mountains have a similar effect. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6314.0s)]
*  It's like they're so vast. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6316.0s)]
*  You can't have much of an ego when you're in their presence. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6318.0s)]
*  My other favorite place is Montana. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6322.0s)]
*  There you go. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6325.0s)]
*  You know, other than, you know, yeah, I mean, I anywhere there's nature, but I really like I like that's being in the mountains of Montana and being on Hawaii. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6326.0s)]
*  There's only a few places in life that I actually am sad when I leave. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6336.0s)]
*  Like I get really upset. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6340.0s)]
*  You know, it's like breaking up with someone, you know, when you have to leave. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6345.0s)]
*  When you write, do you have a purpose in mind or do you just sit down and try to find out what comes to mind or do you have a thought in your head before you write? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6347.0s)]
*  Well, my best work comes. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6356.0s)]
*  It just it's like a conduit. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6358.0s)]
*  It like comes from another place. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6362.0s)]
*  And I hear I hear like like when I was 11, I wrote this song called You Were It. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6364.0s)]
*  And I was on the school bus and I started hearing this song in my head and I realized that it hadn't been written yet. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6372.0s)]
*  It was something that was coming from, I guess, my own experiences, but also filtered through somewhere else. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6379.0s)]
*  It felt like it came from somewhere and like it was a download, you know, and I think that I look at I look at writing as if like there's a beautiful muse sitting there. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6386.0s)]
*  And she's giving me these gifts every once in a while and then she sends them to me. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6400.0s)]
*  And if I'm open and clear and not in my own way and I'm, you know, if some if I get like something that hits me like a clever line, like there's a song I have called Find Yourself. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6404.0s)]
*  And I hope you find yourself before I find somebody else to be my love. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6415.0s)]
*  And I start singing that in my head and I start like, oh, the melody comes and it's a gift. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6419.0s)]
*  And wherever I'm at, if I was got one right now, I'd have to write it down while we were talking. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6425.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I have to sit down and hold on. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6430.0s)]
*  Let's write a song. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6433.0s)]
*  You know, and but I try not to, you know, I can't force her to send me because they're gifts, you know. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6434.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I it's like my dad always says, like, waiting for the rain to fill up the well. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6442.0s)]
*  You can't force the rain to come. You just have to wait. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6446.0s)]
*  And the real stuff comes when you just allow yourself to receive it. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6449.0s)]
*  And I think I like what you just said, too, getting out of your own way. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6453.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because that's the thing. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6456.0s)]
*  It's like these ideas are out there, but you're so in your own head and so worried about yourself [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6457.0s)]
*  and your own bullshit that sometimes like you you block them. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6463.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because all of your attention is on yourself. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6467.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, and you overthink it and you analyze it. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6470.0s)]
*  How am I going to look? Yeah. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6474.0s)]
*  And is it going to be cool? People going to like it? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6476.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the big one. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6479.0s)]
*  Is this like I think a lot of people get caught up in like, well, you know, like this latest record, you know, people like I didn't want to be too flowery with it. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6481.0s)]
*  I didn't I wanted to write simply what came to me. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6491.0s)]
*  And sometimes the songs are simple. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6494.0s)]
*  And I think that simplicity for some people can be like, oh, well, what about the the intricate arrangements [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6496.0s)]
*  and what about the long jams and the exploration? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6502.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's not what came to me. Right. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6505.0s)]
*  And I can't cater to those people. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6507.0s)]
*  You know, right now, where my heart is, is Zen. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6510.0s)]
*  It's I'm trying to be as simple as I can be in terms of just only putting out what comes to me at the moment. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6514.0s)]
*  And sometimes people aren't going to like it because they're used to me rocking and jamming and doing all that. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6521.0s)]
*  They're used to me doing that. But that'll come back. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6526.0s)]
*  It'll come back around. You know, there's there's a time and a place for everything. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6529.0s)]
*  And right now, I just I have to be I have to be open to it as it comes, not as I want it to be or as I think other people will want it to be. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6533.0s)]
*  You know, that's it. Right. You know, yeah. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6541.0s)]
*  You just have to whatever the thing has to be kind of pure in its form. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6543.0s)]
*  Yeah. And don't over molest it with a bunch of different production values and fucking layers. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6548.0s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Yeah. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6556.0s)]
*  And I prefer when I listen to my heroes, you know, Hank Williams, Dad, Merle Haggard, Stevie Ray and Jimmy are are. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6558.0s)]
*  Look, what came to Jimmy was an explosion of color and sound. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6569.0s)]
*  I mean, when I hear his music, I see colors that are like I can't even describe in real life. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6575.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6580.0s)]
*  Might have something to do with the psychedelics that I also took. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6581.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I think that other psychedelics he took and that's the thing is that he it goes back to what we're saying, like the state of mind that he was in one hundred percent. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6584.0s)]
*  He captured and he put it out. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6593.0s)]
*  Imagine writing Voodoo Child if you're sober. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6596.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, like, yeah, exactly. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6598.0s)]
*  And there's a time and a place for it. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6601.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, you know, and and but, you know, I have hundreds of songs I have not released that I wrote at different times in my life and I'll eventually put them all out, hopefully, if I'm lucky. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6603.0s)]
*  You know, you just go back to them and look at them every now and then. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6614.0s)]
*  Like, how do you how do you file them away? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6617.0s)]
*  Do you have money? I have it on a Dropbox file. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6619.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. Yeah. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6622.0s)]
*  So there's like a hundred songs in there. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6623.0s)]
*  More probably now because I write them all the time, you know, and and yeah, it's like it's just kind of. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6625.0s)]
*  It's just like sometimes it's like, God, I wrote another one. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6632.0s)]
*  It's going to go there. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6635.0s)]
*  And then that one shoots to the top of the list of the one you're interested in because you just wrote it. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6636.0s)]
*  And then something that might be really great just gets kind of pushed down. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6640.0s)]
*  And then like so what really you really have to do is each project that comes up, you have to say, what am I trying to what am I trying to get across right now? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6645.0s)]
*  And it's not about whether a song is better or worse. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6653.0s)]
*  It's about what what am I trying to say and how do I present that? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6656.0s)]
*  You know, and so I have to collect 10 or 12 or 14 songs from that that kind of fit in this in a narrative that you're trying to put out there. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6660.0s)]
*  And do you write a pen to paper or do you write on a computer? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6670.0s)]
*  Like, how do you do it for the most part? You're writing your phone. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6674.0s)]
*  I do for the most really. Yeah. Well, because I have fast thumbs. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6677.0s)]
*  OK. And my brain works really fast. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6681.0s)]
*  And when I get really excited, I'll write it down there. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6683.0s)]
*  I can read it properly. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6686.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'll write on a piece of paper. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6687.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6689.0s)]
*  I never talk it to your phone. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6690.0s)]
*  I put I use voice memo to record everything. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6692.0s)]
*  So a lot of the demos that I have are just voice memo to phone because my brain's working fast and this thing works pretty fast. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6697.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, voice memo has a transcription aspect to it too now. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6704.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even realize that. Yeah. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6708.0s)]
*  Yeah. I've been using that a lot. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6710.0s)]
*  So when you it works on both Android and on iPhones. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6712.0s)]
*  Yeah. But when you make a voice note, it can transcribe it now. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6716.0s)]
*  So like what I'll do is I'll record sets. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6721.0s)]
*  And sometimes we do we do this show at the comedy mothership called Bottom of the Barrel, where you have like a whiskey barrel inside is all suggestions from the audience. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6725.0s)]
*  Just put your hand in there and pick out a piece of paper and pull it out. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6733.0s)]
*  It's like tomato soup or whatever. Right. Right. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6736.0s)]
*  And you just have to start talking about it and try to find something in there. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6738.0s)]
*  And every now and then it's like, you know, one out of X amount of times you have a genuine idea that becomes a bit. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6740.0s)]
*  Sure. And the best way for me to fish those out is to go over the transcription. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6748.0s)]
*  So just totally to myself for an hour. Yeah. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6753.0s)]
*  I mean, that's great. I didn't realize that was a feature. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6756.0s)]
*  And I'm going to start using it. Yeah. It's pretty dope because you could just talk and it'll transcribe it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6759.0s)]
*  And then you can copy and paste that transcription into voice note or into notes. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6764.0s)]
*  And even notes itself has a voice memo aspect to it now. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6769.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. So if you go to just when you're in notes on an iPhone, like you can actually make a voice memo. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6773.0s)]
*  Right. Voice note from that and it'll transcribe that for you. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6780.0s)]
*  When you're doing a set, do you have people put their phones away? Yes. Yeah. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6783.0s)]
*  Yeah. The club does that. We have most comedians do that. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6788.0s)]
*  Right. Because they're trying a lot of material. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6792.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying material out. And also you don't want people distracted. It's better for everybody. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6794.0s)]
*  It's better for the audience. It's better for you. And also you're saying a lot of stuff that's like not done. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6799.0s)]
*  And if somebody releases it because they want clicks and then they put it on you, do the fuck the whole bit up because it's not done. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6805.0s)]
*  It's like in a lot of bits, they suck at first. Like you don't know where they're going. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6811.0s)]
*  Like you have an idea. And the only way comedy really gets made is in front of a crowd. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6815.0s)]
*  I have a lot of ideas that I think are really good until the audience tells me different. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6820.0s)]
*  You don't know. You really have no idea until you say it in front of people. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6824.0s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah. And it's very much the same for, you know, in music. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6828.0s)]
*  I feel like there's stuff that I try out live, you know, as a song. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6832.0s)]
*  I do a lot of new material live just to see how the audience will react. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6838.0s)]
*  Does it feel weird the first time you sing it? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6841.0s)]
*  It depends on what type of song it is, too. If it's a song that requires focus on the lyrics, you know, [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6844.0s)]
*  then sometimes it feels weird because a lot of people when they listen to music, they don't hear a lot of it. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6850.0s)]
*  Like it's hard. It takes a certain type of listener to listen to lyrics and be able to internalize them. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6857.0s)]
*  A lot of people take the song as a whole and the melody and they hear it and they're like, oh, this song makes me feel good. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6863.0s)]
*  And then later on, if they like the song, they'll go in and listen to the lyrics. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6869.0s)]
*  I've found a lot of people listen to music that way. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6872.0s)]
*  And then it takes them a while to actually hear what, you know, unless unless it's a stripped down me and a guitar with no band around. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6874.0s)]
*  And then it forces the listener to then listen to the words, you know, which I really like doing that. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6884.0s)]
*  Sometimes I like just playing just me because then it knows no distraction around. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6892.0s)]
*  And it's sort of just me, a guitar and the words that I'm saying. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6897.0s)]
*  And I think they have more impact sometimes that way. Yeah. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6901.0s)]
*  People love that, too. That's why they love acoustic performances. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6903.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Bob Dylan was an amazing Paul Simon. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6906.0s)]
*  Again, I like, you know, these are people that I I cite a lot, you know, in this in this way. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6910.0s)]
*  But, you know, Sierra Farrell, you know, Sierra Farrell. Oh, my gosh. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6916.0s)]
*  She's on my new record, Stephen Wilson, Jr. He's another great, amazing country singer songwriter. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6920.0s)]
*  Sierra Farrell has one of the greatest voices I've ever heard. Really? Oh, my God. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6926.0s)]
*  Yeah. You got your little love for music and and and Stephen Wilson, Jr. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6929.0s)]
*  Not only does he is a great writer, he used to be a food scientist. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6935.0s)]
*  So he was a he was a food scientist and he and he wrote songs kind of as a hobby on the side. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6938.0s)]
*  But he was responsible for like what percentage of what sort of goes into making dog food and like things like that is really interesting. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6948.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he now he's like really hitting it off. He's he's he's a great artist. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6957.0s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah. Like a food scientist to well, yeah, I guess there's probably an art to that, too, right? [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6962.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Create something delicious. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6968.0s)]
*  Well, you could be an evil food scientist creating junk food that's like super addictive. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6971.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of those out there. Oh, hell yeah. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6976.0s)]
*  But I don't know. You know, do they think they're evil? They probably just, you know, getting a job, you know, getting a job done. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6979.0s)]
*  They're just doing their job. What's their job? You know, I mean, a lot of these food companies, unfortunately, are now owned by the same people that used to own tobacco companies. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6983.0s)]
*  Right. Or still own tobacco companies. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6991.0s)]
*  And then they develop super addictive junk food. Family farms, man. Yeah. Farms, regenerative farms support your local family farmer. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=6995.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to eat junk food. No, you don't. But also you can. Yeah. Just don't eat it all the time. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7004.0s)]
*  Yeah. Twinkies are great. Yeah. They make you feel like shit. But while you're eating them, they're delicious. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7011.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like I think as far as junk food goes, I'm just a good old Snickers bar. Oh, yeah. Snickers bar. Great. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7016.0s)]
*  I don't even know if Snickers bar is like really junk food because there's a place for Snickers bars. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7024.0s)]
*  Like if you're in the backcountry, say if you're hiking Snickers bars has nuts, some some protein. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7029.0s)]
*  It's plenty of sugar in it, too, which you're going to need if you're burning off a shit ton of calories. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7037.0s)]
*  You're operating at a calorie deficit. And sometimes that's like exactly what you need. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7041.0s)]
*  You know, you need like a little bit of protein, a lot of sugar. And, you know, it helps fuel your muscles. Yeah. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7046.0s)]
*  And it gives you just simple simple simple calories. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7052.0s)]
*  Well, I think I just heard you were talking about this. Was it George Foreman? He's drink a Coke after each. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7055.0s)]
*  No, Floyd Mayweather. Yeah. He drank Coca-Cola after he worked out. Yeah. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7062.0s)]
*  There's something to that. There's something that as hard as he worked out, just like immediate sugar after exercise to replenish the body. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7066.0s)]
*  Yeah. My friend, Corey Sanhagen, was talking about that. OK. And he does that. Yeah. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7075.0s)]
*  You know, he's he's a big fan of like because he's an MMA fighter. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7080.0s)]
*  And so he'll do two and sometimes three workouts in a day. And, you know, like if you're going to do that, you have to do something after a hard workout to replenish the muscles in order to be able to work out and the carbs. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7084.0s)]
*  Then replenish the. Yeah, you need those sugars. Yeah. You need fruit. You need fructose. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7096.0s)]
*  But wouldn't you want it to be like a more pure like form of sugar than the like this? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7101.0s)]
*  And there are there different types of like refined sugar is not, you know, perhaps. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7108.0s)]
*  But also the like high sugar stuff gets in the muscles quicker. That's the argument for doing it like right after a workout. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7112.0s)]
*  Yeah. And is it when what is right after is it like within 15 minutes? I think it's within 30. I think that's the argument. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7121.0s)]
*  I mean, you have to like look at I mean, there's a lot of exercise scientists that I'm sure would have arguments one way or the other, which is interesting. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7127.0s)]
*  So they can't all agree. Right. You know, there's a lot of arguments. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7134.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it also depends on what kind of exercise you're doing. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7138.0s)]
*  You know, are you a weightlifter or are you a marathon runner? You know, because we had Courtney Doe Walter on the podcast once and she does ultra marathons. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7142.0s)]
*  And, you know, my friend Cam Haynes, who also does ultra marathons, says like she's like one of the toughest human beings he's ever met in his fucking life. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7151.0s)]
*  And she exists on sugar. She eats like candy and drinks beer. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7158.0s)]
*  It's like like it's not. Yeah. She's not like formed in a lab like whatever willpower that she has that allows her to, you know, she's beaten people. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7162.0s)]
*  What she does like these 250 mile runs where the second place person is like eight hours behind her. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7174.0s)]
*  Wow. Which is just bananas. Yeah. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7180.0s)]
*  That's the idea of like you could run 250 miles and then the second place. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7182.0s)]
*  It takes them eight hours longer than you to run those 250 miles. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7188.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's got to be genetic slightly to like the VO2 max is pretty high. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7193.0s)]
*  I don't know. Genetic. It's body type for sure. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7200.0s)]
*  You're not going to get like a six foot five 300 pound man that can do that. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7203.0s)]
*  Sure. Because your form physically can't really. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7207.0s)]
*  There's so much of a physical energy requirement to move that much mass in defiance of gravity over long periods of time. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7212.0s)]
*  Most of those people that are ultra marathon runners are very slight small people like Cam. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7220.0s)]
*  When he gets ready to do ultra marathons, he loses like quite a bit of weight. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7225.0s)]
*  You know, like at one point in time, he was like in the high one eighties and now he's down to like 160 and he'll get even lower than that. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7230.0s)]
*  How tall is he? He's my height. He's like five eight. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7238.0s)]
*  OK, five seven. So he'll get down to like 150 something when he's going to do like a 250 mile race. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7241.0s)]
*  But it's like that kind of mindset is a crazy mindset. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7250.0s)]
*  That's like a very unusual punishment that you're going to put yourself through voluntarily. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7255.0s)]
*  Yeah. When Chris died, Chris Christopherson died. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7260.0s)]
*  It hit me real hard. And I went and ran. I just kept running like Forrest Gump. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7264.0s)]
*  And I ran just thirteen point one miles. I stopped when I got half a mile, half a marathon. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7269.0s)]
*  And I was worked. I was like, oh, man, another thirteen point one miles for a marathon. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7276.0s)]
*  That's a lot. Well, you build up to it. Yeah, that's the whole thing. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7281.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you know, like if someone wants to work out tomorrow and they never worked it like I've done this with a lot of my comedian friends. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7285.0s)]
*  I take them to the gym. I go, look, we're not going to break you. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7292.0s)]
*  If you're going to work out with me, it's going to be very easy and you're going to maybe want to do more, but I'm not going to let you. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7295.0s)]
*  Like I'm going to make you do a certain amount of push ups, a certain amount of body weight squats. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7300.0s)]
*  We're going to do a few of these and a few of those. And then we're done. We're done. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7304.0s)]
*  And I don't want you to be tired. I want you to be just a little energized. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7307.0s)]
*  And then two days later, we'll do it again. And then we'll do it again and then we'll do it again and then we'll do it again. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7311.0s)]
*  And then after a while, your body gets stronger. Like now I'm going to require more of you. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7316.0s)]
*  Now we're going to actually exert. And now, OK, now you've got some muscle mass. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7319.0s)]
*  Now you've got some endurance. Now we're going to build on top of that. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7323.0s)]
*  The way I describe it, I'm like you're building a mountain one layer of paint at a time. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7326.0s)]
*  Well, you know, and the way to describe it, do you do the the scans, the body scans or Dexascan? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7330.0s)]
*  I have in the past. I haven't done one in a long time. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7338.0s)]
*  I just found this guy, Colin Anderson, 287 pounds, did a hundred mile. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7341.0s)]
*  Well, that's crazy. You like to break the world record. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7347.0s)]
*  It says ultra large. That's the name of the little documentary. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7352.0s)]
*  So he's 280 pounds and he ran an ultra marathon. Wow. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7355.0s)]
*  That must have been hell. That's incredible. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7361.0s)]
*  He lost at the end of the video there, too. Oh, my God. I bet he lost 50 pounds. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7364.0s)]
*  It just checks right here. How much weight did he lose? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7368.0s)]
*  I'll find out. Skip ahead. Spoiler alert. Spoiler alert. Get to the end. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7371.0s)]
*  Such weight gained weight. No, 297. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7376.0s)]
*  It says to what did he weigh before? It's 287 is what I was seeing. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7382.0s)]
*  Well, how's that possible? 10 pound weight gain after 100 pounds or 100 miles around. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7386.0s)]
*  What the fuck did you eat, bro? Wow. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7392.0s)]
*  I mean, he must have been eating the whole time, like right. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7396.0s)]
*  Like every few miles every five minutes. Yeah. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7400.0s)]
*  That's incredible, though. I guess. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7403.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Your body probably is doing everything it can to keep the water. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7406.0s)]
*  I mean, I can only guess. Yeah. That's pretty wild. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7409.0s)]
*  That is interesting. That's something I didn't expect to see. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7412.0s)]
*  Yeah. To be that big around 100 miles is very, very unusual. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7415.0s)]
*  Most of those guys are super slight and, you know, they just keep on trucking. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7418.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you read that book a long time ago? It came out. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7422.0s)]
*  I think it was called Born to Run, but it was like about the Tarahumara tribe. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7426.0s)]
*  They run barefoot. And I don't remember what it was actually called, but it was really interesting. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7430.0s)]
*  Yeah, they run through the mountains. It's like a South American tribe, right? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7439.0s)]
*  Yeah, South American or even Mexican. I can't remember. Is it Mexican? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7442.0s)]
*  I don't remember. But the Tarahumara is what they're called and they would run barefoot. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7445.0s)]
*  Wild. What the fuck? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7450.0s)]
*  And apparently, you know, they would also run, which was interesting, they would run happily. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7453.0s)]
*  They would have smiles on their faces and they'd be light. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7461.0s)]
*  And they said that that helped them sort of lightly grace themselves through the mindset that they had when they ran, helped them to outperform everyone else. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7464.0s)]
*  Well, they're probably doing it all the time. And in order to be able to run that much, again, you're building. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7473.0s)]
*  You're slowly but surely building on top of what you had before. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7479.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7483.0s)]
*  Like you can't. It's like if someone wants to just get out today and run a marathon, don't fucking do it. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7484.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7488.0s)]
*  You're going to blow your ankles apart. You're going to fuck your knees up. You're going to ruin your hips. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7489.0s)]
*  Like, don't do that. Don't do that. Run around the block. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7493.0s)]
*  And then the next day, maybe run twice around the block. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7495.0s)]
*  But you have to get better the same way you got sick. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7498.0s)]
*  Like you didn't get unhealthy, you know, in a day. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7501.0s)]
*  You got unhealthy over the course of a long stretch of life. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7505.0s)]
*  Do you run? Do you like to run? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7509.0s)]
*  No. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7510.0s)]
*  You don't run? [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7511.0s)]
*  No. I've done it. I have a knee issue. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7512.0s)]
*  So do you swim instead? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7515.0s)]
*  I swim. I do. But most of my cardiovascular exercise I do on an air dyne bike. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7517.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a big... [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7524.0s)]
*  Or I hit the bag. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7525.0s)]
*  But does the bike hurt your knee too? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7526.0s)]
*  No. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7528.0s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7529.0s)]
*  It's compounding. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7530.0s)]
*  Right. There's no impact. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7531.0s)]
*  I've had knee surgeries from years of martial arts. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7532.0s)]
*  I have like one knee that has meniscus missing. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7535.0s)]
*  And I can run. I do. But I just don't think it's the best thing. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7537.0s)]
*  You know, for someone who's got like... [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7542.0s)]
*  Then again, there's Goggins who has like fucking zero meniscus. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7544.0s)]
*  And he's basically bone on bone just running around. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7548.0s)]
*  But he gets a bunch of operations. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7551.0s)]
*  He's on like seven or eight operations to try to correct his knees that are fucked up from doing this. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7553.0s)]
*  They put plates in there and shit and he wears them out. Like it's nuts. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7558.0s)]
*  You know, I respect the guy. But that's a lot. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7561.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, he's ruining his body. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7565.0s)]
*  And he's hoping that science will get to a point where they could repair all that shit. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7568.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7572.0s)]
*  Without him having to get a knee replacement. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7573.0s)]
*  That's what it is. He's like placing it on that. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7574.0s)]
*  Well, it's like you can get a knee replacement now. Right? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7576.0s)]
*  And you'll be in significantly less pain. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7579.0s)]
*  But once science comes around, they're getting closer and closer every day [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7581.0s)]
*  to being able to completely regenerate cartilage, meniscus and all that tissue that you have inside your knee. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7586.0s)]
*  That keeps it healthy. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7593.0s)]
*  If you decide that you want to get a knee replacement, that kind of stops all that. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7594.0s)]
*  Because now you have an artificial knee. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7599.0s)]
*  And you can't regrow a knee once you've cut your knee out. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7601.0s)]
*  No, you can't. Yeah. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7604.0s)]
*  And so this is why he's not doing that yet. I think. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7605.0s)]
*  He's talked about it. He's like, maybe someday I'll have to. But right now it's just he'll just deal with it. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7608.0s)]
*  You look like you have to pee. Do you? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7613.0s)]
*  No. OK, I thought you did. You're weaseling around a little bit. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7615.0s)]
*  Because I always get sensitive to guests. Like if they start moving around a little. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7618.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, you got to pee? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7621.0s)]
*  Well, now let me take an assessment now. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7623.0s)]
*  Because we're like two hours in. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7625.0s)]
*  We are two hours in. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7626.0s)]
*  At least. Yeah. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7627.0s)]
*  I feel good, though. I don't have to pee. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7628.0s)]
*  I just sort of like, yeah, I guess I've just been sitting a while. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7630.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I do that too. I do that too. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7634.0s)]
*  Yeah, but for people out there that are thinking about like, oh, this is inspiring me. Start slow. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7636.0s)]
*  But do it again. Make sure you don't just get inspired one day. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7642.0s)]
*  Inspiration is great. Discipline is better. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7646.0s)]
*  You know what I did, which I loved, is that really helped me was like wherever I would walk, just in general, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7649.0s)]
*  I would just do a little like jog instead of walking somewhere. I'd just go like just a little something. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7659.0s)]
*  Just like this. Yeah. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7666.0s)]
*  It's kind of like almost like this. And I'd walk wherever I was going. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7668.0s)]
*  And I started to do that every day. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7672.0s)]
*  Just instead of like, oh, you know, instead of walking to get my coffee in the morning, I'd kind of do a little jog, you know. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7675.0s)]
*  And throughout the day, I'd do that. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7681.0s)]
*  And eventually I started like wanting to go out for a run. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7683.0s)]
*  Like my body just started warming up. Right. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7686.0s)]
*  And I kind of wanted to do that. Same concept. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7689.0s)]
*  Same concept. Build it up slowly. Yeah, exactly. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7691.0s)]
*  Just do something, people. I'm telling you. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7693.0s)]
*  Just go fucking do something. Find a yoga class. Do something. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7695.0s)]
*  Treat your body like a temple. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7698.0s)]
*  Well, just for your brain, you know, you got to understand that there's a connection. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7700.0s)]
*  If your body is sedentary, it's just sludge. It's all just blah. It's all blocked up. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7704.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. That fucks with your mind. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7709.0s)]
*  The mentally unhealthiest people that I know are all terribly out of shape. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7712.0s)]
*  Yep. And I mean, you know, there is a correlation for sure. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7718.0s)]
*  100 percent. You know, this is this life. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7722.0s)]
*  This life is you've given you've been given this meat vehicle and you got to maintain it. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7725.0s)]
*  It's a good band name. Meat vehicle probably already exists. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7731.0s)]
*  They probably have some banging songs. It's probably a hardcore band. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7734.0s)]
*  Definitely a hardcore band. Meat vehicle. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7738.0s)]
*  Wait, there are some other ones. Oh, biblically accurate angel. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7742.0s)]
*  Ooh, biblically accurate angel. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7746.0s)]
*  Have you seen what a biblically accurate angel? [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7749.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, they look like aliens. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7751.0s)]
*  That's pretty cool. Yeah, they look like geometric patterns. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7753.0s)]
*  Yeah. I always wonder what the alien, you know, Tucker Carlson's convinced that aliens and devils are. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7755.0s)]
*  That's that's what you like. Angels and devils and aliens are all the same thing. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7761.0s)]
*  He thinks that they're not visiting from somewhere else. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7769.0s)]
*  They've always been here and that there's some sort of spiritual aspect to like the UFO [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7772.0s)]
*  encounter, UAP phenomenon. Oh, I see. Yes. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7778.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of interesting pictures that are drawn on cave walls. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7783.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Things like that. Oh, we've gone over a shit ton of them. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7792.0s)]
*  And then also ancient religious art where it looks like people are in vehicles flying through the sky. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7794.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen those too. I've seen those too. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7799.0s)]
*  What is that? Like, what are you trying to? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7801.0s)]
*  There's no other stuff that you're in that thing that's fantastical. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7803.0s)]
*  Everything else is like an accurate representation of life at that time, except for these people that are in these flying things in the sky. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7807.0s)]
*  Like, what is that? Yeah. We just don't know. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7814.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, when I looked at all of the credible UFO reports, the only ones that really had no explanation. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7818.0s)]
*  I actually asked chat GPT of all of the credible UFO of all the UFO reports, which ones have not in some way been sort of explained. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7827.0s)]
*  Right. And which ones are the ones that are still like in the one that was not complete, the one that's still sort of outstanding is the USS Nimitz. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7839.0s)]
*  Yeah. Commander David Fravor. Right. Yeah. I've had him on the podcast. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7847.0s)]
*  Have you really? Yeah. Yeah. That seems to be the most compelling. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7851.0s)]
*  There's other ones though. Ryan Graves. He's another fighter pilot. And that was off the East Coast. So the Nimitz is off the coast of San Diego. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7855.0s)]
*  But off the East Coast, they upgraded their sensors in 2014 on the fighter jets and then immediately started encountering these things that defied known physics that were in the sky. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7865.0s)]
*  And, you know, and these guys had these encounters with these things that were like a cube inside of a sphere. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7876.0s)]
*  Sure. It's like motionless at 120 knot winds and no heat signature moving through the sky. They don't know what the fuck they are. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7883.0s)]
*  What what what do you say to the theory of the possibility that that is sort of black ops? [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7891.0s)]
*  Like the idea that the SR-71, I think Blackbird, the Blackbird, there's a there's a company called Skunk Works, right? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7899.0s)]
*  And they were they were responsible for the declassification of that aircraft. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7911.0s)]
*  And then I think the F-111 or the stealth bombers and you know, but since then, and that was like 25 years ago or more, there have not been any more declassifications. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7916.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good argument. I just I'm curious as to like what, you know, what in 25 years based on the technology that we've been able to see that makes it to modern society, how much is held back and what we don't see? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7928.0s)]
*  You know, it just interests me. And I don't know. I don't have an answer. You know, I'm not asking myself whether you know, I don't I actually believe that it's almost unlikely that we have that technology. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7947.0s)]
*  But because I feel like it would just take so much more than we may be capable of to cover it up, but maybe not. I don't know. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7959.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it would. I think there's a high likelihood that a lot of this stuff is ours. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7968.0s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons for that statement is that this stuff always happens over military airspace. Yeah, East Coast and West Coast. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7974.0s)]
*  So the East Coast stuff, the Ryan Graves stuff, they're doing it over areas where these fighter jet pilots run training missions. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7981.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then the same thing as the West Coast stuff, like that where it's off the coast of San Diego, which is like tons of military out there. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7987.0s)]
*  I do believe that there's some programs that are operational and there's a great podcast. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7993.0s)]
*  Jesse Michaels has an amazing YouTube channel that's he's he's covered this stuff like really extensively and he's a brilliant guy. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=7999.0s)]
*  He really understands it. And they were working on some anti gravity technology in the 1960s and most likely continue that work. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8006.0s)]
*  Yeah. Artificial Horizon technology and stuff like that, you know, that I mean, it's got to have come far since. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8013.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's the idea that they could hide all that stuff. No, they could never hide it. Of course they could. Of course they could. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8021.0s)]
*  They definitely could. You being naive, you being naive as to how much the government. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8026.0s)]
*  I'm only asking the question. I actually pretty much that's why I lean towards when it comes to that. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8031.0s)]
*  I think some of it, but some of it also could be from somewhere else. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8040.0s)]
*  And I think some of it just exhibits like the Nimitz one. OK, this is 2004. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8044.0s)]
*  So this tic tac goes from more than 50000 feet above sea level to sea level in less than a second. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8051.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like seven eighths of a second. Sure. Like that's crazy. That is. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8057.0s)]
*  And you're right. And what is that? And it does. It does. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8062.0s)]
*  It changes it when you remember how long ago these things were being seen. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8067.0s)]
*  Right. Because this is 2004. But then you go back to the 1960s. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8072.0s)]
*  If they're really working on anti gravity technology back then, it's possible that they could have created a drone. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8076.0s)]
*  Right. The thing is, like, could a human being survive inside of those things at those extreme speeds? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8082.0s)]
*  Well, the question is, like, what are they experiencing in that? [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8088.0s)]
*  Because if it's a gravity device, if it's moving, if it's manipulating gravity, so it might not have G forces at all. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8092.0s)]
*  It might be operating in a completely different paradigm. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8100.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there may be sort of just, you know, trillions of alternate sort of, you know, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8103.0s)]
*  momentum shifts in the outside protective layer that balance out whatever is happening on the inside. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8113.0s)]
*  Exactly. Where, you know, they're using this crazy technology. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8120.0s)]
*  That's also why the argument is that they're blurry. Like, so a lot of the photographs, these things are blurry. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8123.0s)]
*  It might be because they're actually existing in some sort of a gravity, like, void. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8128.0s)]
*  Yeah. And what you're seeing is not exactly what's there. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8132.0s)]
*  You're seeing it through like a dirty windshield. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8136.0s)]
*  I've seen some stuff. Have you? Yeah. What have you seen? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8139.0s)]
*  When I was in Maui, twice I've seen something that I could not explain. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8142.0s)]
*  The one time I looked up and about nine of us were hanging out. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8149.0s)]
*  And we all looked up at the same time to see an orange orb. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8154.0s)]
*  And it was probably, it looked like it was a hundred yards away, maybe 200, just floating, kind of observing. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8158.0s)]
*  And then I swear it seemed like as soon as enough people saw it, it went whoosh. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8165.0s)]
*  And then it went whoosh. And it moved like nothing else I thought possible at the time. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8173.0s)]
*  It went out of the atmosphere. And it was crazy, faster than any drone. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8179.0s)]
*  And this was back in like 2004, 2005 maybe. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8184.0s)]
*  So it was very, we were all young. I was maybe a little teenager, so it was probably like 2006. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8191.0s)]
*  But it was like, it was crazy. I'm not telling you. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8197.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of them happened near the ocean too, which is interesting. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8202.0s)]
*  And another one, I was out on Lanai and we were hanging out with some friends. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8206.0s)]
*  We were laying down on the lawn. And when you're out in Lanai, on the backside of Lanai, there's no light pollution at all. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8210.0s)]
*  And so you have just this big giant fishbowl of stars. And it's the most incredible. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8217.0s)]
*  It's like you're sitting in a spaceship. And you feel that you're on spaceship Earth at the time. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8222.0s)]
*  You know, like you are on that rock hurtling through space at that point. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8229.0s)]
*  And I saw this, we all, it scared the girls. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8233.0s)]
*  We all saw this pulsing colored thing go from one side of the horizon to the other. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8237.0s)]
*  But in a very, like it was like pulsing different colors. And it was like really interesting. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8244.0s)]
*  And so, you know, who knows what that could have been, but it was quite interesting. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8250.0s)]
*  Well, the vast majority of the ocean floor is unexplored. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8254.0s)]
*  And so this is the theory is that if you were going to set up a base here to observe human beings, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8258.0s)]
*  if you came from somewhere else, you would probably do it in the ocean, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8263.0s)]
*  especially if you have the kind of technology that allowed them to travel here from other star systems, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8267.0s)]
*  would also allow them to not be intimidated whatsoever by the pressures. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8272.0s)]
*  I mean, that's, I guess the deep pressure is what would be the, you know, [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8277.0s)]
*  it's almost the opposite of being in space, you know, the vacuum and then you have the deep pressure of, you know, that like, you know, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8283.0s)]
*  But there's videos of these things going in the water and not creating a splash. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8292.0s)]
*  So like, what is that? Is it a hologram? So is it not a physical object? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8298.0s)]
*  Or are they doing something that allows them to not interact with any physical thing on Earth, [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8302.0s)]
*  like some sort of a void that they travel through so they can go through the trees. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8308.0s)]
*  This is like part of Jacques Vallee's research to one of his books that was really fascinating was this woman observed this like egg shaped thing. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8314.0s)]
*  And when it took off, it went through the trees, but it didn't hurt the trees. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8322.0s)]
*  But it was on the ground, like as a physical object. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8327.0s)]
*  And when it took off, it went through the trees. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8331.0s)]
*  I wonder if then, you know, we're talking about like bending space time. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8334.0s)]
*  Yeah. At that point, are you creating some sort of like warp? [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8338.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're creating some sort of warp drive. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8346.0s)]
*  That's the idea. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8348.0s)]
*  You know, where you're just like warping space and time around a centralized location. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8349.0s)]
*  And so we sort of have to be, you know, use sort of the, you know, these like different sort of exotic forms of matter [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8355.0s)]
*  and having an understanding of exotic matter, which we're now just starting to understand that there are like, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8363.0s)]
*  are these exotic matter types that, you know, that work in these weird ways. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8369.0s)]
*  But as we, if you read about it now, the only information available is that we're only like cracking the surface of the understanding of these types of matter. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8374.0s)]
*  Maybe we are. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8383.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of years away from understanding that. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8384.0s)]
*  But I mean, you know, that's that old saying that any technology that's sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8387.0s)]
*  Is it Carl Sagan said that? I forget who said that. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8394.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8396.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, if you're looking at something from a thousand years from now, it would seem like magic. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8397.0s)]
*  If we continue, we don't pull ourselves up and science and A.I. continue to figure out more compelling uses of universal energy, [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8404.0s)]
*  like whatever background energy that we have. Yeah. Who knows? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8416.0s)]
*  Who knows what what human beings will be capable of? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8420.0s)]
*  So you got to imagine if something's visiting us from somewhere else, especially if they have artificial super intelligence. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8423.0s)]
*  If they've traversed this journey that we're on, they've gotten to the point where whatever we're currently investigate, [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8431.0s)]
*  whatever they're working on right now in terms of like super intelligent A.I., what if they've gone through that and they're a thousand years more advanced? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8441.0s)]
*  All that stuff would be probably simple for them to be able to go through the water, to have transmedium crafts that are capable of flying in the air through the water. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8448.0s)]
*  Right. Well, the interesting question for ourselves is how do we get to a place as a society to where we can trust in our science? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8457.0s)]
*  We can trust to say that we trust it enough to fund it. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8471.0s)]
*  You know, that's not trust in the science. The problem is the human beings that are in possession of the science. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8475.0s)]
*  Well, but that's what I mean. Like, how do we restore faith in that? [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8481.0s)]
*  And because there are there, you know, it's not all bullshit. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8484.0s)]
*  There is real, you know, like we wouldn't exist where we are without the science that has brought us to where we are. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8489.0s)]
*  Yeah. Technology and technology. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8496.0s)]
*  And so understanding and trusting and and and figuring out how to restore faith in certain institutions that we have because we need them to survive and to keep going. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8498.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like it's like not tearing down the airplane while it's falling. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8511.0s)]
*  You have to repair the airplane from inside, you know, and then keep it flying if you can. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8516.0s)]
*  You know, so is there a way to like right the ship while we're in it? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8521.0s)]
*  I think the problem is a lot of this stuff is military funding. Right. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8525.0s)]
*  So a lot of the applications for any sort of like super advanced technology is going to be weapon systems. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8530.0s)]
*  And that's what everybody's terrified of. What they're terrified of is that you're going to develop more efficient ways to kill people. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8536.0s)]
*  And that's really the only way these things get funded. You know, they're not going to know. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8543.0s)]
*  That's the problem. Yeah, I'm just saying I'm like, well, how do we how do we switch it so that we can, you know, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8548.0s)]
*  have people in power that really are looking out for the future of humanity and then have people that actually want that? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8554.0s)]
*  And because some people are going to have to take sacrifices for that, you know, in a way. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8562.0s)]
*  And I mean, people high up are going to have to say, well, I'm going to have to, you know, get paid a little less because this, you know, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8570.0s)]
*  It's a great struggle, Lucas. Yeah, it really is. Yeah, it really is. It's a great struggle. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8576.0s)]
*  It's the great struggle of like people in power, you know, don't necessarily deserve power. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8581.0s)]
*  And the kind of people that you want running the world aren't interested in the job. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8587.0s)]
*  Mostly. Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8592.0s)]
*  Well, hey, brother, I really enjoyed talking to you. Thank you very much for being here. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8597.0s)]
*  I appreciate you having me, Joe. And I encourage everybody to go see you live because you're fucking amazing. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8600.0s)]
*  It was really an incredible performance at the McConaughey thing. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8605.0s)]
*  And I wish you all the best, man. I wish you. It's been cool being your friend, too. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8609.0s)]
*  Enjoy talking to you. I enjoyed talking to you, too. All right. That was fun. Thank you. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8613.0s)]
*  Tell everybody where they could find you. Where's the best place to find your music? [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8616.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, on all the platforms, of course, we were there and we're going to we got a tour posted. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8620.0s)]
*  We're going to come. Yeah, that's live in concert. Oh, you're going everywhere. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8627.0s)]
*  You're like, yeah, I mean, we're about to put out new dates to for the fall. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8632.0s)]
*  We're going to be all over the East Coast, the West Coast. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8636.0s)]
*  We're going to be everywhere. But yeah, sorry, Kansas City. That shit sold out. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8640.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was a while ago. Yeah. Yeah. That was the one's coming up. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8644.0s)]
*  Charlottesville, Virginia, Allentown, Pennsylvania. Oh, yeah. Those are may. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8648.0s)]
*  Yeah. So there's plenty of stuff coming up. Yeah. Montana is going to be great. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8653.0s)]
*  Big Sky, Big Sky, Marks City, Utah. Yeah, there you go. Wyoming. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8657.0s)]
*  All right. Yeah, man. Thank you. Thank you. It's fun. Enjoyed it. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8661.0s)]
*  All right. Bye, everybody. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZC7ztBC-U&t=8665.0s)]
