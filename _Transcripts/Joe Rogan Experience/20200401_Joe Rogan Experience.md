# Joe Rogan Experience #1451 - Dr. Peter Hotez
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Q53KWZFMU)
*  Dr. Hotez, how are you sir?
*  Oh, it's great to see you again Joe.
*  I feel a lot better seeing you now.
*  I feel a lot better seeing you too, especially with the bow tie as we talked about before, your signature touch.
*  Yes, I was saying, when I started wearing a regular tie for a while it was like when Dylan started switching to electric instruments at the Newport Folk Festival.
*  There were just cries of outrage so I had to...
*  What kind of cries of outrage are you getting about your bow tie?
*  Especially in these trying times.
*  No, they liked the bow tie. The point was I tried to switch to a regular tie for a while and they said there's no way that can happen.
*  Yeah, that's what I meant. I screwed it up. Who's getting upset at you wearing a regular tie? Those people need to get a life.
*  I think it was meant in a good-natured way.
*  I'm sure. So we don't do very many of these Skype ones because they're odd. I don't know if you've done too many of these. Sometimes people talk over each other. It's very strange.
*  Yeah, I guess it's the epidemic, right? Otherwise I'd be on a plane and come to see you in LA.
*  Yeah, we'll do that again sometime. So let's get going. So taking it from the top, let's discuss...
*  Give us your take on how we got here because it's been very strange.
*  Very strange. Obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen and the way he was explaining it to the news.
*  He was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone. And now obviously New York City is shut down. The entire country is separated from each other. Everybody is isolating at home.
*  Give us your take on how we got here.
*  Well, you know, the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it. We had a heads up and even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century.
*  We had what's called SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2003. That started in China and caused a terrible epidemic in Toronto.
*  It actually took the Rolling Stones to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003. And then it was Mayer's coronavirus infection in 2012 and this is the third one.
*  So we actually realized that coronaviruses were going to become a new thing and we embarked on a big coronavirus vaccine program a decade ago.
*  And each time they've caused devastating hospital epidemics, they've affected health care workers.
*  So the point is this unfortunately has become a new normal for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics.
*  And we saw this one coming up at the end of 2019 in China. And I knew we were in for trouble because that's what coronaviruses do.
*  So you knew that we were going to be in trouble because there was no way they can contain it and keep it in China?
*  Well, the difference with this one compared to the other two was this. The other two, SARS and Mayer's, now we call this new one SARS-2.
*  So there was SARS-1, then Mayer's, then SARS-2. So both SARS-1 and Mayer's made you so sick and at such a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community.
*  The difference with this one, ironically, is it's pretty lethal. It's about five to ten times more lethal than regular flu, seasonal flu.
*  But also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all.
*  And so you have this sort of perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen.
*  It's not the most transmissible infection we've ever seen, but it's high enough in both categories that it combines in this very toxic way.
*  So what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the intensive care unit, like older people, those with diabetes and hypertension, even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick.
*  And then a larger group who are only getting mildly sick who can still walk around the community and be out and about in stores and restaurants and infecting everybody.
*  And so this is what's caused the problem. It's highly transmissible.
*  And there's a big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset, but a big subset, who are getting very sick and even dying in intensive care units.
*  So that's what's playing out in New York City right now, for instance.
*  Do we know why so many people are asymptomatic?
*  We don't. We really don't.
*  There's a rough correlation with age.
*  So younger people seem to do better and actually kids seem to do really well with this infection.
*  They don't get with one exception that I'll tell you about in a minute.
*  Most kids don't get very sick at all, but they're helping with the community spread.
*  And we don't quite know why. Also, but something that's very important and one of the reasons why I really wanted to come on and talk to you about COVID is there's this buzz out there in the community that it's only old people that are getting sick and dying and going to ICUs.
*  But in fact, the Centers for Disease Control came out with this very chilling document a few weeks ago showing that about a third of the very sick people in the hospital are under the age of 40 or 44.
*  So between 20 and 44, young adults are getting very sick.
*  And that word has not gotten out adequately because when this infection first appeared in central China, it was all about older individuals over the age of 70, those with diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
*  We didn't hear about the young adults, but then for reasons that we don't understand, we saw this big group in Italy and France, Spain of younger adults and we're seeing that play out in the US.
*  And I know the people who listen to you and watch you, it's a big group between that age of 20 and 44.
*  And they really need to hear that they're at risk for severe illness, despite what they might have heard previously.
*  Well, we have a friend, Michael Yo, who was actually on a podcast with me the week before he went to New York.
*  He was there that weekend, actually, and that's when he got it.
*  So he got COVID-19 in Manhattan and then flew back, got sick.
*  And here's what's really maybe you could help me with this.
*  He said he was feeling terrible and then took Advil and it got exponentially worse.
*  Is that coincidental, do you think?
*  I mean, there's been talks of avoiding ibuprofen.
*  Michael's 45 years old, very healthy, very robust guy.
*  So when he was, I mean, he was in the hospital for a week and his words were, I almost died.
*  I mean, he was really, really concerned.
*  What about what about ibuprofen?
*  So there's been a lot of buzz on the Internet about ibuprofen.
*  And then the World Health Organization came out with a specific statement saying those are rumors.
*  So there's not a lot of evidence to say that you get worse with ibuprofen.
*  Probably he was just one of those young adults that's going to get very sick.
*  And that's what this virus does.
*  It has the ability to get deep into the pulmonary system in your lungs, binds to receptors on the cells of your lungs.
*  And causes a terrible pneumonia.
*  And on top of it, you get a big inflammatory response.
*  So it really can, it's a severe pneumonia, can even prevent your ability to breathe.
*  And that's why so many people who are getting really sick with this virus have to go on respirators.
*  That's exactly what happened to Michael. He got pneumonia.
*  So there's is that there's a rumor that you shouldn't take ibuprofen.
*  But is that unfounded?
*  Are you advising people to take ibuprofen?
*  Do you think they should just avoid it just in case?
*  And where did this rumor start from?
*  And what is the concern with ibuprofen?
*  And then you've got the problem.
*  You know, some people also say don't take aspirin because if this is a respiratory virus infection,
*  there could be a severe reaction with aspirin as well.
*  So for now, you know, and I said the other thing, Joe, is anything we say today,
*  I might look like the biggest idiot in the world tomorrow or next week.
*  And that's because this is a brand new virus and we've never seen before. Right.
*  So we're on a steep learning curve.
*  So we're learning new things about this virus every day.
*  So that's why, you know, so many things I'm going to say today, if I sound like I'm waffling or hedging, it's because I am.
*  We're learning so much that's new about this virus.
*  So it's really important that everybody be really mindful and pay attention to real health information that from accurate sources,
*  because things move, things change as we learn more about this.
*  This is a virus that we didn't even know existed about four months ago.
*  And we've learned about it in an incredible period of time.
*  The Chinese put up a lot of information on these preprint servers about what the virus is, what the sequence is,
*  the genetic code, what the receptor binds to.
*  When we had the original SARS, we call this new one SARS 2, the COVID-19.
*  So the disease is called COVID-19.
*  The virus is called SARS 2, SARS-CoV-2.
*  When we had the original SARS 1, it took us over a year to learn all that information.
*  Now everything's been compressed in a few weeks.
*  So it's really extraordinary.
*  But there's still so much so much we're learning right now.
*  I'm so glad you brought that up because that is really important for people to understand,
*  people that maybe haven't looked into the complications that are involved in trying to recognize treatments and cures for a virus,
*  that it is, it's, everyone's learning.
*  Yeah. And also, you know, and everything we have known so far about the virus is what happened in China.
*  And it turns out the Chinese have some genetic differences to Europeans and Americans.
*  And things can change depending on, it's not just the pathogen, it's also what we call the host, the person too.
*  So the fact, you know, that the virus affected young adults in Europe and the U.S.
*  in a way that did not necessarily occur in China is important.
*  And so we are, we're keeping, and then who knows what happens when this virus goes into Latin America or India or Sub-Saharan Africa.
*  And it's not because the virus is mutating necessarily.
*  It's just that there's also the host component as well, which is quite important.
*  Well, that's one of the issues that people are having in terms of blood type.
*  There's all this talk of certain blood types may be more susceptible to the virus, particularly blood type A.
*  Yeah. Well, actually, this is actually well known in the infectious disease literature.
*  There, I mean, there's a whole, I put one up on Twitter, I think a week or so ago.
*  There's dozens of different pathogens, including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending on a person's blood type.
*  So host genetics influences things quite a bit.
*  Now, let's talk about Germany, because I found that really fascinating when I was reading on Germany and their low mortality rate.
*  What do you attribute that to?
*  Is that the extraordinary health care they have there?
*  Or what is that?
*  Well, let me give you first the opposite side of the coin.
*  And then we'll talk about Germany.
*  The opposite side of the coin, what's happening in Italy and Spain, 10 percent mortality.
*  So 10 percent of the people who are who are being diagnosed with COVID-19 have died, which is higher than just about anywhere else.
*  I think what's happened there is when the health system gets so overwhelmed that so many.
*  So in other words, if transmission goes on for a long time and you haven't picked it up and then all of a sudden people start showing up in the ICU, then it's too late.
*  Then you start having massive numbers of people come into the ICU.
*  The hospital can't take care of everybody.
*  They can't intubate everyone.
*  They can't give everyone the highest quality care possible.
*  It's no fault of the doctors and nurses.
*  They're heroes.
*  But the fact that they're completely overwhelmed with patients, that's when mortality starts to to really rise.
*  So we saw this in parts of Wuhan and we saw this in Italy.
*  And that was the big worry about New York that the same thing would happen to New York.
*  But I'll hold that thought for a second.
*  In Germany, so far, we think it's a combination of that.
*  It's been more younger people getting it.
*  And the fact that the hospital system was getting ready and they've got that infrastructure in place to manage that surge, although they're worried now, too, that it may start going up and overwhelming things.
*  And then you look at, OK, so if that's true, what's the story on the mortality rate in the United States?
*  And interestingly, so far, one of the highest has been New Orleans.
*  And I think what happened there was they kept the Mardi Gras open.
*  They had lots of mixing and people, large numbers of people getting infected.
*  Number one, it overwhelmed the health system, just like in Italy.
*  So there is so in New Orleans right now, the case fatality rate is between four and five.
*  But there's another factor going on in New Orleans.
*  Lots of people living in extreme poverty and poverty is very linked to diabetes and hypertension.
*  And we know diabetes and hypertension is a big risk factor for death.
*  So New Orleans is getting hit twice, one because the health system is getting overwhelmed.
*  And second, I think you have a lot of African-Americans living in poverty with underlying diabetes and hypertension.
*  And that's causing that to skyrocket.
*  So, you know, I was just on the phone today with the leadership of Houston and saying, you know, you know, we have a similar demographic to New Orleans in many ways.
*  We're sister cities after Katrina kind of linked at the hip.
*  And, you know, there are sister cities.
*  We love them.
*  But, you know, we have to recognize that even though if we can handle the surge with our Texas Medical Center,
*  we still have that demographic of African-Americans, Hispanics with underlying diabetes and hypertension.
*  I'm really worried we're going to see high mortality in Texas.
*  Now, is another factor with Italy and their high mortality rate smoking?
*  Because when I was in Italy, I was stunned by how many people smoke, young people, old people.
*  It seemed like a large percentage of the population smoked.
*  Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up.
*  I should have remembered to say that.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, for instance, Chinese, older Chinese men had really high mortality rates.
*  And here's something very interesting.
*  Smoking actually upregulates the receptor in the lungs that the virus binds to.
*  So it seems to make more copies of the receptor for the virus to bind to.
*  So that may worsen the disease.
*  So I think you're right.
*  I think smoking is a factor.
*  The one question that we don't know is what does vaping do?
*  Is vaping also doing that?
*  And could that be linked somehow to the young and all the young adults that we're seeing in the United States who are getting hospitalized?
*  They actually don't have higher mortality, but they're still getting very sick.
*  And their lives are being saved because they're being intubated and put on the vent.
*  But is there a vaping connection?
*  Again, new question.
*  We don't know.
*  It's something that's going to have to be looked at.
*  Boy, there's going to be a lot to unravel when all this is over.
*  And along the way, people are dealing with a lot of misinformation, which is one of the reasons, one of many reasons why I'm so thankful for you for coming on the podcast and trying to educate us on this thing.
*  What about?
*  That's the reason I'm going up.
*  Been going on in between where, you know, we I co-lead a team with my 20 year science partner, Dr.
*  Mary Elena Potazi.
*  We're trying to we've we develop vaccines, including coronavirus vaccines.
*  We're trying to get those out the door in clinical trials in between.
*  I'm going on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.
*  And that's not an easy needle to thread either going on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.
*  That's been really interesting, but I love the opportunity and and I'm doing it because there's a lot of bullshit out.
*  There's a lot of misinformation trying to get accurate information and also explaining the science behind it, because sometimes you hear something that doesn't sound right.
*  And it sometimes takes a couple of minutes to explain that.
*  And those three cable news networks have been great about giving me some time to to explain the thinking behind it, which they ordinarily wouldn't do.
*  That's great.
*  Now, let's talk about treatments that are being considered.
*  We know that Z packs are one of them and chloroquine.
*  Can you explain that and what went horribly wrong with the couple that took the wrong kind of chloroquine and turned out to be a koi pond cleaner?
*  OK, so let me let me give you the framework for that.
*  So it makes some sense when we talk about all the interventions, you have things that are going to be ready down the line.
*  Things are going to be ready a little closer and things ready now.
*  So and then and then we can talk about one on one and then I'll I'll we could let me give you the framework that I'll answer your chloroquine question.
*  So the highest bar there is in terms of financial investment required in time to show safety is a vaccine.
*  So that's what that's what we're doing and other groups are doing next tier down.
*  That's going to be a year, 18 months away, according to Dr.
*  Fauci, could be longer than that.
*  Next tier down are what we call small molecule drugs, new drugs that have never been discovered before.
*  It still takes a while, maybe not as high a bar as vaccine in terms of time.
*  The next tier down is repurposing existing medicines that we already know are relatively safe and then showing that those drugs also work against the coronavirus.
*  And that's going to be the chloroquine category.
*  And I'll get to your question.
*  And then the nearest ones, the one that we could do now is what's called this convalescent antibody therapy, which I've been pushing very hard on because I think we can actually have it going that right now.
*  So let's do the let's do the chloroquine hydroxy chloroquine.
*  This is and that's one of the repurposed ones.
*  That's not the lowest hanging fruit, but the next lowest hanging fruit.
*  This is a medicine that's used for malaria.
*  It's an anti-malarial drug.
*  It's been around for decades.
*  In fact, the World Health Organization was going to had in the 1960s proposed an elimination strategy for malaria to treat everybody with chloroquine until we had chloroquine resistance.
*  And that derailed that.
*  But in some parts of the world still works as an anti-malarial drug.
*  It's also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune diseases.
*  You can make a bucket of it.
*  It's cheap.
*  We know the safety profile.
*  We know it can cause arrhythmias in some patients and other toxicities, but it generally has a pretty good safety profile.
*  We know that this drug can block the replication of the virus in the test tube.
*  So it inhibits the virus in what we call in vitro in the test tube.
*  Second, we know this drug reduces inflammation.
*  And that's nice because one of the things you get with COVID-19 pneumonia is that it's a very high risk of infection.
*  Because one of the things you get with COVID-19 pneumonia is you not only get the virus infection in the lung, you got a lot of inflammation.
*  So it checks a couple of boxes in terms of why it's attractive to look at it.
*  And then the Chinese did a small study.
*  And then a colleague of mine is a fascinating guy.
*  I really appreciate his work as a scientist.
*  He's a very serious scientist in Marseille in France named Didier Raoult.
*  And he must have published at least two or three dozen papers in the journal that I founded called PLOS, Neglected Tropical Diseases.
*  He's a serious scientist, works on all sorts of intracellular bacteria and that kind of thing.
*  Tick-borne diseases did a small study showing that it worked in COVID patients.
*  And what he did was he combined hydroxychloroquine with this Z-Pak, the azithromycin drug, and found that there's an effect.
*  The problem was it was a very tiny study.
*  And so people put those three things together and all of a sudden said, we've got the miracle cure.
*  I'm not sure that's going to turn out to be the case.
*  I mean, we really need to do large studies to show that it really works.
*  And the reason I'm holding back is nothing to do with Dr. Professor Raoult, who's a really important scientist, but it's a small study.
*  We were there about a decade ago with influenza, that this hydroxychloroquine also inhibited the influenza virus in the test tube.
*  But then it didn't pan out in larger clinical studies.
*  So I think we have to be really careful and don't be too quick to say, OK, this is going to be it.
*  We're not even close to that yet.
*  But we'll know in the next few weeks because we're working hard to scale up clinical trials looking at that medicine.
*  Now, in terms of vaccines, but there is a there is a there is a new there's something new, though, that we can do right now.
*  OK, talk to you about.
*  So this is something called convalescent antibody therapy.
*  And it was and it was known it's been known for over 100 years.
*  And it was really scaled up during the 1918 influenza pandemic, you know, that terrible pandemic that killed 100 tens of millions of people.
*  It was shown that if you took individuals who had recovered from the disease, who had gotten infected, they survived, they had antibodies in their blood.
*  You could remove their blood, in some cases, give them back their red cells and take the plasma component and use that as a therapy to treat patients.
*  And and in fact, during the 2003 SARS epidemic, the first SARS, SARS one, there's been a number of studies showing that it worked.
*  It actually you could treat patients for it, especially if you gave it early on in the course of the infection.
*  If you waited too long, then it didn't have nearly the same benefit.
*  But you gave it early on the course of infection.
*  It could prevent more serious infection and even death because you're actually giving back antibodies.
*  The antibodies won't last forever, but enough to help you survive the infection.
*  So a good friend and colleague who I've known for a long time, Arturo Casadoval, who's a brilliant professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins, you know, started talking to me about, you know, Peter, maybe we should be doing this for covid-19.
*  And and as the numbers started going up, I said I called him.
*  I said, look, Arturo, I'm going on CNN tomorrow.
*  I think this is an opportunity to tell people about this.
*  So I, you know, helped amplify what he was doing.
*  He had written a paper with a colleague from Johns Hopkins, Lisa Perot.
*  Perot always get her always mangle her name.
*  And I talked to him about this and that really got things moving along.
*  So I've been trying to use my voice on, you know, being on CNN or Fox News and it's not not just to hear myself talk, but to actually raise specific issues to get people to care about about certain things.
*  And I and I used it for this purpose.
*  And I think it helped to mobilize some action.
*  And now what Arturo and his colleagues are doing together with the FDA.
*  So there's a branch of the Food and Drug Administration that's been working on this.
*  Which is this amazing, you know, you hear a lot of bad things about the FDA.
*  I think the FDA is amazing myself.
*  But CBER is something very special.
*  All these brilliant scientists who deal with vaccines and biologic, they're on board with it.
*  I've been talking with Peter Marks, Dr. Peter Marks, who's the head of CBER.
*  And he's teamed up with Arturo to get this network together going at least among 20 of the world's leading scientists.
*  So that they're identifying patients who recovered, taking their blood, giving them back the red cells, collecting the plasma so that when people come in sick, they can give treatment and they'll have some clinical trial results.
*  I hope in the next few weeks.
*  But I'm really optimistic about that one for for saving lives.
*  The other thing Arturo's talked to me about is, you know, could you use it in small scale?
*  And I think that's a great idea.
*  And that's why they turned the Empire State Building into a siren last night and to honor all of the all of the first responders who have gotten sick.
*  We knew this was going to happen.
*  Maybe this this could help them.
*  But I think that's a great idea.
*  And I think that's a great idea.
*  And I think that's a great idea.
*  And I think that's a great idea.

*  And I think that's a great idea.
*  We don't have a lot of track record doing this.
*  We did it once with Ebola.
*  We did it once with Ebola.
*  If you remember in 2014, there was a terrible Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
*  If you remember in 2014, there was a terrible Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
*  It affected 33,000 people.
*  11,000 people died.
*  That was in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone.
*  That was in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone.
*  And there were some initial vaccine trials started by Merck and Company.
*  And there were some initial vaccine trials started by Merck and Company.
*  That looked pretty promising.
*  They had licensed the technology from the Canadians,
*  this group in Manitoba,
*  a public health Canada.
*  And it looked promising.
*  But as the trials got underway,
*  what happened was there was an international response
*  to put in a health system.
*  Because it turns out Ebola is not very transmissible.
*  Because it turns out Ebola is not very transmissible.
*  You just have to have some healthcare infrastructure,
*  make certain that you're not directly handling
*  the corpse of someone who's recently
*  died from Ebola virus infection.
*  the corpse of someone who's recently died from Ebola virus infection.
*  And we even sent in the 101st Airborne Division.
*  And we even sent in the 101st Airborne Division.
*  And we sent in the Screaming Eagles,
*  which made a big impact on helping to
*  which made a big impact on helping to
*  save West Africa from this infection.
*  So the WHO came in.
*  There was UNICEF.
*  There was Doctors Without Borders.
*  The Israeli Army came in.
*  The Israeli Defense Force came in.
*  A lot of groups came in to help West Africa.
*  A lot of groups came in to help West Africa.
*  And so the vaccine never really got fully tested.
*  And so the vaccine never really got fully tested.
*  But then five years later,
*  there was the terrible epidemic in
*  Democratic Republic of Congo.
*  That's when the vaccine really came into
*  widespread use. And it's
*  probably one of the most important public health stories
*  never told, which was
*  under conditions of terrible
*  conflict and war and political
*  strife and
*  civil war.
*  They vaccinated 200,000
*  people with this vaccine.
*  And it largely helped
*  eliminate Ebola
*  from Democratic Republic of Congo
*  during those hostilities
*  last year.
*  And essentially saved
*  I think it helped to stabilize
*  the whole African continent.
*  So it's an amazing
*  story. And again, it was this multilateral
*  effort that involved also
*  the US government, the NIH,
*  and BARDA, and all
*  of these organizations. It's an extraordinary
*  story. And as a result,
*  we really helped stabilize
*  sub-Saharan Africa. But
*  look at the time frame. 2014,
*  first epidemic to 2019,
*  that's five
*  years. That's a more realistic
*  time frame for a vaccine
*  just to give people a sense of
*  perspective. Peter, one of the things
*  that I was reading about Wuhan
*  is that there was an NPR article
*  recently that was talking about people
*  testing positive after they had
*  tested negative, where they had tested
*  negative and then a time period
*  had gone by and then they had tested positive
*  again. Are we learning,
*  obviously we're learning about
*  this as a new virus, but is it
*  possible that this is something you
*  can re-catch in a short period of time,
*  like within a few months? Or do you think
*  that these people had
*  false negatives? We don't
*  know. I think there's a high likelihood
*  that they're not getting reinfected
*  once they develop antibodies.
*  But we don't know for sure.
*  The problem with respiratory virus testing
*  is this.
*  And it turns out, even before
*  those three big pandemic
*  coronavirus I was talking to you about,
*  we've known about coronaviruses
*  for even longer than that because kids
*  get a lot of upper respiratory infections
*  with these other type of coronaviruses
*  that rarely cause
*  serious illness deep in the lungs.
*  And the testing for those
*  viruses is a mess because
*  number one, you're often not
*  actually culturing the virus.
*  You're doing what's called PCR to look for
*  the genome of the virus. And you don't
*  know if the virus is really there.
*  It's just bits and fragments of
*  destroyed virus that are testing
*  positive for PCR.
*  And we have all these odd results like
*  kids with no symptoms
*  at all are testing positive
*  and then kids with symptoms
*  are testing positive and negative. And it
*  turns out diagnosing respiratory
*  virus pathogens is not
*  easy. It takes a lot of time to
*  do the quality control
*  and really figure out all the testing. And the
*  Gates Foundation has a
*  very significant
*  respiratory virus pathogens program
*  which has been looking into this
*  for a few years now. Not necessarily for coronavirus
*  but for other respiratory viruses.
*  It's very, and there are other respiratory
*  pathogens. It's not as straightforward
*  to diagnose
*  respiratory infections
*  as it is
*  say for things that are in the blood.
*  Because a lot of these respiratory viruses
*  never get actually blood born. So you're
*  sampling
*  mucus from the nose or
*  your washings from the mouth
*  or the throat. There's probably inconsistency
*  in the sampling. So it's
*  really problematic. And I think
*  that may have been partly responsible
*  for some
*  of the delays. The CDC
*  kind of work it out and get it
*  perfect and it just took longer than
*  perhaps they expected. Peter
*  Is the possible
*  silver lining to this cloud that this
*  is a wake up call for people to really
*  take serious the funding
*  of vaccines, the funding
*  for pandemic research
*  to make sure that we
*  never let something like this ever happen again?
*  Well, of course we
*  always say that. But then again we said this after
*  SARS in 2003.
*  We said it after H1N1
*  in 2009. We said it
*  after MERS in 2012.
*  Nothing's ever shut down the country like this.
*  But the point is after
*  every pandemic everyone says, oh
*  now we're going to put some infrastructure in
*  place. And the truth is
*  things are better now than they were.
*  So after SARS
*  in 2003, they implemented
*  this set of international health
*  regulations, IHR
*  2005. And a lot of that was
*  led by a friend and colleague of mine,
*  David Heyman, who's now at the London
*  School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
*  and with Chatham House
*  in London. And he was, I think
*  he was Assistant Director General of the
*  WHO then. And they put that in
*  place and a global health security agenda
*  and now we have this thing called CEPI,
*  this Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
*  Innovation. So there's no question things
*  are a little better,
*  substantially better than they were, but
*  it's still not enough. It's still, we don't
*  have the infrastructure
*  in place. We need to
*  rapidly accelerate
*  vaccines because a lot of the times,
*  and I get involved in this because
*  I've been devoted my whole life
*  to developing vaccines for diseases
*  nobody else will make vaccines
*  for because there's no financial return.
*  We've been doing this for parasitic
*  disease vaccines and
*  that's what we spoke about last time.
*  But also we've had this Coronavirus
*  vaccine program. And the problem is
*  the big industry partners,
*  the multinationals, sometimes they
*  get involved in this, sometimes they don't.
*  This leaves it to
*  smaller biotechs,
*  which are mainly focused on accelerating
*  their unique technologies
*  or this handful of nonprofits
*  like ours at Texas Children's
*  and Baylor College of Medicine. We call
*  our Texas Children's Center for Vaccine
*  Development at Baylor
*  College of Medicine.
*  And it's a fragmented infrastructure
*  and we're always
*  scrambling for funds. I mean even now
*  when we've got two vaccines we're ready
*  to move on. I'm still
*  spending I don't know how many hours a day
*  on teleconferences
*  with potential donors trying
*  to get this out at clinical
*  trials. So it's
*  definitely problematic.
*  But Peter, I think we both agree this is a
*  very different situation than SARS or
*  MERS or any of those other things in that the entire
*  US economy is totally
*  shut down. I mean if
*  anything is going to be a wake up call for industry,
*  if anything is going to be a wake up call for people
*  with money, this is going to be it because this
*  is devastating for everybody.
*  You would think so. And I'm
*  hopeful that things will change but we'll
*  have to see. I mean so far we've had
*  some good responses in terms of our
*  vaccine. We've gotten
*  contacts from a few individual
*  donors. So we're in those
*  discussions but it's still been really tough
*  to move it forward even
*  with a crisis going on like
*  this. Have we stopped you
*  from eating fast food because of this?
*  Because I know you had a terrible diet.
*  We were joking around about it.
*  Well I'll tell you, you know, I have an interesting
*  I've actually lost about
*  six pounds since
*  this started this epidemic. And I think
*  well one is I've stopped sleeping, right?
*  Because I'm waking up doing
*  teleconferences
*  with Asia or Europe
*  and going to bed with
*  teleconferences with Asia trying
*  to figure out how we're going to do our vaccine
*  and we're making a unique
*  vaccine that's a low cost one that would
*  be used not only in the US but globally
*  and then all the calls
*  and everything else and
*  the one good thing
*  is that I've stopped traveling
*  and I realized that the travel
*  was really knocking the crap out of me
*  in terms of my health.
*  Yeah we've talked about that on the show.
*  All the different comedians that I
*  tour with all the time, we're all at home
*  now for the past month.
*  I'm like, God I feel great.
*  It's amazing what an impact it has
*  on your health to travel all the time.
*  Negative impact. Yeah the travel really knocks
*  so it's you know we've got a group
*  of scientists really dedicated even though
*  the labs are largely
*  closed down at Baylor and Texas Children
*  we've got special permission because they're working
*  on the COVID vaccine so they're coming in
*  this amazing dedicated group of scientists
*  and then I've
*  been basically you know on teleconferences
*  all the time.
*  I said to my wife Anne I said I feel like
*  I have to press star six just to talk to you.
*  It's just
*  been so crazy and then
*  doing all the media hits
*  and I was going to the studio for a while
*  but now I'm just doing it from my Skype
*  so I have sort of this weird subterranean
*  existence right now.
*  I mean the good news you know
*  the people I feel so terrible for are those who
*  you know now are not getting paychecks
*  because of this crisis
*  and there's so many people suffering
*  economic hardships
*  right now. You know all the
*  people who used to make my breakfast sandwich
*  in the morning now I don't see them. They're
*  presumably not getting a paycheck or
*  all those things.
*  The dry cleaners
*  and all that kind of stuff.
*  I feel so bad for them because I'm sure they don't
*  have much of a safety net at all.
*  No there's never been a time
*  where it's no one's fault
*  but half the country's out of work
*  at least.
*  It's not like anybody did
*  anything wrong. Like you could have showed up
*  for work every day, worked hard,
*  planned ahead, done all
*  the things that you need to do to have a successful
*  business and all of a sudden the carpet gets pulled
*  out from under you. Yeah no it's just
*  so heartbreaking. We're hearing so many heartbreaking
*  stories. I mean the
*  good news is you know the White House
*  and Congress is the one thing that I seem to be
*  collaborating on is getting that
*  stimulus package
*  out there to people who need it and
*  I hope there's
*  some funds for those people.
*  Yes I hope so too.
*  What's your take on Sweden
*  and Sweden's the way
*  they're handling this which is essentially
*  they're giving people the freedom
*  to go to restaurants and bars
*  and they're shutting some things
*  down but they're quite a bit more open than
*  the rest of the world and subsequently
*  they're experiencing a spike in
*  cases. Yeah I mean
*  the problem again is without a vaccine
*  or other technologies
*  we have to go back to the 14th
*  century. That's when quarantine was invented.
*  It was when ships
*  would come into the harbor in Croatia
*  and coming from Asia
*  minor and they were fearful they were bringing
*  plague and they kept the ships for 40 days.
*  That's the word where the word quarantine
*  came from and that's all we've got right now.
*  So we know
*  social distancing
*  is probably our only hope
*  and there's a few pieces of evidence
*  for that. I mean it's real serious social
*  distancing not going to restaurants and things so
*  my colleague Mark Lipsitch
*  who's a brilliant
*  epidemiologist at Harvard has been
*  you know doing a lot of analyses
*  and modeling and one of the things
*  he's shown is that when he
*  looks at the cities in China for instance
*  where they
*  did social distancing
*  and other aggressive measures
*  and some of them were pretty aggressive that you couldn't even do
*  in the United States
*  but he showed that the longer
*  you allow transmission to go on
*  before you intervene
*  with social distancing and other things
*  the worse the surge
*  and the worse the epidemic and therefore
*  as we talked about in Italy the worse the mortality.
*  So for instance in Wuhan
*  where he estimates I think
*  I forget the exact numbers I think he found
*  about six weeks of transmission
*  going on before you intervene
*  then it was lights out. It was a massive
*  surge in hospital systems
*  getting overwhelmed and a lot of health care workers
*  getting sick and I want to come back to that point
*  after we finish this
*  as opposed to in southern China
*  and other places in China
*  where you intervened after a week
*  then you got you know
*  there was the difference between having 2,000
*  patients in your ICUs across the city
*  versus 20.
*  That's how the dramatic difference so
*  that's a lesson we need to learn for the US
*  is that's the only thing
*  we have and to really push hard
*  on the social distancing
*  and I think it's especially important
*  in the cities because it looks to me
*  like what we're seeing so far
*  in the US is more of an urban
*  slash suburban versus
*  rural divide. We're seeing
*  the big surges in ICU patients
*  more in cities and rural areas
*  although Dr. Fauci I forget
*  it was last night or the other night said don't
*  ignore the rural areas either because
*  we don't know what's going to happen there.
*  So social distancing is absolutely
*  paramount and unfortunately
*  what's happening because things
*  got so fucked up with the testing
*  that we've not
*  unfortunately we've often found out
*  that transmission is going out
*  for several weeks only when a lot of
*  ICU patients started hitting the
*  door. So this is what happened in New Orleans
*  is what happened is probably happening
*  in Detroit. The mayor of Atlanta
*  just said you know all of a sudden we've had
*  all of these people show up in the
*  ICU so that's
*  another lesson learned.
*  Really not only doing the
*  diagnostic testing but the social
*  distancing is really important
*  and I've been on calls with the leadership of
*  people in Houston because
*  you know you're right it's
*  hurting the economy in
*  so many ways
*  but you know if you want to prevent Houston
*  from replicating
*  the New Orleans experience
*  I've been saying to the mayor
*  and everyone else in Houston this is
*  unfortunately what we're going to have to do and the
*  models are showing now
*  the Festic Organ Institute
*  in Washington, Seattle, Washington
*  called the Institute for Health Metrics and
*  Evaluation and it's
*  they've now been looking
*  at this they do all these amazing
*  things to look at the
*  not only
*  epidemic diseases but also
*  chronic non-communicable diseases, diabetes
*  and heart disease and mental health
*  issues but they've been you know all hands on deck
*  at this COVID epidemic and they've just
*  put it out on their website
*  it's healthdata.org and you
*  go to the COVID-19
*  site and what they're showing
*  is that they anticipate
*  the peak of this epidemic in the US
*  is going to hit about the middle of
*  April so we're not even at the peak yet
*  and so we're
*  another two weeks of this is going
*  to continue to go up and
*  in some places like in Texas it's going to
*  be delayed it's probably going to be around
*  May 2nd and I think California
*  was around there as well
*  so their numbers
*  say it's going to be the next two months
*  that are going to be the crunch time when
*  it's going to start really going up
*  and then as we move into later
*  in May it'll start
*  to go down and maybe really bottom
*  out by June of course
*  again it's a model it's a new virus pathogen
*  but what I've been saying is
*  you know the president yesterday
*  the day before said okay I understand
*  I said Easter now we're going to
*  go to April 30th and my point is
*  well April 30th things
*  are still going to be peaking in parts of the country
*  let's use April 30
*  as a time to reassess
*  and then make a decision whether we go another
*  month let's go a month at a time
*  for now until we know where this is
*  heading. How long
*  can we go? I mean
*  if you
*  let's take economics out of it
*  what would you think if there was no
*  concern whatsoever about economic
*  loss and the damage to the economy
*  what would you recommend
*  in terms of just from clearly
*  just purely from a medical perspective?
*  Well the problem is from a medical and public
*  health perspective we don't really know where this
*  virus is heading you know it's
*  I forget what Dr. Fauci said
*  the virus makes the decisions we don't make
*  the decisions so
*  although not entirely true because we can
*  make we can enact
*  intervention so
*  hopefully
*  by the summer this
*  is not going to be a huge problem
*  but we don't know and then we also
*  don't know if this thing's coming
*  back so what do the out years
*  look like is this does
*  even if it goes down this summer does
*  it does it come back up
*  again in the fall does it come
*  back up again early
*  Can I pause you for a second there?
*  Why would that happen? Why would it come back?
*  Why would it go away and then come back
*  in the fall? Well there's a few
*  things that are happening one all the social
*  distancing potentially could interrupt
*  the transmission we
*  use this number called the reproductive
*  number which describes the number
*  of people that get infected if a single
*  individual has it so the number
*  right now is between two and four
*  depending on whose numbers you look at
*  the idea is you bring that below one by the
*  social distancing there's also
*  the question of whether there's seasonality
*  to this virus and
*  again the
*  Skymark Lip stitch has done some studies
*  to show that
*  there seems the virus infection
*  doesn't seem to be as severe in areas
*  that have higher temperatures
*  and greater humidity
*  it's a bit of a soft call
*  but maybe there's going to be some seasonality
*  to this as well
*  and then and so let's use
*  another example of another seasonal virus
*  influenza you know which peaks
*  of course in the winter then goes down
*  in the summer months it never
*  really disappears but it
*  it goes down but then
*  in the southern hemisphere it's the opposite
*  so in the southern hemisphere peak
*  flu season is our summer
*  there winter in places like Australia
*  and then in the tropics it's about
*  the same all year round so we don't really
*  understand seasonality potentially
*  the virus could show start
*  showing a pattern like that
*  and then the question is does it come
*  back year after year after year like flu does
*  or
*  and show some kind of seasonality
*  these are all scenarios that are
*  being looked at so for instance our vaccine
*  if it's used
*  and goes through all the clinical
*  testing hurdles probably
*  is not going to be used for this 2020 epidemic
*  if it's used at all it's going to be
*  used in the out years
*  if this virus starts to
*  come back on a regular basis
*  Is there any
*  other way to handle this in terms
*  of quarantining
*  or social distancing
*  like is there
*  would it be possible
*  to quarantine the people that
*  are at most risk instead
*  of the general population
*  well again
*  the problem gets to the fact that
*  you know again there's
*  this idea
*  that this is
*  only among older
*  Americans and people over the age of 70
*  diabetes hypertension but now
*  as the Centers for Disease Control
*  has been reporting we've had
*  this big flux of young
*  adults getting very sick and in the
*  ICU so at what point do you say
*  pretty much everybody potentially
*  is at risk then among the children
*  even though the children generally
*  are children adolescents
*  seem to do pretty well with this virus
*  now we realize
*  from studies coming out of China that was
*  published in the journal called Pediatrics
*  put out by the American Academy
*  of Pediatrics about 10% of infants
*  are getting very sick with this
*  virus so infants are at risk
*  so you start adding it up okay
*  older people
*  those underlying diabetes hypertension
*  and younger adults and 40
*  and 50 year olds as well
*  and we're hearing all these stories on CNN
*  and elsewhere about you know
*  valued colleagues you know in their
*  50s and that kind of thing getting
*  really sick or even even dying
*  and then infants after a while
*  it's just you can't
*  slice it that fine
*  it becomes
*  impossible to do it
*  one of the things that's
*  come up about this is
*  people are now aware
*  people like myself are aware
*  of the number of people that die
*  every year in the United States from the flu
*  which is staggering
*  it's a lot more than I ever thought before
*  you know like
*  do you know the numbers like what
*  yeah so you know
*  seasonal flu is really bad it's
*  and it varies year
*  to year different variances of the flu
*  so it usually goes between
*  12 and 50,000 people
*  die every year of influenza
*  and the vast majority of those by the way
*  are not vaccinated so even in years
*  where there's not a good match between
*  the flu vaccine and the flu
*  it could still reduce your likelihood of
*  hospitalization and death
*  so that's an important message to get out
*  the numbers here unfortunately
*  are looking worse so
*  can I pause you for a second how does that work?
*  how even if it's not matched up
*  to the correct seasonal flu
*  how does it prevent you from
*  being hospitalized?
*  because it's partially protective so if you imagine
*  a virus
*  that has all of these different pieces
*  to it
*  and all the
*  antibodies each reacting to a different
*  piece of the virus
*  in a perfect match all of the antibodies
*  target the virus and in a
*  less than perfect match only some of the antibodies
*  target the virus
*  and therefore it's partially protective
*  and can you know have a
*  partial effect and
*  so I was going to say oh so
*  the it's different and now the
*  numbers of Americans who are
*  dying are all over the map so if you
*  believe the numbers saying that they're
*  between 4 and 10 times
*  the number of Americans
*  and I forget about Americans
*  4 to 10 times
*  COVID the SARS 2 virus
*  that causes COVID-19 is
*  4 to 10 times more
*  lethal than regular flu
*  so that'll give you the bracket
*  so the minimum is 12,000
*  from flu the minimum that's going to
*  die from COVID-19 is
*  around 50,000 and at the
*  high end times 10 could be
*  between 500,000 so that's where you're
*  hearing those numbers
*  from the White House press conference
*  saying maybe 100 to 200,000
*  Americans could die
*  I think it's probably
*  I like the Institute
*  for Health Metrics numbers
*  that just came out they say 84,000
*  Americans will die
*  in that peak season going
*  from April May
*  and June and then but we don't
*  know what will happen again in the
*  year so the point is a lot of Americans are going to die
*  I'm hoping
*  it doesn't get as high as 200,000
*  and again the modelers
*  are really looking at this
*  those numbers that I gave you that estimate was a sort of
*  simplistic version
*  there's much more sophisticated models
*  but again they're models based on assumptions
*  with the new virus pathogen it's
*  hard to get all the assumptions
*  right but the point is many more
*  people will die of this virus than even
*  in a bad flu season
*  I think people are concerned
*  that this is kind of setting a precedent
*  and that this is going to be something that we have to do
*  in the future is there a way to prevent
*  something like this a full
*  shutdown of the country
*  to happen in the future?
*  Well the way is you know
*  we've got this incredible scientific
*  infrastructure in America right?
*  The best research universities and institutes
*  in the world and I
*  work at two of them at Baylor College of Medicine
*  and Texas Children's Hospital
*  and now I'm doing a few things
*  with Texas A&M University
*  and Baylor University as well
*  and Rice and so the
*  the answer is
*  this is why we
*  have
*  an NIH with a budget
*  of 36 billion dollars annually
*  we need to have
*  a pipeline of technologies getting ready
*  for this epidemic
*  we should have
*  you know if we had
*  all the funding we needed for our coronavirus
*  vaccine program we would have had
*  several coronavirus vaccines in
*  clinical trials and potentially we could have
*  combined them in a way to be ready
*  to go now
*  so having, figuring out a way
*  to support
*  organizations that don't
*  are, that are
*  looking at vaccines and other countermeasures
*  not in terms of products they can sell
*  that are going to help
*  the health security
*  of the country I think is really important
*  so one of the books
*  that I wrote is called Blue Marble Health
*  and it finds this
*  unusual, and we spoke a little bit about this
*  last time, the unusual number of
*  illnesses from
*  emerging infections like this one
*  and poverty related neglected
*  diseases actually in the G20
*  countries, the G20 economies
*  the 20 wealthiest economies
*  especially the poor living in those actually
*  account for most of these diseases
*  and the problem is the G20
*  economies are not stepping up
*  to support these technologies we still
*  rely too much on the US
*  and the UK and the European Union
*  we've got to do better with China
*  and Brazil and some of these countries
*  to help fund these global health
*  technologies because that's all we have
*  otherwise we go back, again, back to the
*  14th century in terms of social
*  isolation
*  It seems one of the critical aspects of
*  getting through this is having a strong immune
*  system. What
*  emphasis, if any
*  are you guys putting on
*  developing techniques
*  or at least educating people
*  on how to strengthen their immune system
*  and how to keep the body healthy?
*  Certainly keeping
*  the body healthy is key, right?
*  I mean, one of the populations
*  that this virus is devastating
*  are those with hypertension
*  and underlying heart disease
*  and actually we're learning this virus itself
*  not only causes lung disease but heart disease
*  as well so we can talk about that
*  but keeping your
*  keeping yourself healthy
*  could make the difference between
*  life or death but
*  even in a healthy individual
*  with a new virus
*  pathogen and you've never seen before
*  it takes time to train the immune
*  system and then it's too late because
*  the virus has already done incredible
*  damage to your lungs so
*  no question about it. Don't smoke
*  don't vape
*  drinking in moderation
*  and
*  keeping fit
*  avoiding hypertension
*  and diabetes if you can
*  especially type 2 diabetes
*  not everybody can do it and there's
*  some genetic predisposition
*  to it but if you can keep your body
*  healthy that will definitely stack the deck
*  in your favor. I was reading something
*  about sauna use regular sauna use
*  and viral infections and the
*  diminished impact of viral infections
*  on people who regularly use a sauna
*  because of heat shock proteins and cytokines
*  are you aware of anything that goes along those lines?
*  That's a new one for me. That's a new one for you.
*  Interesting idea. Now
*  as far as yourself
*  I joked around about the fast food
*  stuff because we joked around about
*  that last time you were here but have you
*  altered your approach to
*  food because of this and diet?
*  Well I have
*  partly because I've been so upset
*  and so anxious to eat
*  that you know I've
*  it's just been on teleconferences
*  and my wife will actually
*  we set up a little study here in our
*  bedroom and it's not much
*  but my wife will just bring me a plate
*  of food and I'll just you know
*  eat it and then whatevers but I
*  it's not
*  that I've I can't say that I've
*  been trying to eat certainly eat a healthier diet
*  and be more careful and my wife spends a lot of time
*  trying to take care of me but right now
*  I've just been so upset about
*  what I'm seeing not only
*  with people suffering in the hospital
*  but people economically put
*  out of work and I'm
*  so worried about all
*  of these health care providers who are getting
*  sick that you know I just
*  don't even want to eat and I don't
*  sleep much either. I'll wake up you know four in the
*  morning you know look at the numbers
*  from the night before and where COVID
*  is heading and then I'm on teleconferences all day
*  trying to figure out how we
*  accelerate this vaccine and
*  it's interesting I've even noticed
*  that I've become a lot more emotional
*  in my meetings
*  and
*  you know I'm known as a pretty
*  even tempered person never getting upset
*  I've gotten really upset a few times
*  over the last
*  couple of months surprising my colleagues
*  and I think what's bothering me
*  the most is what I see
*  happening to the nurses and the docs
*  and the respiratory therapists
*  they're just getting so hammered
*  and a lot of them
*  are my former students my
*  medical students and you
*  know I remember you know we have
*  in medicine yesterday called match day you know
*  where if you're a fourth year medical
*  student you open this envelope and figure
*  out and you learn where you're going to do your
*  your residency whether it's in
*  internal medicine or surgery or
*  ear nose and throat or neurosurgery
*  or whatever and you know a lot of the medical students
*  would come and see me Dr. Hotez
*  hey where should I go do residency
*  and a lot of them I would say
*  you know it's great spending some time in New York
*  you know I did my MD and my PhD
*  in New York met my wife in New York
*  it's a great city great medical
*  centers Mount Sinai and Columbia
*  and Cornell and NYU
*  and Einstein it's fantastic
*  living in the city and I'm really
*  what the hell did I send them into
*  they're there with no
*  with inadequate protective equipment
*  you know scared as hell of getting
*  getting sick or worse and
*  and being overwhelmed by patients
*  I think I said I don't forget
*  with CNN or MSNBC or whatever
*  I felt like I sent them to hell you know
*  and feeling a lot of
*  guilt for being so enthusiastic
*  about having them go to the hospitals
*  in New York of course you can never know what
*  what was going to happen but
*  that's been bothering me as well
*  so
*  this has been a very emotional time for me
*  the lack of sleep
*  also has a big impact
*  on the immune system
*  it really picks up your immune system
*  no doubt about it now with you
*  is it simply just because
*  of anxiety is it a lack
*  of time to sleep properly
*  and have you looked into any sort
*  of meditative practices or anything that can
*  calm the mind and allow you to
*  perhaps get a little bit more sleep which would
*  significantly probably improve your immune system
*  yeah no question
*  well I've looked in well
*  one of the reasons is a practical matter because I've been doing
*  some evening
*  TV interviews
*  and they're great opportunities
*  because they reach such large audiences
*  I mean I've been on everything from
*  Chris Hayes to Tucker Carlson
*  to Hannity and you know
*  how many people do that right
*  going to the extremes on the political
*  spectrum but it's been a great opportunity
*  but I deliberately try to be on all those
*  networks to show that I don't give a shit about the
*  politics this is about
*  saving people's lives and they've been great
*  to be a voice so I don't want to lose that opportunity
*  but then I'm getting up
*  early in the morning either for teleconferences
*  or do CNN
*  New Day or
*  or American Newsroom with
*  Sandra Smith and
*  Ed Henry and those these are amazing
*  opportunities I'll never get
*  a chance to talk to the
*  country like that although I did a little bit
*  with Ebola and then with Zika
*  and then to talk
*  about our vaccine and it's also really
*  important for Americans to hear
*  about scientists because working scientists
*  tend to be invisible in this
*  country and I have a paper I just put out
*  in the public library of science and PLOS
*  biology about
*  how the fact that
*  scientists are invisible and are enabling
*  for anti-science movements to rise
*  and I blame part of it on our
*  scientific profession that we're too quiet
*  so here I have this chance I'm trying to
*  take advantage of that but then I'm in teleconference
*  after teleconference all day
*  you know trying to get this vaccine
*  moving so
*  you can't even take a nap sometimes
*  and so it catches catches up to you
*  so
*  yeah I've got to figure I still have to
*  figure that one out but it's
*  it's something
*  you're concentrating on yeah
*  one of the things that you brought up that I wanted to
*  discuss is the damage that this
*  virus does to the lungs
*  and to
*  the heart as well what
*  there's scarring on people's
*  lungs
*  talk about that and what if anything
*  can be done to try to heal those
*  people post infection
*  well so what happens is
*  you know the virus gains entry
*  into the deep passages
*  of the lungs you know the
*  all the airway spaces and then
*  it has if you ever see a cartoon
*  a schematic drawing of a coronavirus
*  it looks like a little ball
*  with spikes sticking out of it and
*  those spikes are called the S protein
*  and actually the vaccine that we're making
*  interferes with
*  the binding of a part of that S protein
*  called the receptor binding domain for binding
*  into the receptor
*  so it uses those spikes the
*  tip of the spikes to get entry
*  to bind to the receptors
*  in the lung which is actually a
*  an enzyme called the acetylcholinesterase
*  and it gets into the lung cells
*  so the first thing that happens
*  is a large amount of virus is getting
*  into the lungs and that
*  triggers what's called the innate immune
*  system meaning your natural first line
*  body of defense
*  and it signals something called toll
*  like receptors which cause a lot of
*  inflammation and so
*  you're seeing a big inflammatory
*  response to the
*  virus so the two components
*  are a lot of virus
*  causing direct damage
*  and then the host all the inflammatory
*  response and that's one of the reasons why
*  you know when I heard about hydroxychloric when I had
*  some enthusiasm because it can maybe suppress
*  the inflammatory component whether
*  it clinically has
*  the ability to make a difference I think
*  the jury's still out yet but
*  so you've got those two things going on
*  the other thing that's happening besides
*  and that's causing severe lung disease
*  and there's all that inflammation and it
*  causes a condition known as
*  ARDS acute respiratory
*  distress syndrome where there's so much
*  inflammation and scarring
*  that it becomes difficult to
*  oxygenate the lungs and people go
*  into shock because of this
*  ARDS syndrome so that's
*  why a lot of people are dying
*  the other thing that happens though and
*  we don't really understand the mechanism is
*  been a lot of reports and by the way you can
*  anybody can download this there's this fantastic
*  pre-print server
*  called bio archive and med archive
*  it's put up by cold spring harbor
*  laboratories and I check it
*  every morning it's called BIO
*  RXIV and
*  med archive is MED RXIV
*  it's put up by cold spring harbor
*  laboratories so scientists have been great about
*  sharing information they're putting all
*  their stuff up on these pre-print servers
*  they're not peer reviewed yet but just
*  so we can get information into
*  the hands of the scientists and anybody can look at
*  them but one of the other things we're seeing
*  with that is a lot of heart injury
*  whether people are having heart attacks
*  because they're intubated
*  in the ICU and under stress and
*  they're in shock so they're not
*  perfusing the heart or
*  and we know that
*  the old SARS virus SARS 1 had
*  the ability to go into the heart tissue
*  and cause what's called myocarditis
*  actual infection of the heart
*  so it's really the heart and lungs
*  that are getting knocked out
*  there's also some evidence that the virus
*  can go into the intestinal tract as well
*  and so that
*  could actually be a potential
*  route of transmission
*  meaning fecal oral transmission
*  as well so this is why
*  people are getting so hammered is this direct
*  damage from the virus
*  and the inflammatory component to
*  the heart and the lung. Is there any
*  understanding of what if anything
*  can be done to try to heal
*  these people post infection
*  particularly like damage to the lungs?
*  Yeah I think you know there are
*  there's a question of whether steroids
*  actually help or hurt. Steroids are
*  always a mixed bag because steroids
*  can suppress
*  inflammation and help the inflammatory
*  component but they also
*  suppress the immune response to the
*  virus so you can have
*  an increased number of virus
*  particles potentially so people are
*  definitely looking into steroids
*  other anti-inflammatory
*  drugs but you know
*  those who survive this
*  and fortunately most do
*  you know you'll find that they're
*  probably tell you they've been hacking and coughing
*  for a long time
*  afterwards and a lot of that is and we see
*  this with flu as well and other
*  viral pneumonia is it's not because
*  they're still infected with the virus it's all that
*  scarring is it takes the
*  body a long time to remodel
*  all the scar tissue
*  and before the
*  coughing stops so we can anticipate
*  that happening as well. Do we think
*  it's possible to fully recover from this
*  for people that do experience these lung
*  scarring issues? Yeah I think
*  so especially for younger people
*  for older people you know they may
*  have some permanent
*  pulmonary deficits but we don't know it's still
*  too early in this
*  epidemic to know. Is
*  that a big part of what's going on is that it's just
*  really too early for
*  so many of these things the treatments the cures
*  the dealing with the immune
*  systems finding out which people are genetically
*  more predisposed to the virus? Just by
*  time and
*  you know typically it can take years
*  and years to figure all of this
*  out and we're all you know everybody's
*  working overtime trying
*  to try to make a contribution
*  figure this out.
*  The great news is the data
*  sharing among scientists has just been
*  been amazing everyone's
*  you know putting aside their eco
*  putting all their stuff up on
*  bioarchive, meta archive and
*  the major journals
*  are doing incredible things
*  also expediting
*  publication of papers so you know
*  the flagship journals like
*  New England Journal of Medicine,
*  Lancet, JAMA they're all putting that stuff
*  out there as fast as they can
*  you know ensuring
*  quality and a level of
*  peer review are plus family
*  of journals public library of science so
*  so you know if you look at
*  the good stories that are happening around
*  this definitely the data sharing
*  the
*  you know journals
*  not conducting business as usual
*  recognizing that they're
*  the stuff that they're publishing
*  could be life saving and responding
*  to a public health crisis.
*  I think that's been a nice part of the story.
*  I'm hoping so much
*  of what comes out of this is a wake up call
*  so much of the
*  new found understanding and appreciation
*  for the science behind dealing with these diseases
*  appreciation
*  of health care workers and first responders
*  I mean if there's any bright
*  lining to this that's what I'm really hoping
*  for is that people wake up and
*  recognize the good work
*  that people like you have been doing
*  and also you know that this is
*  where we live in strange times
*  and these things can happen again
*  and we need to be prepared and we need to put a lot
*  of emphasis and effort and thought
*  to that as a whole as a whole
*  society. Right that's right.
*  I think you know maybe this will help us
*  reassess some of our values and
*  and you know appreciate
*  some of the some of the things that
*  the health care professions especially
*  are doing and you know you're seeing
*  people volunteer you know
*  going right you know right into the
*  belly of the beast you know people
*  you know who might have subspecialty
*  practices
*  they just had the hell with it. I'm just
*  going to put on my N95 mask
*  and my PPE and dive in
*  and help and that's
*  really moving. Why have there
*  been such a shortage of
*  masks and safety equipment
*  for health care workers
*  and how did this
*  ever happen? Well we just
*  we didn't get ready for the surgeon
*  time I think
*  you know I think you know I'm
*  sort of holding back trying
*  to throw stones at
*  this agency or
*  this person or this group
*  because we don't really know what happened
*  I think it's going to be really important
*  that Congress
*  after this conduct
*  an investigation not from the standpoint
*  of prosecuting people or
*  or calling them out but just say hey
*  what the hell went wrong here and
*  and how do we avoid this
*  again I mean the problems with the testing
*  and not having all the protective
*  equipment. Now we're getting geared up
*  in mobilizing industry but
*  what could we have done better especially
*  in that window period
*  when things were collapsing
*  in Wuhan and the other cities in central
*  China when we knew
*  this was going to be bad and we knew
*  this could become you know one of the
*  great pandemic threats you know why
*  how could we have better
*  used those six weeks
*  in order to get ready
*  and what didn't we do?
*  And now's not the time to
*  do it because the last thing you want
*  to do is start distracting people and
*  worrying about you know
*  congressional hearings
*  and that sort of thing
*  but when all this is said and done
*  it has to be done
*  in the right spirit not again we have
*  to figure out a way to stop
*  these partisan lines to say you know
*  as a country we've got to
*  figure out how to work together I know that sounds
*  Pollyannish but you know when I was
*  in you know before I moved to Texas
*  a decade ago I was chair of microbiology
*  at George Washington University
*  for 10 years
*  and I worked with congress
*  a lot to get legislation passed around
*  neglected tropical diseases
*  and it was a different Washington then I mean I would
*  go you know to
*  Sam Brownback's prayer breakfast
*  Sam Brownback's governor of Kansas
*  before he was senator from Kansas very
*  conservative publican senator
*  walk across the hall and go talk to
*  Senator Leahy's people from
*  Vermont or Sherrod Brown's people
*  and you know
*  far to the left
*  and nobody thought twice about that
*  you know we all knew we had to
*  go across the aisle to work together and
*  it's just not happening anymore and it's
*  tearing apart our country
*  so I hope the other thing that
*  we get out of this is
*  figuring out a way that
*  republicans start talking to democrats again
*  and democrats talk to republicans
*  again and
*  figure that out as well
*  Well Peter I appreciate your time
*  and I know you're incredibly busy
*  is there anything else that you need to say
*  or you think should be said about this before
*  we wrap this up?
*  I thought we talked a lot you know I can't tell you
*  how important it is
*  to use your voice to amplify
*  you know a straightforward discussion
*  about this epidemic
*  I think you know you're and just by
*  doing that you're making a huge contribution
*  because you have incredible bandwidth
*  and extraordinary
*  audience I mean I had the last
*  I can't tell you the last time I did
*  talked about your
*  I was on your show I think it was last year around
*  this time actually
*  you know the response I got about neglected
*  diseases of poverty in the US
*  and vaccines and you have so much
*  you're such
*  a powerful show and powerful guy
*  and you know being able to use this time
*  to talk about COVID is
*  19 and what SARS is
*  and why and how we deal with
*  pandemic threats it's absolutely
*  huge so I'm very grateful for the opportunity
*  Well we're very very grateful
*  for you Peter and let's
*  talk again in person during better times
*  Absolutely
*  Thank you sir take care and be safe out there
*  All the best
*  God bless
