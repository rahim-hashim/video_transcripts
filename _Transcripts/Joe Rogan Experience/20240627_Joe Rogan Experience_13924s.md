*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, I went to the gym and, you know, been eating well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=20.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=25.76s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=26.76s)]
*  Trying to take care of the vessel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=27.76s)]
*  It was my first day that I didn't work out for a whole month because we did that sober [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=28.76s)]
*  October thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=31.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Worked out every day of the week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  So do you, is that not your usual, your norm? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Not usually, but I kind of did it in September to get ready for October to just like get [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=37.08s)]
*  my body conditioned to this idea that we're going at it every day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=41.88s)]
*  Do you, and do you guys have like a contest of like who burns the most calories or something? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=51.44s)]
*  We can't have a contest because we just get too stupid because Burt drives me crazy and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=52.44s)]
*  then I go psycho. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=56.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  So we decided no more contests because we did a contest that one year and we went insane. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  I was doing cardio like seven hours a day. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=62.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=64.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=65.56s)]
*  Because it was a contest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=66.56s)]
*  How did you do, and you did a podcast and you have a family. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=67.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  I would just get up in the morning and bang out seven hours of cardio. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  What time do you get up? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Then I was getting up at like seven. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  So seven and I was just going straight, I'd just have some caffeine and go straight to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  the gym. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=82.88s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=83.88s)]
*  But I was just, it was psychotic. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=84.88s)]
*  We were just in competition with each other. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=88.28s)]
*  It was totally unsustainable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=90.88s)]
*  I don't have that edge of like, I mean I can power through some stuff. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Like I was actually working on it for a little bit and I liked it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=97.96s)]
*  But after like the two hour workout and then like we didn't stretch, you know, and then [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  I'd like go home and stretch and I was like, I just didn't have that much time in my day [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=109.16s)]
*  to dedicate to it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=113.24s)]
*  It's impressive that you can just power through your discomfort. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  If you don't want to go, you still go. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=121.08s)]
*  I'm not good at that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  The key is to like not have a way out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=128.52s)]
*  And one of the things about this contest thing, or well this Sober October thing wasn't a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=129.52s)]
*  contest, but we had to do a 500 calorie workout every day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=133.36s)]
*  So you had to burn 500 calories, which is if you do sprints on the Airdine machine, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=137.12s)]
*  it takes about 45 minutes to hit 500 calories. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=142.48s)]
*  So it's 45 minutes of 20 second sprints, 10 second rest, 20 second sprint, 10 second rest. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=152.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=153.44s)]
*  Or you could lift weights, which is way easier, but that's more like an hour and a half. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=154.44s)]
*  That's my favorite mode. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=159.0s)]
*  Lifting weights? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=161.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=162.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=163.32s)]
*  And it's the best results for me too. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=164.32s)]
*  Like I hate running, but if something happens in my life and I'm like enraged, I'll just [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=165.32s)]
*  run five miles without even blinking. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=170.4s)]
*  I will just like black out run because I'm so mad. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=172.8s)]
*  Well running is like one of the best things to alleviate anxiety. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=177.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=179.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=180.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=181.84s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=182.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=183.84s)]
*  You just get that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=184.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=185.84s)]
*  Because if you really push really hard, it sort of rings out all the shit in your body. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=186.84s)]
*  It's all the fucking tension. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=188.36s)]
*  It's like a washcloth just rings it out. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Do we ever talk about Dr. John Sarno's healing back pain? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=198.08s)]
*  Some of it is very applicable and some of it is like, all right, I could probably also [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=199.8s)]
*  have a back problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=205.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=206.68s)]
*  I think both of those things are true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=207.68s)]
*  I heard people talking about it in a very factual way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=209.08s)]
*  Your back pain is all mental. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=215.12s)]
*  Some people have bulging discs and they push against their nerves and they have real problems. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=216.12s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  And then some people do have some weird sort of psychological thing where they're tensed [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  up and their back is fucked up and it's all in their mind. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=225.44s)]
*  Well, I've definitely had in the middle of an argument with a family member, all of a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=228.16s)]
*  sudden my neck just starts locking down my shoulder blade. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=233.08s)]
*  It's like a specific area with a specific familial wound. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=236.28s)]
*  Isn't it funny how if you look back on those moments though, how trivial they really all [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=242.12s)]
*  are, those things that fuck you up and get you tense and get you mad, in the overall [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=247.24s)]
*  scheme of things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=252.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=254.04s)]
*  Do you ever contemplate your death once a day and then everything, the whole landscape [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  of your worries changes? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=260.32s)]
*  No. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=261.32s)]
*  I don't do a lot of that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=262.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=265.32s)]
*  I do that sometimes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=266.32s)]
*  Contemplate your death? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=267.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=268.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=269.32s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, none of this shit matters then. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=270.32s)]
*  I mean, really. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Definitely most of it doesn't matter. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just in the moment, it seems like it matters because it's the most pressing thing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=275.44s)]
*  that's on your mind currently. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  And especially if you don't have power over what's happening or something's going on, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=280.48s)]
*  it's beyond your control, it's overwhelming sometimes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=284.92s)]
*  So it becomes your primary focus. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=288.88s)]
*  I got really good at stuff like that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=292.2s)]
*  Well, not really good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=294.6s)]
*  I don't want to toot my own horn, but my husband is a, he's a tough guy and because he's had [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=295.6s)]
*  to be and he has taught me so much about boundaries, which have been lacking for most of my life. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=303.48s)]
*  Setting boundaries for other people? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=313.68s)]
*  And for myself as well. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  But having this somewhat of a doormat kind of life, me being the doormat, because I love [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=316.64s)]
*  everybody so much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=324.4s)]
*  So I get myself into trouble with wanting to help, I guess. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=325.84s)]
*  And then getting in this washing machine of dysfunction with my family or not the right [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=333.64s)]
*  kind of friend. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=339.96s)]
*  And I started getting good at saying, hey, this is where I'm drawing a line. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  I love you, but this is the line. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  And my worries have changed in my dedication to that, which was really hard, because I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  don't want to let people down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  How many people are you having to let down? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Quite a few. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, you're very nice. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  That's probably part of the problem. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=366.08s)]
*  One of the things that happens is people use you as their solution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=368.68s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=372.36s)]
*  Which is not fun. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=373.36s)]
*  And I want to help, because I know a lot of stuff and I want to share it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=374.36s)]
*  And then they get mad at you still. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=378.04s)]
*  You kind of become this mother figure thing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=379.96s)]
*  But I'm learning about myself too and what that means for me and my ego. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=384.32s)]
*  And it's very humbling. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=389.72s)]
*  But I've kind of got a pit bull for a husband who helps defend me against those poor choices. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=391.72s)]
*  Well, that's good though. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=399.92s)]
*  You've got someone looking out for you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=401.48s)]
*  That's important in life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=404.48s)]
*  Sometimes you see the way people live their life and you're like, oh, well, I've got to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  get more of that in me. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  How do I do more of that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=410.88000000000005s)]
*  If you live with the person, it's like if it's your husband, it's easier to model. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=412.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he does it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=416.12s)]
*  I'm going to fucking do that too. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=417.68s)]
*  He's right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=418.68s)]
*  Lookit, there you go. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=419.68s)]
*  Well, we balance each other out in that way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=421.08s)]
*  I soften him up a little bit and he toughens me up. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's nice. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=425.96s)]
*  That's good. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=427.08s)]
*  That's the yin and yang of life, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=428.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=430.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=431.08s)]
*  Oh, I love it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=432.08s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=433.08s)]
*  It's nice and it works out. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=434.08s)]
*  It sucks when people are two yins or two yangs and they're just fucking, or they accentuate [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=435.08s)]
*  each other's mental illness. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=439.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  Fucking A. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a lot of relationships, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  It really is. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  Every day is like the dedication is balanced. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=446.48s)]
*  Whether we're up against our own discord or the world, you could pick up your phone and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=451.48s)]
*  just be set off in seconds into some labyrinth of someone else's thoughts or agenda. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=458.6s)]
*  And I'm just so over it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=466.44s)]
*  So over it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=468.68s)]
*  And then you have to come to the realization that some people never fix any problems. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=469.68s)]
*  They just have new ones. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  And those people that's like, this is like a fundamental error in the way they approach [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=476.55999999999995s)]
*  life and your help is not going to fix that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=480.64s)]
*  I think that's the same people that are still obsessed with COVID. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=483.64s)]
*  They moved it to something else. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=487.32s)]
*  And then they moved it to COVID, which was like this undeniable wet blanket of escapism. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=489.44s)]
*  Because you could get everybody can get, you can all get mad and then blame it on other [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=494.84s)]
*  people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=502.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  Fucking over that too. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  It's interesting seeing even people that were like hardcore vaccine advocates that are now [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  saying if they had known that it didn't stop transmission, didn't stop infection and it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=512.64s)]
*  only lasted X amount of months, they wouldn't have done it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=518.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=522.2s)]
*  They really weren't at the same risk level that they thought they were at when all that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=523.2s)]
*  shit was being forced on people. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=527.0s)]
*  Now the CDC is recommending it for kids. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=529.08s)]
*  Oh, it's so stupid. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=531.36s)]
*  Putting as far as like the kids vaccine schedule. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=533.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=536.0s)]
*  Well, that's because that's that liability thing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=537.0s)]
*  Do you know about that? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=539.16s)]
*  Like the reason that they got that approval is so it like covers their asses for some [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=541.52s)]
*  long game liability if there's side effects to it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=549.28s)]
*  I'm kind of butchering that, but there's some legalized upside to them making it a recommended [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=554.0s)]
*  vaccine for children along with polio or tetanus. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=562.56s)]
*  It's really fucked up. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=567.8s)]
*  Where was I listening to that? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=568.8s)]
*  I think it was no agenda. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=571.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=572.56s)]
*  Sounds like no agenda. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=573.56s)]
*  But I just butchered it so sorry guys. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=575.64s)]
*  Adam's the man. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=578.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=580.88s)]
*  They're both great. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=581.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=582.88s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=583.88s)]
*  But yeah, that it's probably part of it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  There's probably some sort of legal reason why they're doing it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=588.16s)]
*  I'm just kind of I think it's interesting, you know, now that there's this like, you [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=591.36s)]
*  know, amnesty thing with COVID, like trying to just be like, let's just all say we're [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=596.0s)]
*  sorry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=601.2s)]
*  And you know, like people had to watch their dying loved ones pass on their iPhones and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=602.2s)]
*  shit. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=609.08s)]
*  And like, I'm not I'm not like, I don't know. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=610.84s)]
*  I was already over it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  Like my industry like I'm not vaccinated. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=616.44s)]
*  So I got you know, I lost tours. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=618.96s)]
*  I had like a good deal of momentum that was taken out of my last record, which really [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  sucked. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  But I'm really glad I made the choice I did. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, nobody's nobody's like, nobody's like knocking on my door to apologize or [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=630.8399999999999s)]
*  anything. Not that I need it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's just a weird time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=639.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's so many people that had such a high level of anxiety already. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=640.64s)]
*  And then COVID came along. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=645.76s)]
*  And that was just overwhelming for them to deal with this existential threat that you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  can't control. That's everywhere. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=652.76s)]
*  And it's invisible. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=654.12s)]
*  I mean, it had all the all the elements you needed to really freak people out that were [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  already frayed. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=659.28s)]
*  And some people just aren't that resilient. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=661.16s)]
*  No, they're not. You really can see that now. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=663.68s)]
*  I feel like I lost a lot of good guys out there. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=666.68s)]
*  Not really. I don't think you did. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=669.04s)]
*  But the people that you lost from that, it's like, you know, come on. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=671.24s)]
*  Well, you know, at this point, I'm amazed at the, like, snowball of, you know, fear [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=676.36s)]
*  and the way people were so easily controlled. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=686.56s)]
*  And then you throw in your, like, freedom of speech. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=689.88s)]
*  And now you can't say it. You can't talk about it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=692.36s)]
*  You can't talk about this, this or this without people going nuclear on you and like [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=694.4s)]
*  getting a whole gang of maniacs who disagree. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  It's like, why can't you just disagree? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like, it's pretty. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=707.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's pretty, you know, Orwellian. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=712.24s)]
*  And also, I've been reading a lot of Greek mythology lately, and it's just like a Greek [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=715.76s)]
*  tragedy, you know, the madness of the gods, you know, and then like, you know, Covid [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=721.0s)]
*  kind of became this god that made people nuts. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=728.4s)]
*  You know, this like invisible force. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=732.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=735.16s)]
*  That, you know, created a cult following. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=736.88s)]
*  It also exposed a serious problem that people have with their own personal health. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  So many people just don't take care of themselves. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=745.08s)]
*  And those are the people that were the most stressed out because they had the most to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=747.28s)]
*  lose. They were the most at fear. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=750.16s)]
*  Sure. Because they've been spending so much time eating shitty food and living a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=751.92s)]
*  sedentary lifestyle with a very vulnerable immune system. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=755.84s)]
*  So something came along like this and they wanted everyone to protect them. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=759.72s)]
*  Right. You know, and that's part of what it was. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, you're going to get me fucked up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like that. That was the threat. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=767.96s)]
*  People wear your fucking mask. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=769.52s)]
*  Like all that shit. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=770.96s)]
*  It's really strange. Like, yeah, people I've known for years and years and years like [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  lost their fucking minds. Yeah, it's good. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=777.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. It is suffering. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=780.96s)]
*  It's good to know who can keep it together. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. It's good. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  I appreciate those moments of clarity. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=788.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because, you know, and it's also good to see people lose their fucking minds and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=791.4s)]
*  then regain them. Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=795.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, I was a little out of line there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=797.64s)]
*  Sure. Just realize that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=799.1199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, good. Be accountable. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=800.5999999999999s)]
*  That's great. I'm a big fan of that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=802.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that's the way through the other stuff I cannot hang with. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  I just wish people would like recognize, like en masse, that this is a real issue [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=808.32s)]
*  with personal health and you should take care of yourself. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=814.08s)]
*  You should exercise regularly. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=817.88s)]
*  You should take vitamins. You should eat well. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=820.2s)]
*  Eat good food. Well, there's a whole, you know, there's a whole agenda, you know, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=823.12s)]
*  anti health. Like if you're if you're if you go to the gym and you're into eating [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=827.6s)]
*  well or eating carnivore, you must be a racist Republican. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=833.08s)]
*  There's there's a whole identity attached to it. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=836.76s)]
*  Yeah. If you work out, you must be a Republican. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=839.52s)]
*  Yeah. There's all kinds of like it's it's this. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=842.4s)]
*  Oh, it's very silly. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=845.3599999999999s)]
*  Just very silly. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=846.92s)]
*  You got to let yourself go. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=848.4799999999999s)]
*  Oh, you should. In order to prove your, you know, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  your dedication to doing the right thing. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=854.0s)]
*  How does that make any sense? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  I get you know, I get the whole body positivity thing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  They should be happy with your body. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=860.88s)]
*  Yeah, you should be happy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  You also should take care of yourself. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=864.24s)]
*  It's like better. It's like fundamentally better. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=866.2s)]
*  Undeniably better. Sure. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=869.76s)]
*  Take care of yourself. You're more resilient. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And if you did take care of yourself and you went into this thing healthy, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=873.16s)]
*  you were less threatened. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=878.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's something we found out. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=880.4s)]
*  It's like that probably applies to most things. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=882.16s)]
*  Kids, you know, except like the Spanish. Absolutely. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=883.88s)]
*  Well, and just yeah, your overall mental health. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=887.32s)]
*  I think Spanish flu was actually worse if you were healthy. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=889.72s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=892.28s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=893.76s)]
*  I think the Spanish flu primarily attacked people that were young. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=895.2s)]
*  Like it did something to your immune system. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  Like if your immune system was young and strong, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=900.88s)]
*  like it actually fought against your immune system. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=903.08s)]
*  We got lucky with this one. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=906.48s)]
*  This one was lucky because it actually favored people that were healthy [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=908.16s)]
*  and including children, favored people that were young and resilient [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=911.76s)]
*  and really, really fuck people up that were overweight more than anything. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=915.36s)]
*  People that were fat. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=920.32s)]
*  You know, there was a thing about COVID, the way it interacts with fat. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=921.72s)]
*  It actually replicates in fat. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=925.28s)]
*  So like people with fat got a higher dose. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=927.88s)]
*  It was a higher viral load. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=931.84s)]
*  Figure out what that was, Jamie. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=933.6s)]
*  Like something about being obese, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  uniquely targeted people for COVID. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=938.52s)]
*  It's something about this particular virus, the way it affected obese people, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=941.48s)]
*  which is like 78 percent at one point in time with the people in the ICU. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  They were obese. Right. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=949.2s)]
*  Which is wild. Right. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=950.8s)]
*  But yet we live in this world where you're not supposed to talk about people [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=952.52s)]
*  being fat as being a real problem. Right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=957.7199999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to, you know, not fat chain people. It's like. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=959.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, some of that isn't. Here it is. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  I want to say, OK, SARS-CoV-2 infects fat tissue and creates [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=966.68s)]
*  inflammatory storm cloud. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=970.9599999999999s)]
*  Stanford medicine scientists find and could explain obese people [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=973.4s)]
*  have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=976.8399999999999s)]
*  and are more likely to progress to severe disease and die of infection. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=980.0400000000001s)]
*  So it shows that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human fat tissue. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=984.1600000000001s)]
*  This phenomenon was seen in laboratory experiments conducted on fat tissue [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=987.96s)]
*  excised from patients undergoing bariatric and cardiac surgeries [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=991.6s)]
*  and later infected in a laboratory dish with SARS-CoV-2. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=996.9200000000001s)]
*  It was further confirmed in autopsy samples from deceased COVID-19 patients. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1000.5200000000001s)]
*  Obesity is an established independent risk factor for SARS. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1005.32s)]
*  COVID-2 infection as well as for patients progression [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1009.32s)]
*  once infected to severe disease and death. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1012.24s)]
*  Reasons offered for this increased vulnerability range from impaired [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1015.08s)]
*  breathing, resulting from the pressure of extra weight to altered immune [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  response and responsiveness in obese people. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1022.24s)]
*  But the new study provides a more direct reason. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1024.92s)]
*  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1027.88s)]
*  can directly infect adipose tissue, which most refers to as just plain fat. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1030.92s)]
*  That in turn cooks up a cycle of viral replication within resident fat cells [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1037.44s)]
*  or adipocytes that cause profound inflammation in immune cells [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1042.84s)]
*  that hang out in fat tissue. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1049.32s)]
*  The inflammation converts even uninfected bystander cells within the tissue [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1051.08s)]
*  and into an inflammatory state with two out of every three American adults [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1056.56s)]
*  overweight and more out of four in 10 of them obese. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1060.68s)]
*  This is a potential cause for concern. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1063.8s)]
*  I feel like, well, first of all, that's wild, fucking wild. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1066.84s)]
*  But, you know, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1072.04s)]
*  I'm always amazed at those photos of like people in line for a concert in the 90s [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  or, you know, and then like [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1078.96s)]
*  juxtaposed next to something this past year, Harry Styles, I don't know. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1082.12s)]
*  And there's a distinct difference in body type. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1086.4s)]
*  And people are still eating the same junk food now that we were then. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1089.44s)]
*  Like we still ate fast food then. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1092.96s)]
*  We had all kinds of sugar and things in our diet and sweets. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1094.96s)]
*  But I'm really interested in what's in our processed food, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1099.3200000000002s)]
*  like seed oils and things like that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1104.6000000000001s)]
*  We can harp it on that ad nauseam on the podcast. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1106.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, then let's move on. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1108.88s)]
*  No, it's OK. But it's a new thing in my life. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1110.24s)]
*  So, you know, I love Ways to Well. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1112.6000000000001s)]
*  I freaking like they've been life changing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1115.48s)]
*  It's the best medical care I've ever had. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1118.8000000000002s)]
*  Like since I was a kid and I had our local doctor in Ohio, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1121.96s)]
*  like a deep blood work panel. Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1125.88s)]
*  And I've just I did a food intolerance test and I learned all these things. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1128.0s)]
*  But like canola oil was like a hugely irritating thing because I always have [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  fucking stomachaches. It's irritating for everybody. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1136.8s)]
*  Right. But it's in everything. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1139.0s)]
*  And it has all these different names. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1140.96s)]
*  But like the sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, like all that shit. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1143.24s)]
*  Like rapeseed oil is like one step away from shit we put in our cars. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1147.08s)]
*  It was it's crazy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1150.68s)]
*  Originally invented as industrial lubricants. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1152.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1154.6s)]
*  And they decided to feed it to people. Right. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1155.8799999999999s)]
*  So no, thanks. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1158.52s)]
*  You know, I'm just fascinated by that stuff because like I go through these [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1160.0s)]
*  phases where like if I just if I'm on the road or something, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1163.08s)]
*  like I'll start breaking out and like I'm getting acne, like I'm a teenager. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1167.04s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1170.2s)]
*  And it's just whatever food I'm eating. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1171.0s)]
*  My body doesn't like it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1172.96s)]
*  But recently, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1174.08s)]
*  Nick and I did carnivore for a while and oh my God, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1176.32s)]
*  I like I've never felt better. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1179.76s)]
*  Yeah, you cut out all that shit. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1181.8s)]
*  But if you cut out all that shit and then eat salads with olive oil and balsamic [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1184.0s)]
*  vinegar, you'll feel great. Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1188.56s)]
*  Like a lot of people eat salads and they think they're doing well and they pour [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1190.12s)]
*  fucking seed oil all over it. Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1192.84s)]
*  That shit's terrible for you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1194.64s)]
*  Whenever you do that. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1196.0s)]
*  I had a salad the other day and I was like, I know I'm going to hate this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1196.76s)]
*  because I know they probably put some whack ass dressing in it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1199.84s)]
*  And then after I ate it, I was like, yep, there it is. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a discomfort feeling. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1204.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I wanted a salad and I ate poison. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1206.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a bummer. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1208.68s)]
*  I don't I don't like being knocked off course. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1210.16s)]
*  I've just too much I want to do. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1212.24s)]
*  So, you know, then I was looking at like peanut butters, believe it or not, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1213.88s)]
*  Smucker's natural peanut butter is the only one I could find that had just [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  peanuts and that's it. Yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  I know you're not like peanuts aren't the best for you. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1225.0800000000002s)]
*  But, you know, I don't think they're bad for you if you don't have a peanut allergy. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  Are they bad for you? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1231.48s)]
*  There's there's better nuts. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1232.68s)]
*  But I ways too well learned. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1234.2s)]
*  A few of those are not super good for me. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1236.84s)]
*  So we don't get along. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1238.84s)]
*  Almonds you don't get along with. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1240.36s)]
*  Really? I know. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1243.0s)]
*  Supposedly, if I lay off this stuff. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1244.24s)]
*  Also, eggs was a big one for me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1246.52s)]
*  Eggs. And I was eating like five eggs every morning after the gym. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1248.12s)]
*  And but my stomach always hurts. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1252.24s)]
*  Wow. So you have an allergy to eggs. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1255.32s)]
*  It's not quite an allergy. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1257.04s)]
*  It's an intolerance. Like they have this IgG scale that they they run two or three [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1258.52s)]
*  hundred different the test I did different foods against your blood. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1263.48s)]
*  Like my blood, not just my blood type. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1266.52s)]
*  And they can show me what clashes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1268.56s)]
*  Garlic was one of them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1272.84s)]
*  And I'd rather I'd rather [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1274.04s)]
*  run my face into a wall because I'm Italian and I love that shit. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1276.68s)]
*  I was mad when I was garlic. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1280.0s)]
*  What the? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1282.44s)]
*  Come on. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1284.6s)]
*  And I was like, I won't give. I won't give. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  I'll quit. I'll quit the pastel cartel vape. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1287.32s)]
*  But I will not quit my garlic. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1289.6399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, but it's been interesting to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1292.32s)]
*  cut it all out and feel really good. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1294.76s)]
*  And but supposedly like you can you can [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1296.52s)]
*  cut it out for like three months and then maybe reintroduce it and see what happens. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1299.56s)]
*  Well, that's the elimination diet. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1303.52s)]
*  Right. That's the whole reason why carnivore works for people, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1305.32s)]
*  because you're basically breaking it down to just meat. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1308.16s)]
*  Yeah. Meats were all greens for me. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1310.44s)]
*  I had no, no problems. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1311.84s)]
*  Yeah. So I go to Hudson Meats near our house and it's all local and it's fucking [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1314.2s)]
*  delicious. All the sausage and steaks and it's just like right there in the fridge. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1320.56s)]
*  Just throw it in a pan. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1326.08s)]
*  There's a lot of cool shit in Austin when you can find like local places where like, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  yeah, this is from a farm outside of Bastrop. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1331.04s)]
*  That's where they raise their steers and it's like, oh, great. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1334.04s)]
*  You know, buy it from the people that actually made it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not getting shipped from Argentina or something. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1339.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's beautiful out there. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1341.36s)]

*  Bastrop or Argentina? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1344.32s)]
*  Bastrop. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1345.8s)]
*  Yeah, it is nice. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1348.08s)]
*  Yeah. That's the cool thing about someone. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1350.04s)]
*  Someone said something about keep Austin weird and surrounded. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1352.8s)]
*  And the idea of Austin being surrounded by real Texas, I think really weighs on [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1357.28s)]
*  Austin because there's a lot of freaks here. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1363.04s)]

*  Oh, yeah. You know, you drive around in East Austin. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1367.72s)]
*  Quite a few. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1370.52s)]
*  I don't. I'm just so amazed that people are supporting someone who's never been [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1371.2s)]
*  elected for anything. And he's silly. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1376.84s)]

*  He's like never really done the job, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1391.48s)]
*  but he's out there doing those open mics and doing it like an open mic. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1394.28s)]
*  He's like an amateur. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1398.6799999999998s)]

*  Well, what I see, I can't like speak factually on this. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1436.24s)]
*  But what I'd heard is that there were [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1440.24s)]

*  Like you got to recognize what's happening, folks. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  People are getting sick with this woke ideology, getting crammed down everybody's [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1516.1999999999998s)]
*  fucking throat. It's the worst. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1519.96s)]
*  And if you don't think that's the case, you're probably on that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1521.72s)]
*  You're on that bandwagon. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1525.28s)]
*  Yeah. You don't think there's something really wild going on. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1526.88s)]
*  What's sad is that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1530.2s)]
*  I used to really be so scared to talk about this stuff. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1533.96s)]
*  And like now I'm at this point where like I got nothing to lose. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1538.44s)]
*  I mean, like I I don't. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1542.88s)]
*  It's just like having logical conversations around this stuff. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1547.8s)]
*  Feelings are not facts. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1553.72s)]
*  Like they're just they're not. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1555.56s)]
*  And the way that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1557.84s)]
*  people are running rampant with their [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1561.2s)]
*  emotions and ruining their lives as well as others is so dangerous. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1565.32s)]
*  And I really [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1571.76s)]
*  want to be able to have conversations and also be wrong and be like [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1575.3999999999999s)]
*  scientifically told that I'm incorrect, you know, around all this stuff. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1578.9199999999998s)]
*  But it's it's so sad. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1583.56s)]
*  I mean, people are so angry and, you know, yeah, it's just social contagions and mental illness. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1585.4399999999998s)]
*  It'll be really weird if we find out this was engineered. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1593.6s)]
*  We're really weird if we find out that foreign countries have been infecting. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1596.52s)]
*  I'm sure it is. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1601.12s)]
*  I mean, like, think about it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1602.6s)]
*  Like think about how wrapped up, how easy it is to get wrapped up and not be exactly [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1604.64s)]
*  sure what thoughts are your own from looking at your fucking phone. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1609.48s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and to have a group of people [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1612.8400000000001s)]
*  that you identify with that have a very specific ideology that they support. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1615.72s)]
*  And if you're on that side, you must support that ideology. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1620.0400000000002s)]
*  Right. So when certain things come up, you just say, yes, this is what I'm supposed [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1622.3600000000001s)]
*  to say, and you haven't thought about it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1625.76s)]
*  And then quietly when people are alone, they go, I don't know about this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1627.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's a cult. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  That's a cult. It's very similar to a cult. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1633.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's very similar to a lot of, you know, mental contagions, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1636.52s)]
*  because that does happen with people that's, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1640.6s)]
*  you know, we're a fucking very strange species. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1643.28s)]
*  We're very easily influenced and malleable. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1646.4399999999998s)]
*  And we're also like very hard lined. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1648.9599999999998s)]
*  And like when we believe something, we want other people to believe it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1651.56s)]
*  We want to win that argument, win that argument that my idea is the best idea. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1654.2399999999998s)]
*  I don't feel that way. I'm not. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1659.7199999999998s)]
*  I'm not. I mean, I just want to have a good time. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1661.1999999999998s)]
*  Like I just want to like I want to give love, receive love, enjoy my life experience. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1663.2399999999998s)]
*  If there's hard conversations that need to be had, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1672.0s)]
*  I am not the most intelligent person in the room. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to learn and I'm going to listen. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, in my own personal life experience, I can speak eloquently and, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1679.12s)]
*  you know, powerfully on my own side of the street. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1686.56s)]
*  But with this stuff, like that's where I like. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1689.56s)]
*  I love reading James Lindsay and Douglas Murray and Gad Saad. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1692.12s)]
*  Like they're so brilliant and logical, critical thinking. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1696.56s)]
*  Yeah. And that's where I get like my, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1702.56s)]
*  you know, refreshing wave of confidence with this stuff. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1706.28s)]
*  Have you been paying attention to Twitter, how Twitter is now fact checking all Biden's statements? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1711.96s)]
*  Good. So every time Biden says something and posts it on Twitter, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1716.6s)]
*  Twitter's like, no, actually, that's not true. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1720.2s)]
*  Like this is this is inaccurate. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1723.3999999999999s)]
*  But they're doing it for everybody, too. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1725.52s)]
*  It's not just him. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1726.92s)]
*  Which is which is fair. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1727.96s)]
*  Let's keep it fair. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1729.0s)]
*  But what I can't cannot understand is people being like, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1730.12s)]
*  I'm leaving Twitter because [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1736.1599999999999s)]
*  without censorship, this will be the death of democracy. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1739.6s)]
*  Are you fucking serious? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1742.72s)]
*  Like, how dumb? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1744.92s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1747.56s)]
*  We are. But it's also a thing you're supposed to say. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1749.84s)]
*  I'm leaving Twitter because Elon Musk is evil. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1752.2s)]
*  And then like, yay, he said the right thing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1754.48s)]
*  Yeah. Look, having him run Twitter, I think is going to be great. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1759.08s)]
*  I think it's going to be very Twitter's funny again. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1762.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. There's like all these great jokes. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1764.76s)]
*  Yeah. You don't get him fucking banned for cracking jokes anymore. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1766.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, yeah, it's oh, boy. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1771.48s)]
*  Oh, what good fun. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1777.8799999999999s)]
*  It's just nice to have a guy who's [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1780.72s)]
*  like a tech billionaire who has an opposing perspective and is a free speech hardliner. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1783.32s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1789.24s)]
*  The fact that he, you know, literally put his money where his mouth is [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1790.56s)]
*  and purchased the biggest social media platform in the world. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1794.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Pretty fucking wild. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1797.32s)]
*  Well, there's some sort of saving grace with this like [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1799.12s)]
*  anti cancel culture thing that's happening, like, sure, fact check. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1801.84s)]
*  That's great. But give people room to fuck up. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1805.8s)]
*  Give people room to say, hey, I'm sorry, I said the wrong thing. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  And let me just apologize and I'll do better. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1811.68s)]
*  I'll try better next time. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1814.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, like very messy, you know, and depending upon who you you're a different [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1816.04s)]
*  person every day, every day, you're slightly different every day. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1820.36s)]
*  Yesterday I was Dolly Parton. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1824.12s)]
*  Are you? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1825.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1826.72s)]
*  I've downsized [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  that lady. She's one of the few people that everybody loves. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1831.44s)]
*  Oh, my God. You should get her on the podcast. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1834.2s)]
*  I would love that. That would be amazing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1836.16s)]
*  She's so loved. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  I know. Like universally loved. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1839.24s)]
*  Yeah. No matter what. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1841.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1842.44s)]
*  You know, she's like one of those people like Willie Nelson. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1843.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't hear a bad word about Willie Nelson. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1846.28s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1848.28s)]
*  Oh, God. I got to see him last year. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, no, this year I played the Luck reunion [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1852.0400000000002s)]
*  at Willie's ranch and I got to see him play. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1855.0800000000002s)]
*  And it was just I hadn't seen him like 10 years. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1859.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's just it's so special. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1861.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, he's up there. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1864.2s)]
*  So you want to get as much Willie Nelson time as you can. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1865.2s)]
*  Right. Well, you know, yeah. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1869.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, he's still playing. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1870.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's 90 now, right? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1872.0400000000002s)]
*  I think so. Maybe older. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1874.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1875.92s)]
*  He's 10 years older than Biden. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1877.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1879.64s)]
*  I guess Biden should start smoking weed. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1883.24s)]
*  I think Biden's dealing with the presidential stress, which just wears you [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1885.2s)]
*  out like 15 times more than normal stress. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  I think they're all on drugs. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1894.28s)]
*  Oh, he's definitely a drug. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  There's just oh, my God. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1897.2s)]
*  Yeah. He's got IV marks on his hands. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1899.2s)]
*  Someone was pointing that out. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1901.24s)]
*  They're giving him IVs. Sure. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1902.56s)]
*  But that's probably vitamins and stuff just to try to keep them as robust as possible. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=1904.12s)]

*  I think that's what he's got out now. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2625.32s)]
*  And then he's working on number five. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2629.4s)]
*  I think I'm due for some good fiction. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2631.36s)]
*  They're good. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2633.36s)]
*  I've been getting into all this heady stuff lately and I need to I need to calm [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2633.92s)]
*  the fuck down. That's not that heady, but it's very violent. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2637.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, it's written by an actual Navy SEAL. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2640.72s)]
*  Correct. Who really did experience combat duty. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2643.9199999999996s)]
*  And it's as close to reality as you can get in fiction in terms of like, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2646.72s)]
*  you know, obviously the good guy wins. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2652.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of reality interlaced into it in terms of like how things actually run. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2655.52s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2661.12s)]
*  Man, it's you know, Nick and I were talking about this the other day, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2663.68s)]
*  like in conjunction with Navy SEALs and highly trained operatives and, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2668.72s)]
*  you know, lethal weapons among us, like think about all the former spies [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2674.0s)]
*  that like like the the gray man like have aged out of their profession, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2680.32s)]
*  but are still among us that could like. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2685.84s)]
*  Kill you with their fingertips. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2688.68s)]
*  There's got to be a lot at this point. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2690.64s)]
*  There's probably a few hanging out your neighbor, you know, trying to have a quiet [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  life. That's that that movie or that TV show, The Old Man. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2697.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, not the great man, the old man. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2701.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what I meant. Oh, the old man. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2702.92s)]
*  Oh, I was talking about the old man. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2704.24s)]
*  Oh, the gray man was the one with the gray man is that Ryan Reynolds. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2705.64s)]
*  Ryan Gosling. I always confused those two. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2711.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. One of the men, the old man. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2714.24s)]
*  Aren't they kind of synonymous at this point? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2716.52s)]
*  Old and gray. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2718.6s)]
*  But Ryan Gosling is not old. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2720.0s)]
*  No, he's not. I was just the old man is the Jeff Bridges. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2721.52s)]
*  That's the one I was talking about. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2724.52s)]
*  That's really good for a few episodes. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2726.04s)]
*  Right. And then it's just drones on. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2727.96s)]
*  It gets to the point where you're like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2730.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. How is he getting away? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2732.84s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2734.48s)]
*  How is he driving all the way across the country? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2735.56s)]
*  And then the storyline of like dedicating his his love to this woman who's terrible [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2736.88s)]
*  to him. Well, he's terrible to her, too. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2742.2s)]
*  Yeah. But it just, you know, he dragged her and kidnapped her. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2744.6s)]
*  Once again, like a Greek tragedy. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2750.16s)]
*  Bringing it back. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2753.48s)]
*  But in the beginning, like the first episode or two, I was like, holy shit, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2754.28s)]
*  this show's great. But same. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2757.44s)]
*  We were into it for a couple of episodes and then it just. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2759.6s)]
*  Yeah, it got heavy with the dialogue where they're explaining things with dialogue. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2761.76s)]
*  Like, you're losing me here. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2765.12s)]
*  Did you guys get new writers? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2766.92s)]
*  Ran out of money. Probably. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2768.2400000000002s)]
*  It's amazing how they make shows like people get fired halfway through. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2769.88s)]
*  They bring people on. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2774.48s)]
*  They they reshoot and like jump around and executives come in. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  They want to change things. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2780.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2781.4s)]
*  That's why a lot of things get made really poorly. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2782.76s)]
*  Absolutely. Too many cooks in the kitchen. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2786.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2789.08s)]
*  I mean, there's someone else you should talk to about that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2790.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Nick would just give you the whole thing. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2794.08s)]
*  No, I'm sure he would. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2796.4s)]
*  I mean, I've gotten some of it out of him, but it's just. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2797.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's very difficult to get like one creative vision and and have that be [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2800.84s)]
*  the thing that gets put out there. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2807.12s)]
*  Well, you have to. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2808.44s)]
*  I mean, every every show, every project, every, you know, production company is [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2811.32s)]
*  different, and so like it's hard to get just like in music sometimes, like it's [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2816.96s)]
*  hard to get the right people without an ego that like just want to make something [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2821.56s)]
*  fucking awesome, but that's not the case most of the time. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2826.76s)]
*  And now, especially like our industries took. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2830.36s)]
*  I mean, what a big fat disappointment in like having to make a show. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2832.76s)]
*  But like you got to make sure you check all these political boxes so that you, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2837.52s)]
*  you know, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2842.52s)]
*  manipulate a storyline [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2844.1600000000003s)]
*  instead of just like telling a good story, like there's just all kinds of [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2846.84s)]
*  insertions of of agenda and you know, that just takes away from like watching a good [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2850.84s)]
*  movie or a good show, you know, they just feel like they have to include adversity [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2856.64s)]
*  or, you know, diversity and certain groups have to be represented. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2861.56s)]
*  And that's not what a story is supposed to be about. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2865.72s)]
*  You should have as many stories from as many different perspectives as possible. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2868.48s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you should fuck with someone's idea just because you want [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2872.04s)]
*  to add in like a gay character or a black woman character or Asian character. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2876.48s)]
*  It's like, well, it's like just natural. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2881.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like the female Ghostbusters. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2883.9199999999996s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2886.3999999999996s)]
*  Female Ghostbusters was good for a little while. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2887.52s)]
*  Yeah, like our of it or so. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2889.6s)]
*  And I'm not saying Ghostbusters can't be female. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2891.24s)]
*  The problem is they could bust the hell out of those ghosts. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2894.48s)]
*  But all the men were buffoons. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2897.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Even Bill Murray, he was bad. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2899.56s)]
*  He was a bad guy. Right. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2901.92s)]
*  You know, Bill Murray's the best. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2903.36s)]
*  They're trying to they're coming for Bill. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2905.8s)]
*  Are they? Oh, yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2907.6000000000004s)]
*  What do you mean? People saying there's all these people saying that he was [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2908.92s)]
*  horrible to work with. And I'm like, maybe they were horrible. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2911.96s)]
*  Maybe he just doesn't tolerate assholes. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2914.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. But also, like, give people some [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2916.0800000000004s)]
*  give them a chance for redemption. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2920.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, sometimes you made mistakes. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2922.2400000000002s)]
*  You got to come back and, you know, be like, yeah, maybe I was an asshole back then. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2923.76s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know either. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2928.7200000000003s)]
*  Unless unless he was like, you know, it depends on the degree. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2930.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2934.36s)]
*  People get so upset about things they probably know nothing about. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2935.4s)]
*  Everything is hearsay. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2939.5600000000004s)]
*  And that's where like this James Lindley stuff like really it blows my mind and [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2941.1200000000003s)]
*  then makes me so sad is that like objective reality is canceled out [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2946.28s)]
*  by your local narratives. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2951.96s)]
*  And like if you, you know, if I say this, this red skull is green, then it's green. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2954.88s)]
*  You know, and that's it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2961.0800000000004s)]
*  It's green or or there's some problem. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2962.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. Right. Or just like getting, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2964.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, tremendously upset about a headline [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2967.5200000000004s)]
*  because you read it and then you believe that this thing is true, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2972.76s)]
*  but you know nothing about it. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2976.48s)]
*  And it could be about Bill Murray being an asshole or whatever. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2977.88s)]
*  Like, yeah, I really care about that stuff right now. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2980.52s)]
*  I care about how it's affected my life [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2982.8s)]
*  and mistakes I've made in thought around like bandwagon emotions. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2984.6s)]
*  I'm so disappointed in myself for when I've done that. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2989.44s)]
*  Like what? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2992.36s)]
*  When like, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2993.6s)]
*  I mean, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=2995.36s)]
*  you know, a lot of the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3001.6s)]
*  the BLM stuff, you know, was so intense and so emotional. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3004.64s)]
*  And [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  like I read Tahenasi Coats's book Between the World and Me. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3013.3199999999997s)]
*  And then I read Douglas Murray, who gives you a totally different context on [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3018.4s)]
*  Coats's version of the world, which is is really harsh and [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3025.56s)]
*  you know, shaming. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3032.2s)]
*  For a white person, you know, and I, I do care. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3034.48s)]
*  I do care about justice. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3039.7999999999997s)]
*  I do care about reality and actual problems. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3041.12s)]
*  But I think that like the way the narrative around racism now is so [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  destructive and show me where I'm wrong, by the way, you know, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3049.8799999999997s)]
*  like show me where I'm saying the wrong things and I've made a mistake. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3053.8399999999997s)]
*  But, you know, like diversity and inclusion officers in the schools [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3057.08s)]
*  teaching kids about white privilege and things like that. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3063.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, it just seems so destructive. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3067.44s)]
*  Like now we're so aware of each other's differences in skin color, whereas like [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3070.52s)]
*  I, I just care about if you're a good person or not. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3075.84s)]
*  You know, I just care about what kind of people we are. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3078.6s)]
*  And this is where like, you know, I'm not I'm not trying to start a fight [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3081.96s)]
*  with anybody, like I want to understand what is real and what has been [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3087.32s)]
*  a narrative that's pushed on me to manipulate my emotions. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3092.0s)]
*  And [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3096.0s)]
*  push me to make choices that I don't understand. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3097.92s)]
*  Well, the wildest thing about the BLM thing is there's always overcorrections, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3101.0s)]
*  right? There's always like things that we recognize are giant problems in this [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3105.0s)]
*  country and racism certainly is one. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3109.76s)]
*  And then things go so far to one direction and then they bounce back the other [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3112.92s)]
*  direction. The problem with that is like you don't want it bouncing back into the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3118.2400000000002s)]
*  area of accepting racism. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3122.44s)]
*  You don't ever want to be pushed in so so far to one way that it becomes popular to [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3124.08s)]
*  bounce back. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3129.92s)]
*  No, what I care about are things that are called racist that aren't shouldn't be [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3130.7200000000003s)]
*  like like math. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3135.04s)]
*  Right. Like I'm talking about that stuff, that kind of shit. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3136.92s)]
*  And like where it's become maniacal. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3140.2000000000003s)]
*  The problem is it also becomes something that people barter in. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3143.4s)]
*  You know, you whenever you have an issue, that's a cultural issue, you can have [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3147.04s)]
*  people that are essentially mercenaries that use whatever that cultural issue is [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3151.36s)]
*  to for their own personal gain. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3156.28s)]
*  For their own. And, you know, yeah, that's one of the things that people saw with BLM [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3158.44s)]
*  was where all the money went. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, that too. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3163.92s)]
*  Where did it go? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3166.36s)]
*  A lot of it's missing. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3167.32s)]
*  A lot of it was spent on houses for the people that, you know, were a part of the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3168.4s)]
*  movement that now live in mansions. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  Originally, what was it supposed to be for? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3173.76s)]
*  Community oriented things. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3176.1600000000003s)]
*  But the problem is whenever you have any sort of charitable organization, you have [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3178.2s)]
*  people that are actually being paid by the organization and like how much should they [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3182.08s)]
*  make and then like where is that money going? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3186.3999999999996s)]
*  How is that money being allocated? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3188.64s)]
*  Who gets to decide if you donate a million dollars to an organization and that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3190.2799999999997s)]
*  organization has a million dollars? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3194.3199999999997s)]
*  Do they have a mandate very specifically as to where they can apply that money and [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3195.3999999999996s)]
*  not? And it turns out in some cases, no. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3199.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. And people were donating because they thought it was a good cause and the [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3201.56s)]
*  right thing to do. And it made them feel better to donate. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3204.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3206.68s)]
*  That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3207.84s)]
*  I did those things and I didn't understand them other than I just felt so bad. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3209.76s)]
*  Right. You know, and [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3214.1600000000003s)]
*  and I. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3217.48s)]
*  That's where I wanted to take control of of my life in that way, of of just like, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3219.6400000000003s)]
*  I want to know what's going on, I want to know what I believe in, I want to know [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3225.04s)]
*  what's real and I want to read and have my own life experiences and talk to people [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3228.48s)]
*  if they want to share something with me so I can understand your your perspective. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3233.52s)]
*  You know, like I'm I'm big on meritocracy, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3238.4s)]
*  you know, like I work hard, I know people that work really hard and and get to the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3243.44s)]
*  places they want to be in life or keep trying to get to the place they want to be [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3248.68s)]
*  in life, whether it's your career or being a good person or being a good, you know, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3251.92s)]
*  mother, father, husband, wife. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3257.16s)]
*  But, you know, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3258.92s)]
*  to say like you have an advantage because you're a man and I have a disadvantage [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3261.52s)]
*  because I'm a woman is bullshit. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3265.64s)]
*  I mean, like I get where sometimes that that would make sense. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3268.96s)]
*  Like if we were talking UFC, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3272.56s)]
*  but like that kind of stuff, like. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3277.4s)]
*  Like I've been the only woman on a bill more times I could ever count. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3281.68s)]
*  Like I that's just like been in the way for a while. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3285.56s)]
*  And then you start seeing more female artists and they're really, really good. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3291.2s)]
*  But I don't think they were given that position because they're women. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3295.64s)]
*  I think they were given the spot on the bill because their music is awesome. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3298.68s)]
*  That's the same with comedy. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3301.92s)]
*  Right. I think it's actually harder for women to do comedy. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3303.12s)]
*  Absolutely. It's like because the the. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3305.8399999999997s)]
*  Evidence is that no one's laughing if you're not funny, you know. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3310.72s)]
*  Well, I think it's harder for women because there's a lot of men that don't [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3315.08s)]
*  want to see women be the person that talks. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3317.7599999999998s)]
*  Like when a woman goes on stage and she's [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3320.3199999999997s)]
*  commanding all the attention, a lot of men are fucking to do that. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3322.2s)]
*  I should be doing that. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3325.48s)]
*  Women aren't funny. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3326.4399999999996s)]
*  Like there's a prejudice about women. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3327.3199999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah, sure. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3328.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely is. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3330.72s)]
*  There's a prejudice amongst men that some women aren't funny. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3331.8799999999997s)]
*  Huh? Yeah. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3335.68s)]
*  And then it's like, what what do they talk about? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3337.12s)]
*  Look, if a woman's on stage talking about politics, good luck. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3339.4399999999996s)]
*  It's hard enough for a man to talk about the politics. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3342.68s)]
*  But when women talk about politics, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3344.8399999999997s)]
*  again, there's a certain percentage of the male population in particular that [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3346.56s)]
*  don't want to fucking hear it. Right. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3349.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, you want to change the subject? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I just think it's it's a more difficult role, but a lot of women make it. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3356.44s)]
*  And, you know, those women are very popular. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3361.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's comedy is a meritocracy in that if you are funny, you will. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3363.48s)]
*  And it gets out there and people get to see it. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3367.6s)]
*  They will come see you. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3369.92s)]
*  Yeah. If you keep working on it and you [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3370.88s)]
*  keep writing new stuff and keep putting out specials, you will have a career. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3372.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3376.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that don't have a career and they attribute that to [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3377.12s)]
*  sexism in some way. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3380.6s)]
*  And, you know, I go, did you do everything you could? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3381.64s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3384.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, did you did you improve? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3385.12s)]
*  Did you write a lot? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3387.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you work on your act? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3388.28s)]
*  Were you self critical? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3389.64s)]
*  Were you objective? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3391.28s)]
*  Did you analyze your material and rework it and hone it down to a razor's edge? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3392.36s)]
*  You probably didn't. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3398.04s)]
*  You're probably mad and you're probably [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3399.36s)]
*  trying to attribute all sorts of external reasons as to why you're not as [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3401.04s)]
*  successful as other people. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3404.6800000000003s)]
*  That's like that's the point. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3406.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3407.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3408.2400000000002s)]
*  There's always going to be that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3408.96s)]
*  But then there's always going to be people who rise. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3410.2000000000003s)]
*  And most people will look at those people that do rise and see, especially if those [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3412.12s)]
*  people are very dedicated and they worked hard. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3416.4s)]
*  Well, there's obviously a merit to that. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3418.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3420.48s)]
*  Well, these are the standards I have for myself. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3421.0s)]
*  Like I the way I see the world is like [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3423.04s)]
*  I can't make excuses for my shortcomings or my [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3426.92s)]
*  inabilities or failures and say it's someone else's fault. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3432.7599999999998s)]
*  People love to do that. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3435.72s)]
*  I know it's a fucking sport. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3436.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3439.44s)]
*  Well, that's that's where you pretty much lose me. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3439.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3442.44s)]
*  It's just you're wasting so much time, too. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3442.7999999999997s)]
*  And it doesn't work. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3444.8399999999997s)]
*  First of all, people don't believe it when you blame other people for your lack [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3446.08s)]
*  of success. Other people don't believe it. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3449.44s)]
*  They let you talk, but they don't believe it. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3451.2799999999997s)]
*  And they don't respect you because they know that you're looking for excuses. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3453.04s)]
*  And they'll listen and they may even agree with you like, yeah, yeah, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3456.12s)]
*  you're getting fucked over. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3459.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3460.48s)]
*  But really, you know, it's how you behave, what you do, how you think, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3461.12s)]
*  how you go about doing things, whether or not you can work. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3465.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3468.0s)]
*  Well, the work part is the hardest part. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3468.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3470.56s)]
*  So many people find excuses for not getting things done. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3471.0s)]
*  It's like you just got to work. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3473.44s)]
*  I mean, I like truth be told, like I'm giving my career a whole makeover [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3475.16s)]
*  because like it hasn't been working like the since covid especially. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3480.16s)]
*  But like, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3484.96s)]
*  I just not making enough money on the road. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3487.16s)]
*  And like, and I do feel like it's my fault. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3488.8799999999997s)]
*  So a lot of factors. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3492.9199999999996s)]
*  But like with that said, like I had those feelings of. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3494.68s)]
*  Like a lot of sadness around it for a little while and just like defeat. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3501.68s)]
*  And I felt really sorry for myself. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  And then I I've been learning logic, which is a recording production program. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3507.16s)]
*  And it's so fun and I love it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3512.9199999999996s)]
*  And I'm getting better and better at it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3515.64s)]
*  And just finding like reempowering myself with the things I can control. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3517.8s)]
*  But the things like like filling a room and across the country. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3522.84s)]
*  And I'm in the like torso part of the music industry, like [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3527.2400000000002s)]
*  club area where I could I could do OK, like if it were like the old days where [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3531.84s)]
*  like people were always coming out, but for some reason the last year, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3537.0s)]
*  they just weren't not for me. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3541.36s)]
*  And, you know, that like maybe my music wasn't good enough. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3543.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. Like it's hard to get the word out there these days for some reason. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3547.16s)]
*  But either way, like [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3552.24s)]
*  I did those things like I was mad and I was like, well, it's this it's because of this [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3554.08s)]
*  and because of this and because of this. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3557.8799999999997s)]
*  And I guess at the end of the day, none of that matters [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3559.24s)]
*  because I'm just like so pumped to play music no matter where I am at this point. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3563.52s)]
*  Like it's kind of that contemplate your death feeling of just like, well, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3567.2s)]
*  I'm having fun wherever I'm at and I've had a lot of fun thus far. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3571.8799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, the thing that I want, like. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3577.04s)]
*  Like, I think I have it, I think I already have it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  And if it if like my music explodes into the universe, great. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3585.6s)]
*  And if I just keep getting to do what I'm doing, like, that's great, too. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3590.32s)]
*  But. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3594.08s)]
*  You know, performing is is kind of like. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3596.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3601.52s)]
*  Performing and seeing live performances [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3603.56s)]
*  feels essential to me, you know, you know, like, you need to go out there and do your thing. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3605.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, once you experience it and experience [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3611.6s)]
*  that sort of transcendent moment of the whole crowd vibing with a song, enjoying it, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3614.92s)]
*  it's like those are beautiful moments in life. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3620.4s)]
*  And the people that don't get to see them, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3622.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe they forget or maybe they haven't experienced it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3625.12s)]
*  But it enhances your life in a very unique way. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3628.24s)]
*  And musicians like yourself and and so many others, they provide a thing that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3630.88s)]
*  if you guys didn't provide it, the world would be less fun. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3637.96s)]
*  It'd be less exciting. It'd be less cool. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3640.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It's beautiful. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3643.2000000000003s)]
*  I hope I didn't contradict myself by being like, I'm making excuses. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3644.44s)]
*  You're looking at life and you're trying to figure yourself out. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3648.04s)]
*  Well, it's you know, I think the difficult thing is like. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3650.96s)]
*  I know myself, I know who I am, and [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3655.0s)]
*  when you feel limited with your extension of your abilities or yourself, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3658.8399999999997s)]
*  it's a very confusing thing, you know, because I'm not sure what what is my fault [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3664.8799999999997s)]
*  and what is just the circumstance in the state of my industry or, you know, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3668.92s)]
*  because it's such a moving target, it's always changing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3674.48s)]
*  And like, you know, Jamie and I were talking earlier about TikTok. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3677.8799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, you know, it's like, OK, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3680.8399999999997s)]
*  so you got to write the songs and you got to record them and make them fucking [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3682.7599999999998s)]
*  awesome. And then you got to make sure you're doing TikTok and like all like [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3686.24s)]
*  keeping up on the stuff you're talking. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3689.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, I have an account. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3692.3599999999997s)]
*  I usually post like videos of my dogs and because they're hilarious. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3694.2s)]
*  But I'll put some music on there from time to time. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3698.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't like feeling like I have to do it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3701.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's just it's like another like, OK, fine. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3703.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, the reluctant it feels desperate. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3707.96s)]
*  I think what I don't like about those things is like, I want to come by those [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3710.8399999999997s)]
*  honestly, like if I really feel like there's something funny I want to share. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3714.08s)]
*  It's great because it's natural. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3717.92s)]
*  But I also don't like seeing all of the desperation on there. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3719.96s)]
*  Like somebody caught a wave and then they keep trying to recreate that wave over [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3724.4s)]
*  and over and it's like, oh, man, that's that's what you got, huh? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3728.52s)]
*  You got that one video with the goat and you keep posting the goat videos. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3731.96s)]
*  Goats are funny. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3735.56s)]
*  But what else you got? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3736.92s)]
*  You know, like that that's sort of where I feel a little disheartened by that stuff. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3738.56s)]
*  Well, it's it's the good aspect of no one curating things. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3743.48s)]
*  The good aspect of not having executives in charge is that people fuck up and they [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3748.0800000000004s)]
*  don't they do things that aren't entertaining or they're needy or whatever. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3752.0s)]
*  But that's just, yeah, part of the thing. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3756.6400000000003s)]
*  Some people are awesome at it. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3759.04s)]
*  Some people just have a brain. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3760.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So well suited to performing in social media. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3761.8s)]
*  Right. Right. And I and I love those accounts, you know. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3765.6800000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's the upside. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3768.52s)]
*  And and just sometimes like, you know, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3771.24s)]
*  like the things you're into, like falconry, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3774.96s)]
*  you just follow all that shit. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3779.04s)]
*  I think the most amazing owls with a lot of artists, there's the the you want to [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3780.6s)]
*  create, but then you want to be recognized for your creations. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3785.44s)]
*  And then you try to figure out how do I get recognized more and what do I have to [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3788.52s)]
*  do? And then you have to do things you don't want to do, like social media. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3791.64s)]
*  So I had a I had a show in Chicago a couple of months ago, September. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3795.44s)]
*  Yeah. And Chicago used to be a really big market for me and honey, honey. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3800.6s)]
*  We used to just crush it. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3805.52s)]
*  And like what's happening now is so like you get you get the word out about your [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3807.44s)]
*  shows through social media or radio, if that's whoever listens to the radio. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3815.24s)]
*  And then the promoters that are promoting the show are using the same tools that you [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3820.6s)]
*  are. And so I went to like you have to pay to boost your posts on Instagram. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3824.44s)]
*  But you also have to be approved before you pay for the boost. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3830.04s)]
*  So I had like a flyer about my show in Chicago. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3834.2s)]
*  And I got denied to boost it, to target the area. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3837.72s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3842.6s)]
*  So I couldn't like like you post any covid stuff. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3843.92s)]
*  No, I hadn't. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3848.48s)]
*  I hadn't in a while. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3850.24s)]
*  But you might have maybe like you might have got put on a list. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3852.12s)]
*  I stopped talking about shit like I like this is probably where I'm going to get [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3854.48s)]
*  in trouble because I've been like, but I know it wasn't anything like that. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3857.72s)]
*  And you did before. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3863.52s)]
*  I think I posted one thing that was I can't remember, but it was like a logical [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3866.2799999999997s)]
*  thing about the vaccine of like, well, if I can still get covid and spread covid, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3870.24s)]
*  why do I need the vaccine? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3874.8399999999997s)]
*  I think that's all you need to do to get really list. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3876.16s)]
*  But there's but there's other other cities where I've been able to target and [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3878.48s)]
*  boost my posts. For some reason, it just wouldn't let me. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3882.04s)]
*  Maybe it's Lori Lightfoot. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3884.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe she's blocked you from promoting. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3885.64s)]
*  Anyway, like it was just yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3889.2s)]
*  You know what? You're probably right. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3891.12s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck the behind the scenes stuff is. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3893.6s)]
*  Like Elon posted on Twitter that people that have had their accounts removed and [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3898.4s)]
*  they're trying to get them back, they're not going to be able to do it for a while [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3902.8s)]
*  because they're going through the code and they're trying to figure they brought [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3905.16s)]
*  in a bunch of Tesla engineers to like go over the code. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3909.28s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3912.2s)]
*  We're bringing in rocket scientists to fix Twitter. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3913.3999999999996s)]
*  But apparently during this time, the content moderation really hasn't changed. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3916.3999999999996s)]
*  It's the same sort of algorithm that are in control of content and posts. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3920.16s)]
*  And so a lot of people go out. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3924.3199999999997s)]
*  Everything's different since you on came on board. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3925.64s)]
*  So he made a post like nothing has changed. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3927.8799999999997s)]
*  We haven't changed anything about content moderation. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3930.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't have the same people behind the scenes that they fired everybody. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3933.04s)]
*  I saw that. Did you did you hear about the two guys that like trolled? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3937.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3942.04s)]
*  So brilliant. Like that's the kind of that's the kind of, you know, tick tock shit. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to see like really, really innovative employees. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3948.1200000000003s)]
*  I got to get home to my husband and my wife. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3951.44s)]
*  No, but it was like they had some sort of name that was like a hey, would you blow [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3956.44s)]
*  me or something like they put their names together and it was it was something like [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3960.2400000000002s)]
*  that. Like, yeah, I love that shit. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3963.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, it's just a good time to goof on people. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3967.32s)]
*  It is so many people are so goddamn serious and stupid. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3970.08s)]
*  Well. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3973.92s)]
*  Here we are. Here we are being serious and stupid. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3975.92s)]
*  Yeah, we're not contributing. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3978.4s)]
*  We're just we're just droning on and on with the same. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3980.0s)]
*  But that's life. Yeah, that's good, though. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3983.36s)]
*  And it's simplest form, like the littlest thing. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3986.64s)]
*  When you said you like retooled your career, like what did you do? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3989.04s)]
*  I'm retooling it now. What are you doing? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3992.12s)]
*  Well, I'm making new music and [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3994.52s)]
*  taking more control from the actual recording side of things. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=3999.4s)]
*  So I don't need to depend on other people to make music like I can do it on my own. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4003.52s)]
*  Did you and Gary record Midnight Rider? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4007.92s)]
*  So I well, yes, but no, I recorded the track with Elijah Ford and J.J. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4010.2400000000002s)]
*  Johnson, his drummer and bass player who are fucking awesome. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4016.28s)]
*  And, you know, Gary's working on his record right now. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4019.28s)]
*  So I don't want to bother him too much, but we like made a track, which is awesome. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4022.12s)]
*  I could I could play you what we have, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4027.2s)]
*  but I really just want to send it to you like in its full form. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4028.56s)]
*  But Gary really likes it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4031.84s)]
*  So he's just going to, you know, add his stuff to it, which is going to be epic. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4033.92s)]
*  And, you know, no pressure, Gary, but we've talked about it in public now. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4039.68s)]
*  Well, when you guys did that that one night that we went out, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4045.64s)]
*  it was who put together that party, some liquor company, Jameson, Jameson. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4049.32s)]
*  Yeah. So we went out. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4053.56s)]
*  It was like, was like a Monday or a Tuesday in downtown L.A. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4054.76s)]
*  like midnight in this small place. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4058.0800000000004s)]
*  And you guys and Gary on stage and you're singing the lyrics off your phone [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4061.48s)]
*  because you don't know the lyrics. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4067.28s)]
*  You know that. Well, I know the first I knew the first verse and then the other. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4068.84s)]
*  Yeah. Anyway, I got the fact that well, the people thought you were [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4071.76s)]
*  really reading your text messages. Who the fuck would do that? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4074.44s)]
*  That's so dumb. Yeah. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4077.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, who the fuck would sing a song that they literally haven't practiced ever [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4078.28s)]
*  and then do it that way? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4083.16s)]
*  You guys did. But it was amazing. It was such a great version. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4084.8799999999997s)]
*  It was fun. And Gary's sound is so distinctive. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4088.64s)]
*  Like you hear a riff and you're like, oh, that's Gary Clark Jr. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4092.68s)]
*  He's the best. And he's such a great dude. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4095.48s)]
*  Yeah, I love Gary. I love watching him play. He's a magic person. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4098.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's very special. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4101.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's people that are just magic. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4102.76s)]
*  They just have a thing and it just works. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4104.48s)]
*  And he's so cool. Yeah. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4106.44s)]
*  And so calm and so fucking talented. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4108.12s)]
*  And when he starts playing that sound is it's just amazing to me [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4111.04s)]
*  that someone can take a guitar and so many people play guitar. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4115.64s)]
*  But when he plays the guitar, it's him. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4119.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's his sounds coming through that guitar. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4121.12s)]
*  And you can tell almost immediately. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4123.96s)]
*  But also, like his voice is incredible. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4126.12s)]
*  It is beautiful. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4129.88s)]
*  And he can sing so in so many different ways. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4131.64s)]
*  Like it's I did a couple shows with him last year and it was just [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4136.16s)]
*  I loved watching him play and the whole band. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4140.48s)]
*  Like he's got a great band like they all just [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4142.759999999999s)]
*  the whole thing is is put together so well. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4145.88s)]
*  And it's really fun to watch. Yeah. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4148.48s)]
*  No, it's exciting. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4152.04s)]
*  And it's exciting that he's here. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4153.28s)]
*  You know, he's his hometown. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4155.44s)]
*  I remember talking to him before the covid thing when he moved back. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4158.719999999999s)]
*  He moved back before covid. He moved here. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4162.2s)]
*  He's like, man, I just can't do it from L.A. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4164.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they've been back for a while. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4166.36s)]
*  I think. Yeah. I just can't do this place anymore. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4167.96s)]
*  Same. It got dark. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4170.4s)]
*  Like like once again, Joe, thanks for encouraging me to move to Austin, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4173.52s)]
*  because my whole life changed in in so many incredible ways. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4178.52s)]
*  But I didn't know how bad L.A. was until I left. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4184.04s)]
*  And I mean, it was getting bad when I was there. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4187.72s)]
*  Like I was chasing people out of my yard. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4189.44s)]
*  Like I lived in Silver Lake and it was just dangerous. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4191.84s)]
*  And then just on top of that, like this collective angst [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4196.92s)]
*  that you just couldn't you could not get away from. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4200.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The collective angst was the scariest thing to me [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4203.5199999999995s)]
*  because it's like so many people had adopted it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4205.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it seemed like the tone. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4208.0s)]
*  That's the weird thing about traveling is you get to see the tone of a city. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4210.0s)]
*  Like Tom Segura was just talking about Toronto [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4213.44s)]
*  and that he was in Toronto a few months back where people still had to wear [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4216.08s)]
*  fucking masks. It's crazy. Still. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4218.719999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. They had a mask mandate. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4220.839999999999s)]
*  He's like, this is insane. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4222.5199999999995s)]
*  And then he went back to Toronto after the mask mandate. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4223.639999999999s)]
*  And he's like, you could feel like this is like lifted something off of people. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4226.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, when you moved here, like wasn't Austin [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4231.5199999999995s)]
*  only locked down for like three months and then they were just back up and running. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4234.759999999999s)]
*  And yeah, pretty quickly. Yeah. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4238.28s)]
*  Yeah. It's just a more logical approach. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4240.759999999999s)]
*  And the problem is there was so much pushback against that logical approach. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4243.679999999999s)]
*  That was incorrect. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4246.96s)]
*  So many people were saying, you're going to kill us all. Right. Right. Not true. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4248.48s)]
*  Well, that was that, you know, maneuver to when I moved here was like me [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4251.759999999999s)]
*  trying to regain my own like, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4255.32s)]
*  you know, intellectual integrity. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4260.44s)]
*  I was like, what are like what thoughts are my own like in L.A. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4262.5599999999995s)]
*  Like every it's such an echo chamber of like flagrant emotions [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4265.5199999999995s)]
*  and angst, like we said. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4270.12s)]
*  And so like I just like, I mean, I didn't realize it until I left. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4272.12s)]
*  Like I was just suffocated. Mm hmm. And [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4275.92s)]
*  even even creatively, I didn't write the whole year of covid. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4280.36s)]
*  I didn't write one song, which is like I write all the time. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4284.48s)]
*  I love to write. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4286.919999999999s)]
*  Honestly. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4288.959999999999s)]
*  I like really worked on myself, like I meditated and was like [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4291.36s)]
*  reading all the books and, you know, having my, you know, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4295.679999999999s)]
*  dark nights of the soul and I really was like, it was it was hardcore. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4299.2s)]
*  Like I was I was in a very low place, very, very low. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4303.759999999999s)]
*  And for like in the best way, because I just [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4307.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, like I was there for almost 20 years. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4312.36s)]
*  I was there for. 18 years, say for two years in Nashville. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4314.12s)]
*  And I mean, you know, I I came here to visit you and see you guys perform at Stubbs. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4320.24s)]
*  And then I was like, I really like this place and [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4327.5599999999995s)]
*  and I expected to be lonely for a while, like I really thought like [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4331.16s)]
*  it would be like when I moved to L.A., like I didn't have good friends [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4334.84s)]
*  for like two years, like I didn't find my friends, the kind of people I like, you know. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4337.5599999999995s)]
*  And it like just from the jump, I was just making all these friends. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4342.52s)]
*  And then I met Nick three weeks here and it was just it was beautiful. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4345.84s)]
*  I I was like, freedom. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4351.36s)]
*  I just got to live again in a way that is very natural to my person. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4355.2s)]
*  And, you know, just the things I'm into. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4360.96s)]
*  Well, we're just very lucky that there's a place like this that exists. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4364.0s)]
*  You could go that was different. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4366.72s)]
*  Yeah. That people weren't captured with that fucking angst that L.A. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4368.24s)]
*  I mean, you still have it here, but it's it's not it's in these little pockets. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4373.48s)]
*  It's cute. It's cute. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4377.04s)]
*  You walk on the street with a mask. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4378.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4379.48s)]
*  I was at a grocery store in a neighborhood the other day, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4381.08s)]
*  and there was like 10 people with masks on in the store. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4384.2s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck's going on here? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4387.28s)]
*  It's the Democrats' MAGA hat. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4390.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4392.679999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4394.28s)]
*  They're letting you know. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4395.84s)]
*  I'm on the good team. Oh, my God. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4397.68s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4399.360000000001s)]
*  And they don't want to take it off because it's an identity point. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4400.0s)]
*  The thing is, I have empathy for people, people's fear. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4403.04s)]
*  Like, I almost want to be like, it's going to be OK. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4407.6s)]
*  You know, like I want to hug them. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4410.200000000001s)]
*  Be like, hey, you're going to be fine. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4411.96s)]
*  But it's not just their fear. It's an identity. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4413.84s)]
*  It's a flag. Yeah, of course. Yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4416.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They're wearing a flag on their face. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4418.360000000001s)]
*  But I've also had like a ton of people wear their masks [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4420.84s)]
*  and be totally fine talking to me, like not offended. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4424.160000000001s)]
*  You know, that that part's always funny to me. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4426.759999999999s)]
*  Like if you have a mask on and they're like giving you the [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4429.799999999999s)]
*  the look of like, why aren't you wearing one? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4433.12s)]
*  Well, if you have one, then you should be fine. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4435.16s)]
*  Well, it's also it's like at this point, what the fuck? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4437.96s)]
*  Are you not listening at all? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4440.5599999999995s)]
*  You're not reading anything. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4441.96s)]
*  You're not paying attention at all. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4443.48s)]
*  You know, I mean, one of the reasons why I got really into fiction recently [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4445.799999999999s)]
*  and I've been reading all these [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4449.24s)]
*  gray man books and all these fiction books is because it's escapism. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4451.28s)]
*  Yeah, of course. The nonfiction I was reading was fucking terrifying. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4455.5199999999995s)]
*  I got deep into that. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4459.24s)]
*  The real Anthony Fauci book. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4460.4s)]
*  I was like, I got to put this fucking thing down. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4461.839999999999s)]
*  Nick and I talked about it when we went to that dinner with Jordan Peterson. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4464.4s)]
*  And I started getting into it. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4467.879999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. Yeah. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4468.959999999999s)]
*  And undeniable facts. This is this is not like that. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4471.839999999999s)]
*  You got to take breaks from that. Yeah. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4475.36s)]
*  That book is long as fuck and filled with horrific details. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4477.36s)]
*  Yes. Yes, it is. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4480.879999999999s)]
*  But but listen, I don't think nonfiction is just escapism. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4481.799999999999s)]
*  Like nonfiction reinvigorates your vocabulary, your own creativity. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4484.8s)]
*  It it gives you a boost of a story, you know. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4490.68s)]
*  And I actually use that as like if I'm really depressed [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4495.96s)]
*  or I'm super anxious and I can't hold a thought, I make I set a timer [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4500.320000000001s)]
*  and I make myself read a book for like 20 minutes. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4504.88s)]
*  And I mean, it's almost instant that I snap out of whatever funk I was in. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4508.52s)]
*  But it's very grounding. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4514.32s)]
*  It's not a device. It's not an electronic device. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4515.72s)]
*  And I just I just love to learn, even if it's a fictional story. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4519.04s)]
*  I think it's very healthy. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4524.56s)]
*  Well, it's good to absorb other people's ideas. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4526.28s)]
*  It's good to absorb other people's writing, their work, you know. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4528.8s)]
*  And you get part of their perspective through their work, too. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4532.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not just the facts. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4536.88s)]
*  You know, I'd like both. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4538.6s)]
*  I like fiction just for just like I don't want to think about reality. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4539.92s)]
*  I just want to like get carried away by a story. Right. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4543.68s)]
*  But I also like nonfiction. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4546.04s)]
*  It's just like the problem was that the nonfiction I was leaning into was all just [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4547.8s)]
*  it just filled me with dismay, sure. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4552.84s)]
*  And anger. And yeah, you got to balance it out. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4555.4400000000005s)]
*  That book is frustrating. It's tough. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4557.96s)]
*  The real Anthony Fauci is frustrating. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4559.64s)]
*  I actually haven't finished it because I was starting to get really depressed. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4560.8s)]
*  It's fucking depressing. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4564.200000000001s)]
*  When they get to the part where they were experimenting with HIV [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4565.56s)]
*  vaccines on foster kids. Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4568.240000000001s)]
*  What the fuck? Yeah. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4571.04s)]
*  And yeah, it's airtight. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4572.84s)]
*  It's all airtight. You can't dispute it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4574.4800000000005s)]
*  It's irrefutable. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4577.360000000001s)]
*  That's the problem is people want to paint Robert Kennedy, Jr. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4577.96s)]
*  as a conspiracy theorist. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4581.8s)]
*  Like you go ahead and do that. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4583.08s)]
*  But there's a reason why he's not getting sued for that book. Yeah. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4584.6s)]
*  It's because they have all of the citations. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4587.320000000001s)]
*  And it's all and it's not even politics. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4590.76s)]
*  It's he's a lifelong Democrat. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4592.8s)]
*  Like there's no like two ways around that book. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  It's it's tough. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4596.92s)]
*  But again, like, you know, there's that [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4598.28s)]
*  like anybody like could could just you could just lose yourself [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4601.76s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4604.76s)]
*  And it's like this balance of like, I want to know about that stuff, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4605.64s)]
*  but I also don't want to like lose my fucking mind, you know, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4608.68s)]
*  because because you can't. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4612.0s)]
*  It's so dark. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4613.24s)]
*  Do a lot of people go from that to the next one, to the next one, to the next one. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4614.0s)]
*  And if you just only look for corruption [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4618.24s)]
*  and just horrible abuses of power, there's so many examples of it. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4621.68s)]
*  And you could you could really think that this is affecting your life more. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4626.84s)]
*  Even so than it is, because it's your primary focus. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4630.5599999999995s)]

*  Norse gods. I read American gods, Neil Gaiman's book that they made a TV show about it. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4641.92s)]
*  But it's really it's really actually, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4647.24s)]
*  you know, kind of ironic because it's about the old gods versus the new gods. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4651.679999999999s)]
*  And the new gods are like the god of TV and the gods of cell phones and like, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4656.96s)]
*  you know, technology. What is it? What is the it's I mean, it's a fictional book about [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4660.76s)]
*  gods living among us. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4666.2s)]

*  Chevrolet, like, no, no. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4676.72s)]
*  I mean, it's like they use actual like gods. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4679.36s)]
*  Yeah. Norse gods like Odin and stuff like that. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4682.6s)]
*  Yeah. But they see Odin, they give him they give him another name. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4685.08s)]
*  But it's really like. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4691.16s)]

*  own words, which is [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4709.4800000000005s)]

*  OK, that's a different kind of puzzle, right? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4822.400000000001s)]
*  That's what she's saying to like all blue, like they'll know it's [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4824.2s)]

*  Basically, they cut on the exact same. Oh, my God. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4830.04s)]
*  So it's like impossible to figure out. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4832.12s)]
*  Oh, no, that that would break my brain. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4833.48s)]

*  The jigsaw stuff, it's meditative. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4839.4s)]
*  And, you know, you can also like listen to a podcast and do it. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4841.599999999999s)]
*  Like there's something about [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4845.24s)]
*  there's some sort of reward in putting it together [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4847.679999999999s)]
*  when it's a mess and organizing it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4851.16s)]
*  And, you know, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4853.0s)]

*  Like it's supposed to be an exercise. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4868.64s)]
*  But I was like, when we get another puzzle, I fucking love this shit. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4869.76s)]
*  When you write, like if you write music, do you have like [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4872.68s)]
*  a process that you go through? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4876.24s)]
*  Do you just have a thought in your head when you're writing a song? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4878.12s)]
*  Do you sit aside and say, like, I'm going to write from 9 a.m. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4880.92s)]
*  to 11 a.m. Like, how do you do it? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4884.76s)]
*  Both of those things. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4886.84s)]
*  The more you stick to a schedule and like [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4888.84s)]
*  keep chipping away at a song, the better and better it gets. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4892.92s)]
*  And then the easier it gets. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4896.24s)]
*  Like if I'm actively [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4897.8s)]
*  working on lyrics as well as instrumental, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4902.56s)]
*  it all starts to like piece together. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4906.32s)]
*  And sometimes old ideas from years ago that I've saved, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4908.76s)]
*  I'll like Frankenstein a song together and it'll make sense. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4912.24s)]
*  Kind of like a fucking puzzle. Yeah. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4914.96s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4918.16s)]
*  Do we just have a eureka moment? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4919.52s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean, the process is just to keep doing it, you know. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4921.6s)]
*  And sometimes I'll get the lyrics for a song I was working on [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4927.400000000001s)]
*  when I'm driving in my car and I have to, you know, voice record them. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4930.92s)]
*  Because it it can also be kind of haunting [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4936.0s)]
*  because I'll have it stuck in my head [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4938.76s)]
*  like a song I'm working on and. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4942.72s)]
*  And then like I'll be like half awake in the morning [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4945.32s)]
*  and it'll I'll be like singing it in my head. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4948.56s)]
*  And it feels like until it's done, just like this puzzle. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4950.92s)]
*  Oh, my God. Like I can't. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4954.04s)]
*  It's like in the back of my mind, like it has to be finished. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4955.48s)]
*  Like you have to keep going. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4957.76s)]
*  Like you have to finish that. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4958.88s)]
*  So it'll keep me up at night sometimes. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4961.28s)]
*  But. Yeah, it's it's like. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4965.48s)]
*  Responsibility to keep doing it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4970.72s)]
*  So my process is to keep doing it, just to write. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4973.8s)]
*  So you don't have like very specific methods. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4977.76s)]
*  You don't have like I am going to sit down at nine a.m. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4982.84s)]
*  and have a cup of coffee. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4985.56s)]
*  Yeah, I've been I do that. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4986.64s)]
*  I do that, you know, and it's really good for, you know, me and my husband [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4988.2s)]
*  because he's a writer and he works from home. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4991.88s)]
*  So like he goes to his area. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4994.28s)]
*  I go to mine and like [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=4996.8s)]
*  this creative energy in the house. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5000.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it's motivating, too, because like I know he's doing something amazing. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5002.48s)]

*  Oh, I love it. I love it. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5014.16s)]
*  Standards are higher. Yeah. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5015.48s)]
*  And he's just so beautiful, creatively, intellectually, like books. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5016.84s)]
*  He's always giving me books like Suzy'd love this. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  And like, you know, I love his brain. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5022.6s)]
*  Like he's just so generous with everything he knows about, which is, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5025.04s)]
*  I think, a very special quality, you know, like he's not a dick about it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5030.200000000001s)]
*  Like he wants to share. Yeah. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5034.6s)]
*  And I always want to learn. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5037.08s)]
*  But, you know, I'm learning this new program. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5039.240000000001s)]
*  I'm learning logic, which is like Pro Tools. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5042.8s)]
*  And that's been a different approach to writing because I'm building these tracks, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5044.84s)]
*  which is really fun. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5048.92s)]
*  And then I'm writing the lyrics and the melodies to the tracks I've built, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5050.160000000001s)]
*  which I don't normally do it like that. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5054.12s)]
*  I kind of like sit down and figure it out with my guitar. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5055.68s)]
*  So I'm kind of writing like pop songs right now, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5059.4400000000005s)]
*  which I'm not sure if they're for me or for others, but I enjoy the process. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5061.84s)]
*  What do you mean by you're not sure if they're for you or for others? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5066.68s)]
*  Because I can write songs for other people. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5070.04s)]
*  Do you do that often? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5072.56s)]
*  Not often, but it's something I'm starting to do, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5074.72s)]
*  which is really fun, you know, like that's what Sia did for a long time. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5077.76s)]
*  Like she was writing these hit songs. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5083.2s)]
*  And she also had 07, which is a band from, I think, the 90s [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5085.12s)]
*  and her own solo stuff, which is amazing. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5089.72s)]
*  But like she like exploded after she'd written a bunch of hit songs [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5092.400000000001s)]
*  for other artists, which I always thought was cool. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5097.2s)]
*  So when you're writing these pop songs, are you writing them thinking? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5100.56s)]
*  I don't even know if this is for me. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5104.0s)]
*  You just just creating. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5106.68s)]
*  You know, I'm just I'm just trying to get the idea out there. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5108.04s)]
*  Like I try not to pepper it with an outcome, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5110.4800000000005s)]
*  because then it kind of feels like it's. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5114.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5119.280000000001s)]
*  I just doesn't feel like the right place for me to come from when I'm making something. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5119.72s)]
*  Like I just want to formulate the idea and have it be beautiful [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5123.72s)]
*  and, you know, best as I can. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5129.6s)]
*  And you just not even sure if it's for you sometimes. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5131.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5134.68s)]
*  How would you know, though, if you're writing it and you're performing it [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5136.4s)]
*  and you're creating it and you're like, maybe this isn't even for me. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5139.36s)]
*  Like, what gives you that feeling that is it that it doesn't fit with your image? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5143.599999999999s)]
*  Is it that? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5147.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's that maybe it's like, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5150.28s)]
*  I'll bet somebody else could really sell this, you know, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5153.24s)]
*  because then it becomes, you know, it depends. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5156.08s)]
*  Like, I don't even know what my image is, to be honest with you. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5158.84s)]
*  And I think that's probably good. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5162.36s)]
*  Yeah, like that's I mean, I don't know. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5163.5599999999995s)]
*  I was going to say that's half the problem for me is like, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5165.04s)]
*  you can never fit me into a box like and that's always been difficult. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5166.84s)]
*  Like people just say I play Americana music, but like I play rock and roll. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5170.64s)]
*  And I also love synthesizers and all the stuff and, you know, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5175.6s)]
*  and soul music and, you know, I don't know. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5180.28s)]
*  I think that's better. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5184.16s)]
*  I think I mean, some of my favorite artists, like they're so different [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5185.84s)]
*  from album to album, like Sturgill is a great example. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5188.64s)]
*  He's great. He's great. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5191.48s)]
*  He's so different from album to album. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5192.88s)]
*  He flips people on their head like, what the fuck is he doing now? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5195.08s)]
*  But he also has the I mean, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5198.32s)]
*  he that the big record, you know, the first one, like he has that [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5202.0s)]
*  that malleability to be able to do that, you know, I mean, I guess everybody does. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5208.4400000000005s)]
*  You can make whatever kind of music you want. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5213.12s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but you know, what he does is he goes off grid [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5214.56s)]
*  and he got rid of his phone and he has one of them simple phones now. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5218.76s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5222.6s)]
*  All you can do is text him and it's only green. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5223.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. He can't get links. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5225.6s)]
*  It's only green. Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5227.4800000000005s)]
*  He didn't get links. I wanted to do that. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5229.4800000000005s)]
*  I probably will at some point. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5231.360000000001s)]
*  He's serious about it. Yeah. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5233.200000000001s)]
*  He's pretty disciplined about it, too. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5234.8s)]
*  I think Jack White does that, too. Yeah. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5236.6s)]
*  I heard once that, I mean, this is hearsay that he doesn't even have a cell phone. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5238.360000000001s)]
*  I think he just has email. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5241.92s)]
*  Mm hmm. But, you know, that's the new punk rock, I guess. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5243.280000000001s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people out there that are realizing [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5247.52s)]
*  that your brain is being captured by all these different things [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5250.12s)]
*  that are on your device and it does occupy a lot of your time. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5252.72s)]
*  Yes, it does. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5256.5199999999995s)]
*  My phone broke once when I was in Hawaii. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5257.4s)]
*  We went to Lanai and I dropped my phone and it just started calling people randomly. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5259.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, like you'd hang up on it to call a new person. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5263.5199999999995s)]
*  Hang up and call a new person. Oh, no. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5266.2s)]
*  And I was like, look at this. This is nuts. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5267.68s)]
*  And so I realized it was broken. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5269.44s)]
*  So I had to get a new phone. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5271.2s)]
*  But we were on Lanai and it took like three or four days to ship it to me. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5272.44s)]
*  Yeah. So I ordered it and in three days, no phone. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5277.719999999999s)]
*  How was that? On vacation. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5280.36s)]
*  It was amazing. Yeah. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like I have this like giant weight. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5282.799999999999s)]
*  But meanwhile, I couldn't wait to get back to prison. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5284.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. To mental prison and get that phone and that Stockholm syndrome. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5287.04s)]
*  Check all the text that I got that don't mean anything like [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5290.839999999999s)]
*  falling in love with your captor. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5294.24s)]
*  Once again, Greek tragedy. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5295.44s)]
*  Once again. Yeah. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5297.36s)]
*  The little dopamine rush that you get from checking text messages and emails. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5299.0s)]
*  And I always feel so dirty with that. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5303.36s)]
*  Like, oh, look at all those likes. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5305.96s)]
*  I got and I feel good about myself. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5308.04s)]
*  Damn it. Yeah, the likes. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5310.4800000000005s)]
*  That's that's a real real fucking carrot at the end of the stick. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5311.92s)]
*  You know what I did enjoy? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5316.04s)]
*  And I try to like put like. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5317.28s)]
*  When I posted photos from my wedding, that was actually really cool. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5320.92s)]
*  Just like all the love and support and then like, yeah, and just [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5325.8s)]
*  it wasn't about, you know, my career or anything. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5330.84s)]
*  It was about like the most important thing in my life. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5334.08s)]
*  And that was cool. That's actual life. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5337.24s)]
*  That's what those things are supposed to be for. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5339.6s)]
*  Sharing actual real moments with people you actually care about. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5341.84s)]
*  The problem with social media is that it's intoxicating [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5345.64s)]
*  and people get drunk off of it and they just want to be just dosed. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5348.96s)]
*  Yeah. All throughout the day. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5353.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, man, I'll tell you what, I am so worried about our kids. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5354.96s)]
*  Like we grew up with our own stuff, right? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5359.88s)]
*  Like I grew up in the 90s and like, you know, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5362.88s)]
*  you would compare yourself to a magazine or something [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5366.84s)]
*  or like the popular girls at school or whatever the fuck. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5369.52s)]
*  And now, like every reflection of your face is on something [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5373.24s)]
*  that you can manipulate and look better on your phone. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5377.320000000001s)]
*  And you can you can change like your bone structure. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5380.64s)]
*  I mean, all that stuff, like what a mindfuck of complexes. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5386.400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, also just like your attention span. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5390.72s)]
*  We were I was talking with the guys outside about spelling, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5394.68s)]
*  you know, that were just suited up for so many bad spellers. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5398.92s)]
*  And, you know, because you have your autocorrect on your phone [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5403.36s)]
*  and you don't really write things out like on a piece of paper with a pencil or a pen. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5405.6s)]
*  And, you know, those are call me a traditionalist. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5410.2s)]
*  But one of the things that people realized about like AI [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5413.24s)]
*  and recognizing problem words and flagging things, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5416.56s)]
*  if you're writing cursive, AI doesn't pick that up. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5419.24s)]
*  Oh, nice. So people are writing a cursive and then taking a photograph of that thing [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5421.4s)]
*  and then posting that. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5424.679999999999s)]
*  So you could post messages about certain things. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5426.04s)]
*  I always write in cursive for the most part. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5428.639999999999s)]
*  Do you really? Mm hmm. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5430.679999999999s)]
*  It's a journal a lot. I love it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5432.08s)]
*  When I write somebody a card, it's cursive. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5434.08s)]
*  It's not as neat as I would like it to be, but it's cursive. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5436.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's exciting. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5439.84s)]
*  It's old school, old timey writing. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5442.28s)]
*  The calligraphy of today. Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5444.84s)]
*  I know this sounds crazy, but I have to be. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5447.08s)]
*  I have to be too. OK, so let's be and then we'll come back. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5448.6s)]
*  Let's play some music. OK, great. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5451.04s)]
*  All right. We're right back. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5452.400000000001s)]
*  Do you want to hear some music? Sure. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5454.8s)]
*  So I told you I was going to play these songs that I haven't recorded or released. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5457.68s)]
*  So this might be the only place you could hear them. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5461.96s)]
*  OK, but I think I'm going to record them. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5464.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5467.0s)]
*  You tell me this is a dream, but I'm grinding my teeth and spilling my cup in the back seat [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5478.56s)]
*  and pulling your hair. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5490.64s)]
*  You drive too slow because you don't care if we get there. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5492.76s)]
*  Will we ever get there? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5499.52s)]
*  Sometimes I just wish that you would spin out and lose your mind because it's honest [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5509.56s)]
*  and it's all I ever wanted from you. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5518.04s)]
*  From you. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5529.56s)]
*  You want me to go to sleep and make things easy on you. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5533.56s)]
*  But I'm not tired anyway and I don't want to waste a day. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5543.320000000001s)]

*  If you want me to [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5953.56s)]
*  I was an actor and I was a working actor. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5984.56s)]
*  And I had like, I lived in New York [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5986.56s)]
*  and I moved to LA when I was almost 20. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5988.56s)]
*  And I was doing pretty well in New York. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5991.56s)]
*  And then when I got to LA, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5993.56s)]
*  I had to get to the back of the line [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5995.56s)]
*  of the acting world. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5997.56s)]
*  And my love for it had changed into desperation [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=5999.56s)]
*  because I wanted to work, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6003.56s)]
*  like I needed money. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6005.56s)]
*  And so my, when I think about like [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6007.56s)]
*  I've been in New York, I've been in New York, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6011.56s)]
*  and I feel like I might have done really well [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6013.56s)]
*  as an actor for a little while. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6015.56s)]
*  Who knows, that's, you know. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6017.56s)]
*  But I don't know what kind of person I would have become. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6019.56s)]
*  Because music is such a, it's so different. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6022.56s)]
*  Like when you're acting, like, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6026.56s)]
*  you are employed by a company [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6028.56s)]
*  and a director and a writer [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6032.56s)]
*  and all the things that like, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6034.56s)]
*  you embody the thing, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6036.56s)]
*  in a way, you know. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6038.56s)]
*  Music is personal, it's therapeutic, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6040.56s)]
*  it's a sincere outlet, you know, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6044.56s)]
*  that is healthy in a lot of ways. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6051.56s)]
*  So I always wondered, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6054.56s)]
*  like man, would I have been a total dick [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6056.56s)]
*  if I had made it as an actor? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6058.56s)]
*  But yeah, it's weird. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6061.56s)]
*  What about you? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6065.56s)]
*  Like if you didn't do comedy, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6066.56s)]
*  if you weren't acting when you were younger, like, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6068.56s)]
*  I'd be a fan. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6071.56s)]
*  Love watching you on news radio, by the way. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6073.56s)]
*  It's so fun, it's so fun. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6075.56s)]
*  I'm like, that's my friend. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6076.56s)]
*  And like my daughter loves it. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6077.56s)]
*  Like she's like, make sure you tell Joe [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6079.56s)]
*  how much we love news radio. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6080.56s)]
*  It's so weird seeing a young me. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6081.56s)]
*  You were great. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6084.56s)]
*  It's so fun. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6085.56s)]
*  And that show was funny. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6086.56s)]
*  It was a good show. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6087.56s)]
*  It was really good. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6088.56s)]
*  It spoiled me for sure. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6089.56s)]
*  I went from being on a really bad show [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6090.56s)]
*  to being on that show. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6092.56s)]
*  What was the other show? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6093.56s)]
*  It was called Hardballs on Fox. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6094.56s)]
*  Started off really good, really good writers. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6096.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6098.56s)]
*  These guys who wrote for the Simpsons. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6099.56s)]
*  They wrote for Married with Children. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6101.56s)]
*  And it was that classic story of the network [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6103.56s)]
*  getting involved and ruining it [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6105.56s)]
*  and putting on a hack executive producer [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6107.56s)]
*  who had done a bunch of hacky sitcoms, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6111.56s)]
*  like really clunky shitty sitcoms. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6113.56s)]
*  And he just wasn't very good. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6115.56s)]
*  And there was a lot of talented people on the show. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6117.56s)]
*  That's such a tough thing as an actor, too, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6121.56s)]
*  because a job's a job. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6123.56s)]
*  Do you want to do that or do you want to bartend? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6124.56s)]
*  But then do you want to like, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6127.56s)]
*  does that torpedo your career for a future, you know, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6128.56s)]
*  it's just such a roll of the dice. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6131.56s)]
*  I didn't have any aspirations. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6133.56s)]
*  So I was extremely fortunate. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6134.56s)]
*  It was just luck. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6138.56s)]
*  It was 100% luck. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6139.56s)]
*  I didn't take any acting lessons. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6140.56s)]
*  I wasn't an actor. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6142.56s)]
*  No, I wasn't an actor at all. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6143.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you have that bold spirit [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6144.56s)]
*  that's going to take risks. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6146.56s)]
*  So that is what an actor is. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6148.56s)]
*  Obviously, I'm sure you kept learning more about it [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6150.56s)]
*  as you did it, but like, you know, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6155.56s)]
*  committing to this story that's in front of you [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6157.56s)]
*  and becoming this thing. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6161.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, my point was that it wasn't something [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6163.56s)]
*  that I was interested in doing. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6165.56s)]
*  It was something that was offered to me. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6167.56s)]
*  And you were also doing comedy? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6169.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6170.56s)]
*  I was doing stand-up first. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6171.56s)]
*  And that's how I got a development deal. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6172.56s)]
*  And they made me go to an acting coach in New York [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6175.56s)]
*  a couple of times. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6178.56s)]
*  So it was very... I didn't enjoy it. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6179.56s)]
*  It just felt weird. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6182.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6184.56s)]
*  And it's just like... [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6185.56s)]
*  I felt like the kind of acting... [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6186.56s)]
*  If you're talking about like Daniel Day-Lewis acting, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6188.56s)]
*  yeah, that is really fucking hard. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6190.56s)]
*  But if you're talking about me playing a dumbass on TV, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6192.56s)]
*  like, I can do that. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6195.56s)]
*  I know how to perform. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6197.56s)]
*  It's like not much different than stand-up. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6198.56s)]
*  It's like a next-door neighbor of stand-up. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6200.56s)]
*  Because you're doing it in front of a live crowd, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6202.56s)]
*  and you're interacting with other people that are really funny. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6204.56s)]
*  Not that hard. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6206.56s)]
*  It's just different. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6207.56s)]
*  You just got to get used to doing it. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6208.56s)]
*  And I think the only way you really get used to doing it [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6210.56s)]
*  is like if you were doing it with other people. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6213.56s)]
*  Like in acting class, I was taking it. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6215.56s)]
*  I just don't know how effective that was. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6217.56s)]
*  But the point is, it's like when I was doing it, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6219.56s)]
*  it wasn't something I wanted to do, and it was terrible. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6221.56s)]
*  The show was terrible. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6223.56s)]
*  We all knew it was terrible. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6224.56s)]
*  And then because of all the aforementioned problems [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6226.56s)]
*  that they had with it. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6229.56s)]
*  And then right after that, that show gets canned, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6230.56s)]
*  and then I get on news radio. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6232.56s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my god, this is like the greatest show. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6234.56s)]
*  How many seasons did you do? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6236.56s)]
*  Five seasons. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6237.56s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6238.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6239.56s)]
*  We did four with Phil Hartman and one with John Lovitz. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6240.56s)]
*  And did that set up your life? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6243.56s)]
*  Like you could set up your finances? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6245.56s)]
*  Not really. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6248.56s)]
*  No. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6249.56s)]
*  No, because I was a moron, and I spent every dollar I earned. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6250.56s)]
*  Copy that. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6253.56s)]
*  Isn't that such a thing? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6254.56s)]
*  I feel like they should teach. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6255.56s)]
*  Like no one taught me about money either. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6256.56s)]
*  I had to learn the hard way. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6258.56s)]
*  And that sucks. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6259.56s)]
*  That's such a valuable skill set to have. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6260.56s)]
*  One thing it did, it gave me freedom. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6263.56s)]
*  Like because I had some money, I didn't worry about not having [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6265.56s)]
*  any money for food or rent or shit like that, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6268.56s)]
*  which is like the real heavy expense. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6270.56s)]
*  The heavy thing over people's head is like their credit card debt, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6272.56s)]
*  whatever debt they have. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6275.56s)]
*  And I remember when I first started making money, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6276.56s)]
*  the first thing that I noticed was the lightness of like life had a lightness to it [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6278.56s)]
*  because the stress of bills were off. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6284.56s)]
*  And I was like, wow, how much does that weight [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6286.56s)]
*  you carry around on your shoulders all the time? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6288.56s)]
*  I felt like physically, I felt like a weight was lifted off of me. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6290.56s)]
*  Of course. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6294.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6295.56s)]
*  That is like, sometimes too, that's like a spiritual practice too. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6296.56s)]
*  Like you have to get out of that struggle mindset because like think about like [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6303.56s)]
*  people that win the lottery and then spend it all in six months [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6306.56s)]
*  and go right back to where they were. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6309.56s)]
*  Like it is, it's energy, you know, and it's acceptance [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6311.56s)]
*  and having a really interesting relationship with yourself [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6315.56s)]
*  and what you view as needs, you know, like you think you need, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6321.56s)]
*  like I need that car, I need this blah, blah, blah, I need it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6324.56s)]
*  You know, all the shit that you really don't at all. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6327.56s)]
*  Mostly it's nonsense. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6330.56s)]
*  Nonsense. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6331.56s)]
*  Mostly nonsense. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6332.56s)]
*  You can enjoy some things that you like. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6333.56s)]
*  The idea that you don't enjoy like physical things, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6335.56s)]
*  like a piece of art like this thing, like I enjoy this thing, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6337.56s)]
*  this physical thing. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6341.56s)]
*  That's different. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6342.56s)]
*  Obviously because it's art. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6343.56s)]
*  But even, you know, there's stuff that people enjoy about wealth, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6345.56s)]
*  but it's generally not worth the amount of effort [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6350.56s)]
*  that you have to apply to get those things. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6354.56s)]
*  What really is valuable is the things that you enjoy that make you happy, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6356.56s)]
*  whether it's fly fishing or whether it's fucking, yeah, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6360.56s)]
*  whatever your thing is. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6364.56s)]
*  Like the only thing that's going to make you happy is doing that thing. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6366.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6370.56s)]
*  The other stuff that comes with it, like the money and stuff like that, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6371.56s)]
*  is like that can become a problem of its own for some people [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6374.56s)]
*  because you start concentrating only on that and making more of that. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6377.56s)]
*  And what do I have to do to maximize that? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6380.56s)]
*  And then that becomes a primary focus as opposed to like what you actually enjoy doing. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6382.56s)]
*  Well, and you know these people, right? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6387.56s)]
*  The people that like, they're very unhappy. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6389.56s)]
*  Like that is a lifestyle that is a perpetual agony almost in some ways. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6392.56s)]
*  Like it's just, I don't know, like you outgrow it and then you're like, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6401.56s)]
*  what are you going to be like that old guy who's like, you know, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6406.56s)]
*  on his boat with all the women? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6410.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6412.56s)]
*  Like I am. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6414.56s)]
*  Where does it go? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6415.56s)]
*  Where does it go? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6416.56s)]
*  Does it go to the south of France with a diamond encrusted watch [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6417.56s)]
*  and you're showing everybody what you have? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6419.56s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6422.56s)]
*  Well, there's that contemplate your death thing again. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6423.56s)]
*  You know, it's like it's nice to set up your family [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6425.56s)]
*  and make sure everybody's okay and provided for. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6428.56s)]
*  And it is freedom. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6431.56s)]
*  But also like it'll tear families apart. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6432.56s)]
*  Money will ruin people. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6434.56s)]
*  Like it's a very fickle thing. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6436.56s)]
*  It certainly can. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6438.56s)]
*  And the access to it, like family money, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6440.56s)]
*  like if there's like some dude who owns some oil company and he's dying [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6443.56s)]
*  and all the family starts fighting over how much, you know, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6446.56s)]
*  they're trying to get closer to dad and you know what she's been saying [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6449.56s)]
*  behind your back and like what? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6452.56s)]
*  That cunt. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6454.56s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6455.56s)]
*  It's ugly and sad. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6456.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6458.56s)]
*  People are nuts when it comes to money. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6459.56s)]
*  And I've seen it with the saddest ones are when someone dies [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6461.56s)]
*  and like the family's fighting with the boyfriend of the person who died [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6465.56s)]
*  or the girlfriend. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6470.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6471.56s)]
*  It's like, Jesus Christ. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6472.56s)]
*  They're squabbling over money. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6473.56s)]
*  And they have lawyers involved and lawyers are looking out for their best [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6475.56s)]
*  interests or everybody's trying to get a piece. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6478.56s)]
*  There's like that middle road for me of because I've had my whole life, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6480.56s)]
*  like, you know, except for now, which is so new for me in a way. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6485.56s)]
*  But like feast or famine, like music is like you get a record deal [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6489.56s)]
*  and it's never even feast. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6494.56s)]
*  It's like you get like 30 grand and you live in L.A. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6495.56s)]
*  and that's and you have to split it and you get 1099. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6497.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6500.56s)]
*  So like none of that works. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6501.56s)]
*  Like it all sucks. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6502.56s)]
*  I mean, like when I was in Honey Honey, we were we would do months and months [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6503.56s)]
*  and months of touring and I would come back in the hole because like it costs [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6508.56s)]
*  so much money to be out there. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6513.56s)]
*  And then you know, but you're like having this great experience [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6515.56s)]
*  and you're spreading your work and you get to do your work. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6518.56s)]
*  And you know, you still like you're not starving, but like you don't have [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6521.56s)]
*  your own apartment. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6525.56s)]
*  You know, it's it's really interesting. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6526.56s)]
*  And I had to work like really hard, like, you know, emotionally [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6529.56s)]
*  and spiritually on my relationship with my struggle as an artist, like [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6532.56s)]
*  and then like getting over it. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6536.56s)]
*  When I when I I toured with Hozier, I was in his band and that was like [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6540.56s)]
*  the first time in my life. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6545.56s)]
*  I like I had like I made really nice money in that band and it set me up [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6547.56s)]
*  for my record and it was the first time I really didn't worry. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6551.56s)]
*  And that was only like three years ago. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6555.56s)]
*  But you and you know, and honey honey together particularly gave me real [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6557.56s)]
*  insight into how difficult it is to make in the music business because I [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6564.56s)]
*  always thought you just had to be talented. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6568.56s)]
*  And it's just it's weird what catches and what doesn't catch because I [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6572.56s)]
*  remember the first time I saw you guys, I'm like, these guys are going [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6577.56s)]
*  to be fucking huge. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6579.56s)]
*  You know what, though, there's so many different ways to do it. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6581.56s)]
*  Like we've made so many great friends. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6584.56s)]
*  I've made so many wonderful friends. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6587.56s)]
*  I have these beautiful relationships with my extended family that I would [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6588.56s)]
*  never see if I weren't a touring musician like my cousins in Atlanta, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6592.56s)]
*  who I love so much. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6596.56s)]
*  I would never have a relationship with these people if I didn't see them [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6598.56s)]
*  a couple of times a year. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6602.56s)]
*  And they're wonderful. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6603.56s)]
*  And like there's all these other people that I've never seen. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6604.56s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest thing about it. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6608.56s)]
*  Wonderful. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6610.56s)]
*  And like there there's all these other rewards. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6611.56s)]
*  And there are a lot of people that notice it, that notice like, oh, man, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6615.56s)]

*  I see what's going on here. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6620.56s)]
*  Like, you know, and then there's other people that think that like my life [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6621.56s)]
*  is glamorous or something like you have the absolute wrong idea. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6624.56s)]
*  The music business is very hard. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6628.56s)]
*  There's King. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6630.56s)]

*  Agreed. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6640.56s)]
*  He's you know, there's Roger Waters. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6641.56s)]
*  You know, there's people that can just like sell everything everywhere. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6643.56s)]
*  And Roger like came up in a very different time when like, yeah, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6647.56s)]
*  even if you weren't Pink Floyd and you weren't Roger, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6651.56s)]
*  like you could still make a ton of money in some ways, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6655.56s)]
*  like depending on who you were and what kind of music you were playing, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6659.56s)]
*  you know, with like one song. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6661.56s)]
*  Because records would sell. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6663.56s)]
*  Because people paid for it. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6665.56s)]
*  You get the money for it. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6666.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6667.56s)]
*  And you could sell everything with that was the number one thing that [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6668.56s)]
*  enhanced some people's appreciation for music and killed record sales all in [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6672.56s)]
*  one thing. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6678.56s)]
*  It's very double edged sword Spotify. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6679.56s)]
*  Well, it was way before that. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6681.56s)]
*  It was really Napster. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6683.56s)]
*  Yeah, Napster. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6684.56s)]
*  Napster was free. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6685.56s)]
*  I used to download all that shit and then like fry my Dell computer with [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6686.56s)]
*  viruses because like, you know, you'd like you'd get a you'd get a clue on [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6690.56s)]
*  what's the new like download service. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6693.56s)]
*  And then, you know, I remember like all these tricks to like override my [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6695.56s)]
*  computer so I could just burn that CD. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6698.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6700.56s)]
*  Yeah, I remember the Napster days. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6701.56s)]
*  And I remember like having like a personal group agreement with myself [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6704.56s)]
*  that if I got something from Napster and it was good, I'd go buy the CD. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6707.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6712.56s)]
*  So make a personal agreement. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6713.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6714.56s)]
*  Well, I just felt gross because here I am. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6715.56s)]
*  I'm on television and I've got Napster. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6717.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6719.56s)]
*  Getting stuff for free. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6720.56s)]
*  That's gross. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6721.56s)]
*  So I just. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6722.56s)]
*  But you're an artist, so you know the difference. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6723.56s)]
*  But also, P.S., like if there's someone that can't afford my music and they [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6725.56s)]
*  want to hear it, like please listen to it. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6728.56s)]
*  Like, you know, like it's at this point. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6730.56s)]
*  Some of it feels like an act of service and I'm not mad at that. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6736.56s)]
*  Like I love to play music for people. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6739.56s)]

*  And I keep getting better at it. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6744.56s)]
*  So why would I stop? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6746.56s)]
*  You know, and like I keep learning new things about, you know, my violin or, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6747.56s)]
*  you know, my banjo and like I picked up my banjo for the first time recently and [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6752.56s)]
*  I forgot how much I loved it, you know, and I used to play that thing every [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6755.56s)]
*  night. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6759.56s)]
*  You know, it's just kind of at this point in terms of artistic commodities and [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6760.56s)]
*  like monetizing this stuff like. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6768.56s)]
*  What I really care about is the human experience of of that moment when you're [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6773.56s)]
*  having that connection and you're sharing this thing. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6779.56s)]

*  of thousands and thousands of people. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6790.56s)]
*  And I've done both and it's great. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6792.56s)]

*  And so like, you know, extracting my ego from my expectations of what I thought [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6797.56s)]
*  it was going to be like or what I have no idea. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=6803.56s)]

*  And then if you could do your art locally, it would be great for the most part. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7176.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's that's our idea of opening up the comedy club here, too. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7179.56s)]

*  It's a good show. It sure does. It gives you like a woo. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7208.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting little woo. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7212.56s)]
*  I don't know if they're more than other ones. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7214.56s)]
*  It's so funny there that that one is everywhere. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7217.56s)]

*  I don't know. I'm not sure. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7222.56s)]
*  I don't like its grip on me. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7226.56s)]
*  You said that so convincingly. I don't know. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7228.56s)]
*  I don't know. I'll be honest with you always. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7230.56s)]
*  Count on me for that. I do. Thanks. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7233.56s)]
*  Oh, man. Yeah, we're both super lucky. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7237.56s)]
*  I think we do. It's a good life. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7241.56s)]
*  It is. But like, again, like thanks for bringing me to Austin. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7244.56s)]
*  I'm so happy you came. You really like. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7247.56s)]
*  I'm so happy so many people listen to me. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7249.56s)]
*  I was like, listen, I think we got a way out of this. Yeah. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7251.56s)]
*  But we got a banded ship and it was the right call. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7254.56s)]
*  It really was the right. It's a hard call, but it's an exciting call. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7258.56s)]
*  Because when you do something new like that and you go to a new invite, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7261.56s)]
*  it gives you a chance to sort of rethink everything. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7264.56s)]
*  I think reset new pathways. Re-evaluate. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7268.56s)]
*  Everything is different. The town's different. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7271.56s)]
*  The people are different. The vibe's different. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7273.56s)]
*  You got a whole new sort of like reset of what your priorities are in life. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7275.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, man, I have never associated with the like autopilot, you know. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7281.56s)]
*  And even if I were in a place where I I weren't doing what I do and having this kind of life, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7289.56s)]
*  I would want to read. I would want to learn a craft. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7295.56s)]
*  I would want to become a falconer. You know, all the things. True story. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7297.56s)]
*  I believe you. But like, you know, re-examine my life, contemplate my thoughts and, you know, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7302.56s)]
*  really just grow. Like, why the fuck not? Right. Why the fuck not? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7312.56s)]
*  There's just too much life to live. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7318.56s)]
*  And also, like, again, like the more I stay away from my phone and all that stuff that that takes away from my, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7321.56s)]
*  you know, my own agency and my person and like just sit back and like look around like, you know, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7327.56s)]
*  I'm very lucky and I'm very grateful. I really am. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7336.56s)]
*  Aziz Ansari was talking about that on stage the other night. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7340.56s)]
*  There's a video of it of him. He has a flip phone now. Good for him. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7342.56s)]
*  He's like, I got my brain back. Yeah. I got my mind back. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7346.56s)]
*  I mean, how long are you in the bathroom in the morning when you have your phone with you? [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7349.56s)]
*  It's a lot longer than it used to be. Yeah. Yeah. You get hemorrhoids from sitting on the toilet for too long. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7353.56s)]
*  It's bad for you. I like I like spirit away when I'm like, I got to pee and I'll just be in there. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7358.56s)]
*  Yeah. And you can hear the videos or whatever I'm watching and I'll hear like I'll hear like, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7365.56s)]
*  are you watching videos in the bathroom? No. It's embarrassing. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7371.56s)]
*  It's as embarrassing as someone asking you if they woke you up. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7376.56s)]
*  You're like, no, I'm awake. I was like, you always lie. Always lie. I was wide awake. I'm wide awake. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7380.56s)]
*  Well, I talk in my sleep and so I'll have like I'll say something and then I'll realize I said something and then I'll try to justify it. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7386.56s)]
*  Like I meant that. Like I said, like, no, no, no, no, you're not going to make fun of me. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7392.56s)]
*  Like I talking in the sleep is a weird one. I was singing in my sleep. Really? And yeah, I sang in my sleep and I woke myself up when I woke up. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7397.56s)]
*  Nick and he went he was like, shh. And I almost went you love this song. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7405.56s)]
*  We had this like cross anyway. We I talk in my sleep and then I try to make it make sense because I'm embarrassed. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7413.56s)]
*  Taekwondo days I would have Taekwondo dreams. Really? Kicking dreams. I'd like wake up kicking. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7421.56s)]
*  Sounds dangerous. Yeah. Wake up like moving very fast in the sheets. Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7427.56s)]
*  It's like programming my brain. Oh my God. No competition. So I was sleeping. I was having Taekwondo matches in my head. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7433.56s)]
*  It's hilarious. It's true. It's true. I used to have kicking. I'd wake up like in the middle of a kick. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7439.56s)]
*  Like my whole body would be moving like I was kicking. Oh my God. Yeah. While I was asleep. Yeah. Wow. It was so stupid. Programmed. Yeah. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7446.56s)]
*  But that's what it is. It's like you're programming yourself for something. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7453.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's like the song thing. It'll really in your sleep. If you're thinking about your songs. Yeah. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7458.56s)]
*  And while you're sleeping, you're singing. It makes sense. Totally makes sense. Like is your program in your mind. Yeah. To create songs. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7464.56s)]
*  I also do this thing like when there's a burgeoning confrontation on the horizon that needs to be had with somebody, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7470.56s)]
*  I am having the conversation in my half sleep, like in the wee hours of the morning. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7479.56s)]
*  And it is like this. It feels haunting. Like it's like, oh, fuck, I finally got to do it. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7485.56s)]
*  I got to tell them I got it. I got to say the thing I just have been avoiding. Like it will keep me up at night, which feels really unfair. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7491.56s)]
*  I can't just ignore it. It'll like kick me upside the head until I take care of it. And then I sleep like a baby. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7498.56s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. It's probably a good thing, though, because if you could just go to sleep whenever you have like real conflicts going on, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7505.56s)]
*  if they didn't bother you enough, maybe it never resolve them. Correct. You know, maybe that's like some people's problems that they don't accept. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7512.56s)]
*  Maybe you don't learn how to accept it. You don't learn how to think about interpersonal interactions and problems and issues. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7519.56s)]
*  I think that I think that's your spirit. That's like clean up. Yeah. Go clean up. Your place is a fucking mess. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7528.56s)]
*  You're creating unnecessary negativity. There's plenty of necessary negativity out there. Yeah. You don't need to create any unnecessary negativity. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7538.56s)]
*  100 percent. Yeah. And that's like like little pieces fall in place when you have conversations, when you're with people like you put this there and then they put that there. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7546.56s)]
*  And then you're like, but what about this? And then the next thing you know, like a totally unnecessary dispute takes place. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7554.56s)]
*  It's common things for humans. Well, to be challenged is a gift in so many ways, because like, what are you going to do with that? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7560.56s)]
*  What are you going to do with that? You know, conversation you don't want to have or that thing about yourself you don't like. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7568.56s)]
*  Like you got to do something, you know, because it's going to it's going to keep getting you. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7574.56s)]
*  And like I, you know, you get these opportunities to like obtain like a piece of wisdom if you can help it, you know. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7578.56s)]
*  And it's always through this the darker things or the things that are fucking annoying. Yeah. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7590.56s)]
*  And lately I've been so aware of my lineage, like my family tree and like my parents, my grandparents, my great grandparents and me. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7596.56s)]
*  And then, you know, my my stepdaughter and, you know, if we have more kids like where I sit in this line of generational personalities and habits and where I see the mistakes and where I want to make corrections. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7606.56s)]
*  And it's really powerful. I mean, you really have to look at yourself and the things you don't like and the things you you like or love. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7621.56s)]
*  And it's it's a really defining moment lately. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7629.56s)]
*  Like, I just feel my, again, responsibility to what is most important. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7635.56s)]
*  And there's like I'm so proud to be from the family I'm from and like the kind of people. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7643.56s)]
*  And then there's so many things I'm like, oh, God, you know. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7648.56s)]
*  And it feels like a real job to like heal generational wounds and bad habits. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7654.56s)]
*  And yeah, I'm just like. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7660.56s)]
*  Because if I whatever I can do, I want to give the best things to my children. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7664.56s)]
*  You know. Yeah, you're trying to be a good person. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7670.56s)]
*  But I come from this really long line of hustlers like my great grandmother was a bookie. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7678.56s)]
*  My great grandfather was a bootlegger. My grandfather was a bookie and a prisoner of war for two years in World War Two. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7683.56s)]
*  Like he was shot down from an airplane. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7691.56s)]
*  And like he was a waste gunner, like one of the most dangerous jobs you could have. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7695.56s)]
*  And he got captured and like he survived an 82 day death march and and like made it back home to Cleveland. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7701.56s)]
*  And like he married my grandmother, who was an excellent cook, and all the money he had from being a bookie. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7712.56s)]
*  And they they built this these restaurants in Cleveland with my grandma's recipes. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7721.56s)]
*  And it's amazing. Like the food's so good. And it's like my family legacy. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7726.56s)]
*  And I'm just fascinated by those people. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7731.56s)]
*  And I'm I feel really lucky to to be their granddaughter. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7736.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a that's a that's a fascinating fucking story. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7741.56s)]
*  It's pretty wild. How did he survive? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7745.56s)]
*  Oh, man. How did he survive the crash? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7748.56s)]
*  He parachuted out. So he parachuted out and then he gets captured. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7751.56s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah. He so he never talked about his experience until he was almost 80. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7755.56s)]
*  So he didn't tell like my even my dad, like nobody knew what my grandfather went through. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7763.56s)]
*  And he got inspired by somebody to finally tell us what he like to tell his family. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7769.56s)]
*  And he took a year doing voice recordings with with his sister. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7777.56s)]
*  I pretty sure is my aunt Rita to tell a story. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7782.56s)]
*  And then like one day when I was in L.A. when I was 22, I got this book in the mail and it was his like he gave it to our family so we could all know about what his experience in World War Two was. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7786.56s)]
*  And being a prisoner of war. And I mean, it was I mean, I mean, I was bawling. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7798.56s)]
*  It's like makes me emotional just talking about it. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7803.56s)]
*  Like he had finally had this moment where he felt like it was OK to tell everybody. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7805.56s)]
*  And it was like very polite and sanitized. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7810.56s)]
*  And then like by the end of his life, he really wanted to talk about it more and more in greater detail. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7814.56s)]
*  But he carried one of his friends during that 82 day march because I can't remember where they were moving them. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7820.56s)]
*  But it was, you know, like you walk for 82 days, like you can't stop to take a shit or pee. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7828.56s)]
*  Like you just like he had dysentery, he had lice, like he was he was filthy. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7834.56s)]
*  And I like actually shortly before he died, I went to visit him and he was telling like he just wanted to talk and like tell me these things. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7839.56s)]
*  And, you know, I remember him saying to me like and he like looked me in the eye and he was like, you do not know filth. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7848.56s)]
*  You don't know filth. And just being like if you stopped, they killed you. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7857.56s)]
*  So you had to keep going. And one of his friends, he carried him. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7863.56s)]
*  And I remember this old man because my parents used to send us to Florida where like in the summers where my grandparents lived. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7867.56s)]
*  And we'd spend like two, three weeks with them. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7874.56s)]
*  And it was awesome. But, you know, grandpa was usually watching the Sopranos with his headphones on. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7876.56s)]
*  You know, they were so Italian. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7882.56s)]
*  But his old friend was like I remember I think it was like I don't want to butcher this, but I think it was his friend Mr. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7886.56s)]
*  Dragonetti. And like they were friends till their very old age. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7895.56s)]
*  And, you know, they had this experience together, this horrible experience. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7901.56s)]
*  But like, you know, not to like ramble on unless you want to hear more about it. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7908.56s)]
*  Like I'm just so amazed at that sacrifice and courage and bravery and just fortune to survive and then have a life after that. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7911.56s)]
*  And then I think about somebody posting their fucking video about working too long at Starbucks. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7922.56s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck you. I'm sorry. Fuck your fucking feelings. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7928.56s)]
*  You're going to be fine. You know, people are very soft. They are. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7933.56s)]
*  But there's that expression. I love to repeat it, that the worst thing that's ever happened to you is the worst thing that's ever happened to you. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7940.56s)]
*  Yes. Yes. And it seems like micro transgressions are a big deal if that's all you're experiencing. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7947.56s)]
*  Yeah. But if you've been through a horrible life experience like your grandfather did, you'd have a completely different perspective about what's important in life. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7954.56s)]
*  Because that would be like the worst thing you could possibly imagine. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7964.56s)]
*  It's just like most people's we are very fortunate to live the way we live now. Correct. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7969.56s)]
*  Most of our interactions with other people are peaceful. That's so rare in human history. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7974.56s)]
*  You know, I used to feel really strongly about and I still feel like this to a degree, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7980.56s)]
*  but I used to feel really strongly about other people's experiences being really difficult for them. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7987.56s)]
*  Like what's the worst for you is the worst for you. Right. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7992.56s)]
*  And being like, man, that must be really hard for you. I'm really sorry. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7994.56s)]
*  Not sorry, but like, I don't think that's a big deal, but it's a big deal for you or whoever you are. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=7997.56s)]
*  And like, but at this point, like the reckless, flagrant emotions and encouragement to be soft and not like grow from your journey and learn from your suffering, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8003.56s)]
*  the encouragement to exploit your suffering is so foul to me. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8017.56s)]
*  You know, like there's a way through. It's not that. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8022.56s)]
*  And like, I understand that those moments like the video I was just talking about where someone's having a hard day and complaining about, you know, their limited skill set in life, emotionally speaking. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8026.56s)]
*  I kind of lost my empathy for that kind of thing. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8041.56s)]
*  Like I just like we should know better than that. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8046.56s)]
*  Everybody's having a hard time. Everybody's working. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8050.56s)]
*  The problem is social media, because that would be a normal thing that a person would do. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8053.56s)]
*  Sure. Like, fuck these hours at Starbucks and you would tell your friend. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8057.56s)]
*  But now you're telling your friend on TikTok. Right. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8061.56s)]
*  And you're tagging people and people share it because it's ridiculous. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8063.56s)]
*  Well, it becomes this convoluted thing that is very influential and and discouraging in terms of like finding the way through. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8068.56s)]
*  Yeah. So, OK, what are you going to do? You're going to not work as much and then you're not going to have as much money and you're not going to be able to take care of yourself. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8077.56s)]
*  What does that mean? Yeah, what does that mean? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8083.56s)]
*  It's so on its head. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8088.56s)]
*  But the worst thing that could happen is that something would shake us out of it. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8093.56s)]
*  The worst thing that could happen was like a world event would shake us out of it. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8099.56s)]
*  Nuclear war? Yeah, like a nuclear war. Like no bullshit. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8103.56s)]
*  Like that's so possible right now. It's so possible. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8106.56s)]
*  It's more possible than it has ever been in our lifetimes since the Cold War. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8110.56s)]
*  There's so many different ways it's going to happen. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8114.56s)]
*  You know, yeah. And and all of it is fucking super sketchy. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8117.56s)]
*  All of it is. It's so it fills you with anxiety because you feel completely powerless to these world events that are going on. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8123.56s)]
*  Well, you're not powerless. Like the best thing you can do is what you're doing. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8130.56s)]
*  Keep making comedy and like keep making music like that's the best you can do. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8134.56s)]
*  And also, P.S., you are like you're one of the best ones for the platform for getting people informed and or inspiring people and just hanging out with your friends. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8140.56s)]
*  Like you have the whole one stop shop. So technically you're doing a lot. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8152.56s)]
*  Me, I'm just writing songs in the basement. You're doing a lot when you're on here. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8157.56s)]
*  But it's not even doing a lot. It's like what most people would be doing. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8161.56s)]
*  I think you just talk to each other. You know, the beautiful thing about being able to do this show is just being able to do it. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8164.56s)]
*  Being able to do this show is just to be able to talk to people, all sorts of different people. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8169.56s)]
*  I had a farmer on yesterday. Really? It was fucking fascinating. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8172.56s)]
*  Where? Will Harris from White Oaks Pasture. It's in Georgia, right? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8176.56s)]
*  It's a farm in Georgia. It's a regenerative farm. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8180.56s)]
*  He turned it from an industrialized farm into a regenerative farm over 20 years. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8183.56s)]
*  What's it? I don't know what a regenerative farm is. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8189.56s)]
*  The difference between using external herbicides and pesticides and all sorts of shit that makes it much easier to farm, but it's toxic ultimately for the land. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8191.56s)]
*  So he went over the details of why he did what he did, what he learned and how he went from transitioning this family farm that he had inherited, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8202.560000000001s)]
*  which was traditionally the way industrialized farms are working. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8211.560000000001s)]
*  They put all this industrialized fertilizer everywhere and then it gets in the rainwater. It's fucking terrible. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8215.56s)]
*  So they decided to turn it around. It took like 20 years, you said. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8221.56s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And just what it's done to the soil and the way. So everything works in a natural cycle. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8226.56s)]
*  The way he describes it, I think, is like mimicking a natural cycle. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8233.56s)]
*  I mean, that's where we're at. Like nothing is what it like the same salmon you're eating now is not the same salmon from 20 years ago, because we've had like all kinds of farming and it's cross, you know, bread. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8237.56s)]
*  And then so like all the species have changed. They've evolved into whatever they are now. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8250.56s)]
*  And, you know, they're like, I mean, I guess that's the way through. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8254.56s)]
*  Like they also have poly farming. Have you ever heard about that? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8261.56s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Poly face farms is Joel Saliton's place. He's been on the podcast a couple of times. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8263.56s)]
*  Oh, really? Cool. That guy drinks out of troughs where cows drink so he can get the biome for his immune system. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8268.56s)]
*  I wonder how long it took to adapt to that. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8276.56s)]
*  Yo. I mean, was he in the bathroom for like a month or what? [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8279.56s)]
*  What were the hard days? Tell me what the hard days were, Joel. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8282.56s)]
*  I would imagine you would have diarrhea. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8286.56s)]
*  I don't have a butthole anymore. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8289.56s)]
*  You would want to send a raven with that diarrhea story. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8290.56s)]
*  You're going to put a scroll on a raven's foot. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8298.56s)]
*  That was my first thought. I was like, that guy was in the bathroom for at least four weeks. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8301.56s)]
*  Forever. What kind of diarrhea does that give you? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8304.56s)]
*  Oh my God, he's drinking water that the cows drink out of. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8310.56s)]
*  I mean, you're going to get some parasites. Actually, that sounds pretty, pretty. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8314.56s)]
*  He was one of the first guys that was completely dismissive of COVID in that way. He wasn't worried about it at all. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8318.56s)]
*  He's like, I take care of my immune system and he supplements his immune system. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8324.56s)]
*  Doesn't sound surprising. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8327.56s)]
*  But what if he's right? What if he's right? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8329.56s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing about little kids you'll see, like when they're really little, especially, they touch everything. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8332.56s)]
*  They put everything in their mouth. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8338.56s)]
*  It's like it's almost like they're trying to do that. They're trying to like medicate themselves to the world. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8340.56s)]
*  But just naturally? [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8346.56s)]
*  I think it's natural. I think it must be because they're exposing themselves to dirt and grime. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8347.56s)]
*  And the more kids, when kids do that, I wonder, my question would be like, is keeping them sanitary bad for their immune system? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8354.56s)]
*  And is keeping them, like letting them put whatever in their mouth dangerous to them because some things are toxic? [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8362.56s)]
*  What's the fine line? [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8369.56s)]
*  I think it's overcorrection with sanitizing and also it's both. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8370.56s)]
*  It's both, right? [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8374.56s)]
*  Because you have to factor in the like superbugs that have formed from all of our antibiotics and our antibiotic resistance. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8375.56s)]
*  Dude, right when I was starting to relax, you got to hit me with superbugs. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8382.56s)]
*  Shit. Okay, let's go back. Let's keep talking about... [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8385.56s)]
*  That stuff is terrifying. Like MRSA? Medication resistance staff? [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8388.56s)]
*  I was paddle boarding on Lady Bird Lake and I like fell in hard. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8394.56s)]
*  Like all this water went up my nose and I was like, I hope I don't get an amoeba. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8398.56s)]
*  For like two days I was like, keep me on amoeba watch. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8403.56s)]
*  Dude, people get amoebas. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8407.56s)]
*  I know. I know. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8408.56s)]
*  They get brain parasites. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8409.56s)]
*  Look, but we're here now, okay? And like so far I'm pretty sure my brain doesn't have a parasite. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8411.56s)]
*  Pretty sure, but you know, only time will tell. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8416.56s)]
*  I've had several friends that got parasites overseas. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8420.56s)]
*  Well, I'm actually like I'm doing a four month parasite cleanse. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8423.56s)]
*  And you don't have to change your diet. It's supplements you take and the friends... [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8428.56s)]
*  Shouldn't you check to see if you actually have a parasite first? [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8433.56s)]
*  So it's also a heavy metal detox. It's kind of a bunch of things and that's a side to it. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8436.56s)]
*  Is all that stuff real? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8442.56s)]
*  So my very dear friends that have done this have told me about the parasites that came out of their body in month two or three. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8444.56s)]
*  Can you do... Is a heavy metal detox, is that a real thing? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8453.56s)]
*  Can you do that? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8456.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8457.56s)]
*  Is that possible? What do you do? Is that a real thing, Jamie? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8458.56s)]
*  What do I do for it? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8461.56s)]
*  No, what can anybody do? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8462.56s)]
*  There's a joke in here. Heavy metal detox. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8463.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8466.56s)]
*  Start listening to Sade. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8467.56s)]
*  I had arsenic in my system at one point in time. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8469.56s)]
*  Okay, I'm sure. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8471.56s)]
*  I was eating too many sardines. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8472.56s)]
*  What, really? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8473.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8474.56s)]
*  How many sardines were you eating, Joe? [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8475.56s)]
*  I was eating a lot. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8476.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8477.56s)]
*  I was eating cans of them a day. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8478.56s)]
*  That's too many. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8480.56s)]
*  I know. And so the guy could... That easily could be it. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8481.56s)]
*  Because it was like trace amounts. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8484.56s)]
*  Were you married at this point? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8486.56s)]
*  No. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8487.56s)]
*  Because I was like, how much make an hour are you doing? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8488.56s)]
*  It was just eating sardines. They're living in pollution. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8490.56s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8495.56s)]
*  So they're at the bottom of the water. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8496.56s)]
*  Okay. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8497.56s)]
*  And that's where all the heavy metals and stuff, I guess, sit. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8498.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, like I said, we were talking about your farmer friend who was on yesterday. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8501.56s)]
*  The whole ecosystem and landscape is fucked, whether it's from pesticides and that kind of thing or mining. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8506.56s)]
*  I was fly fishing on the Clark Fork River in Montana. It was beautiful. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8514.56s)]
*  No-cell service, ospreys, eagles, all of it. You name it. Gorgeous, pristine. Not a piece of trash for miles. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8520.56s)]
*  But you can't eat the fish in the river because of these mines that were leaking in the 80s that were like all kinds of mercury. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8528.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's mercury, but like whatever they were leaking has infected the entire river and you cannot eat the fish. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8536.56s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8541.56s)]
*  But you wouldn't know it looking at it. It doesn't look polluted. It doesn't look like trash. It's just... [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8542.56s)]
*  Do you really need to do a parasite cleanse? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8548.56s)]
*  Uh-oh, are you going to call me out? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8549.56s)]
*  It's highly unlikely that you have intestinal parasites. But even if you do, a home remedy won't do much. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8550.56s)]
*  Well, I'll keep you posted. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8558.56s)]
*  Consumer Reports from July. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8562.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8564.56s)]
*  Oh, that's recently. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8565.56s)]
*  That might be horse shit. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8566.56s)]
*  Fuck! It was expensive. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8568.56s)]
*  The thing is, it's like if you actually do have a parasite, then there's like very specific medication you should take. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8570.56s)]
*  Here's the story. So during our fearful COVID all the shit, not this September, but 2021, I had some touring to do. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8579.56s)]
*  And a friend of mine with their very fancy doctor in Hollywood, like top of the top, asked about, hey, do you have any preventative COVID measures? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8590.56s)]
*  And also if we get COVID, you know, what should we take? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8601.56s)]
*  And so I'd been having stomach issues for a really long time and Ways Too Well helped me discover that I had a bacteria called H. pylori. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8606.56s)]
*  So I had to take antibiotics and I tried the natural stuff and then finally I kicked it, but I still was like sick for a while. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8614.56s)]
*  What causes that? [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8622.56s)]
*  It's like a bacteria that like we have staph and we have all the stuff and some of our immune systems just like get overtaken by it. And I was one of them. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8624.56s)]
*  I was one of them. So I mean, I was sick for like a year. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8633.56s)]
*  My stomach hurt. I got to a point where I was just drinking broth. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8636.56s)]
*  Like that was and even then, like I was just uncomfortable. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8640.56s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8642.56s)]
*  Elio co Bacter pylori H. pylori. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8646.56s)]
*  H. pylori infection occurs when H. pylori bacteria infects your stomach. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8649.56s)]
*  This usually happens during childhood. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8653.56s)]
*  A common cause of stomach ulcers, peptic ulcers. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8655.56s)]
*  Playing with that dirt. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8658.56s)]
*  Wow. That's the downside, right? [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8659.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8661.56s)]
*  Infection may present in more than half the people in the world. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8662.56s)]
*  Most people don't realize they have H. pylori infection because they never get sick from it. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8666.56s)]
*  Well, you get heartburn. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8671.56s)]
*  Signs or symptoms of a peptic ulcer. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8672.56s)]
*  Your health care provider will probably test you for H. pylori infection. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8675.56s)]
*  A peptic ulcer is a sore of the lining of the stomach gastric ulcer or the or the first part of the small intestine. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8678.56s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8687.56s)]
*  So you could be just walking around with that. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8689.56s)]
*  I have no idea you have it. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8691.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8692.56s)]
*  And supposedly it's contagious, but who knows? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8693.56s)]
*  Like our immune systems fight stuff off all the time. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8695.56s)]
*  But so I was really sick. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8698.56s)]
*  Waste a well. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8700.56s)]
*  Another shout out. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8702.56s)]
*  Help me get my like they figured out because I was deficient in all these vitamins that I took every day. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8703.56s)]
*  And they're like, there's a reason your body is not absorbing all these things you're taking. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8710.56s)]
*  So let's do run this test, this test. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8714.56s)]
*  So then I kicked the H. pylori, but I was still uncomfortable for a while and I was like, fuck, my stomach hurts all the time. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8716.56s)]
*  And so the fancy doctor in L.A. recommended COVID preventative, ivermectin and heparin, which is a blood thinning nasal spray because COVID is a blood clotting virus. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8723.56s)]
*  So I take the nasal spray. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8737.56s)]
*  I mean, I was around thousands of people and I hug everybody. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8739.56s)]
*  Like I am very present in the physical world and I didn't get COVID, but I took the ivermectin and my stomach stuff went away and it was like I'd never felt better. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8743.56s)]
*  So maybe I had a parasite because, you know, ivermectin is a is a anti parasitic. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8757.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the main use of it. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8764.56s)]
*  Correct. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8766.56s)]
*  And whatever it was, it was like a miracle. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8767.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8772.56s)]
*  Because after that I was like, whoa, I felt so good. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8773.56s)]
*  But, you know, I like apparently have these intolerances stuff I'm working on, but it's fascinating. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8777.56s)]
*  You know, well, that's not like you had an infection. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8785.56s)]
*  I did. I did. I was sick. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8787.56s)]
*  That is a wild thing. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8789.56s)]
*  That's like an invading army attacking your defense systems. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8791.56s)]
*  It was really scary. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8795.56s)]
*  I felt like alien. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8797.56s)]
*  I was bummed. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8799.56s)]
*  It's like you've got a little war going on in your body. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8801.56s)]
*  Kind of. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8803.56s)]
*  Like that's what staph is like. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8805.56s)]
*  Staph is like you have a little, you get a staph infection, like you got a war going on. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8807.56s)]
*  Have you had a staph infection? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8811.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8812.56s)]
*  Really? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8813.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8814.56s)]
*  Scary. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8815.56s)]
*  It's a common occurrence with grappling because you get scratched and, you know, you're rolling around and choking each other and shit. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8816.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8823.56s)]
*  And you'll like see something on your shin. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8824.56s)]
*  What is that? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8826.56s)]
*  That would make sense why you have the superbug fear because, you know, like physical contact and all that stuff. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8827.56s)]
*  Well, I don't have the superbug fear. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8833.56s)]
*  I just have a, I did a show with Duncan back in the day where we went to the Center for Disease Control in Galveston and they were explaining us the. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8835.56s)]
*  The Center for Disease Control. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8845.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8847.56s)]
*  V1. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8848.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8849.56s)]
*  Is in Galveston. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8850.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8851.56s)]
*  And it's. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8852.56s)]
*  What did you think of Galveston? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8853.56s)]
*  I think it's the Center for Disease Control. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8854.56s)]
*  Whoever works on the viruses. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8855.56s)]
*  It's the Galveston National Laboratory, a bio defense lab. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8858.56s)]
*  Bio defense lab. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8862.56s)]
*  So we go down there and they're explaining to us that what they're really concerned about is not like man-made viruses. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8863.56s)]
*  What they're really concerned about is like something just jumping from animals to people that's like super deadly. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8871.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8877.56s)]
*  Like the Black Plague, like the Spanish Flu, like, you know, like there's there's some that are just walloping where they kill like, you know, a giant swath of people. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8878.56s)]
*  The microscopic world. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8888.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8889.56s)]
*  And it's like we're always like constantly trying to work to prevent that from happening. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8890.56s)]
*  And that's when you get the scope of it. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8894.56s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, like this is like at any moment in time, nature could just throw us the wildest curve ball. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8895.56s)]
*  And especially when you incorporate like what happens with animal agriculture, where a lot of the viruses develop and do jump from people. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8901.56s)]
*  Well, and we we've fucked with nature so much like manipulating science in this way that it feels, I don't know. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8909.56s)]
*  I don't like to doomsday. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8918.56s)]
*  I'm like, I want to enjoy my time. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8920.56s)]
*  But it's scary. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8924.56s)]
*  And I'm not necessarily doomsday. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8925.56s)]
*  But I am saying like, like, we've got to look at this thing like this is what we're doing is wild. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8928.56s)]
*  We're having a little battle with nature. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8934.56s)]
*  We're trying to trick it and bottle it up and make antibiotics. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8936.56s)]
*  You hunt. You're out there. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8941.56s)]
*  Right. Like a while ago, like a long time ago, I tried to surf when I lived in Venice Beach. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8943.56s)]
*  And I remember being out there and just being in the ocean in this like this thing could end me like that. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8950.56s)]
*  Like not just from the monsters in there, but like it's just sheer brute force. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8958.56s)]
*  And like we are like nothing. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8964.56s)]
*  You can just flick us off. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8966.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like and so with that said, like much respect. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8968.56s)]
*  Much respect. Much respect. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8973.56s)]
*  Much respect surfers. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8976.56s)]
*  No, I mean, like the force of our planet and like, you know, Mother Gaia, whatever you want to call it. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8978.56s)]
*  Like it's it and it'll it'll let you know. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8985.56s)]
*  Oh, easy. And it's doing nothing. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8987.56s)]
*  It's not even trying. It's not even trying. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8989.56s)]
*  And just a little bit of undertow and you're like, oh, shit, I can't get back to the shore. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8991.56s)]
*  We watched Armageddon the other day. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8995.56s)]
*  Other 90s throwback. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8997.56s)]
*  And I mean, how do you not think like that could happen? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=8999.56s)]
*  This could happen. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9004.56s)]
*  It's 100 percent gonna happen. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9005.56s)]
*  It's happened so many times. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9006.56s)]
*  It's already happened. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9007.56s)]
*  It's happened so many times. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9008.56s)]
*  There's always there was one that we're just talking about recently in the news that you can watch this giant comet whiz by Earth soon. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9010.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think Nick and I were dating for like two weeks when we like I mean, we were just so in love. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9017.56s)]
*  Like we just kind of had that like I see you moment like we knew we knew Avatar. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9023.56s)]
*  And I told him I was like, I'm going to be staring into your eyes when the end of the world comes. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9027.56s)]
*  You know, I almost want to be like right there doing that. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9035.56s)]
*  Like you don't want to be a survivor. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9038.56s)]
*  I thought about that too. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9040.56s)]
*  Leave that to heartier folk. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9042.56s)]
*  Like the part of me like I'm not trying to sound egotistical. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9043.56s)]
*  There's a part of me that feels like I'm going to be one of the last ones standing, but I don't want to be. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9047.56s)]
*  I don't want that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9052.56s)]
*  Of course. Everybody feels like that. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9053.56s)]
*  I don't want it. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9054.56s)]
*  I feel like if if something happens like that, we will be knocked so far back into the past so quickly that you almost don't want to be alive for it because it's going to take so long for people to figure out civilization again. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9055.56s)]
*  And I think that's happened a fuckload of times. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9069.56s)]
*  Kids, I am having Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson come on the podcast this month to talk about that very thing. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9072.56s)]
*  These guys have been studying this for fucking decades and their two coinciding theories about what happened seem to be based on this thing called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, where they think somewhere around 12,000 years ago we got hit by comets and that there was a very advanced civilization before that and it got wiped out. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9080.56s)]
*  And so everything that we see from like 6,000 years ago, like Babylonia and like the Sumerian texts and all that stuff, all that stuff is coming from people reinventing things thousands of years later. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9103.56s)]
*  So this is like 6,000 years after the impact. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9115.56s)]
*  So if there's 12,000 years ago, we get pelted by giant rocks and then we do they do core samples, they go down 12,000 years and they find this high level of iridium, which is really common in space and really rare on Earth. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9119.56s)]
*  And it usually signifies an asteroid impact and they find that shit all over at 12,000 years. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9133.56s)]
*  So when they get to this point, it's almost like there's irrefutable evidence that something happened and that something was so big that it might have reset civilization. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9141.56s)]
*  We might have been human beings might have been really advanced at one point in time, like really advanced. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9150.56s)]
*  If you see what they did in Egypt and you realize that at the earliest that was 4,000, 5,000 years ago at the earliest. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9156.56s)]
*  But it might have been way earlier than that. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9166.56s)]
*  That stuff might have been a remnant of an ancient civilization that was far more advanced than we are right now. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9169.56s)]
*  It just got knocked into the Stone Age. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9176.56s)]
*  We just don't think that can happen. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9178.56s)]
*  But fuck it could happen. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9180.56s)]
*  Yeah, for sure it could happen. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9182.56s)]
*  Well, I think there's this weird immortality that comes with the vapid lifestyle of technology and the way that people forget the depths of existence and then therefore forget how finite we are. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9184.56s)]
*  And I mean, that's like, I mean, you kind of get to the like God place there. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9200.56s)]
*  You know, there's this like I feel so sad for people that don't dig into themselves and dig into this stuff and think about the enormity of our existence and like your life is so short. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9206.56s)]
*  It goes so fast. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9226.56s)]
*  And, you know, you're you're missing from your negligence to ground yourself like you're missing it with your self importance. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9228.56s)]
*  You're missing it with your narcissism. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9240.56s)]
*  Yeah. And you're this like this is not the world like it's so sad to me. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9242.56s)]
*  And I think like in terms of what you're talking about, there's like this really fine line between that scientific and theoretical idea of, you know, intelligent life before us and knowing that like we were given this chance and we're fucking it up. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9249.56s)]
*  But we're not necessarily fucking it up. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9269.56s)]
*  I think it's just a process. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9272.56s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9274.56s)]
*  I don't think we're fucking it up. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9275.56s)]
*  I think there's a process. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9277.56s)]
*  I don't mean to sound negative. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9278.56s)]
*  No, no, you're not. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9279.56s)]
*  You're recognizing real problems. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9280.56s)]
*  Well, I'm looking at the world around me because I'm actually like an optimist eternally. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9282.56s)]
*  Like I'm such a like here's where the sunshine is. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9287.56s)]
*  Like this is where it's beautiful. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9290.56s)]
*  This is where things are good. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9292.56s)]
*  Like let's get there. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9293.56s)]
*  Like we can do this. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9294.56s)]
*  And then I just look at the amount of people that value Kim Kardashian's plastic surgery, you know, or whatever it is. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9295.56s)]
*  You're you're obsessing over that you think is valuable. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9308.56s)]
*  Like that stuff is very sad to me. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9311.56s)]
*  And well, it's because we're not faced with big threats. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9314.56s)]
*  When you face a big threat, you focus on trivial things. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9317.56s)]
*  When something big happens, that's when everybody puts the American flag on their car. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9320.56s)]
*  All the stuff that's happening big. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9324.56s)]
*  It is, but it's not big enough. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9326.56s)]
*  The new cycle so fucked, the new cycle so fucked that every day there's like 15 new outrages and five new conspiracy theories. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9328.56s)]
*  And then there's a new crime and then there's a new mass shooting and then there's a car accident and there's a plane crash. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9336.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9341.56s)]
*  And it's just constant. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9342.56s)]
*  But you're getting battered by information. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9344.56s)]
*  So even like the Ukraine Russia thing, people like boring, done with it over 200 days, you know, and then they have their narratives. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9347.56s)]
*  You know, Ukraine's winning. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9356.56s)]
*  No, Russia's holding off till the winter. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9357.56s)]
*  Like it's all it's almost like they're fucking calling a sport. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9360.56s)]
*  But they say it like we actually know what's going on. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9364.56s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9366.56s)]
*  I don't either. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9367.56s)]
*  And I mean, I'm sure we're getting some correct information. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9369.56s)]
*  I'm not discarding the information. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9372.56s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm not totally aware. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9374.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you also factor in wag the dog, you know, like you factor in the technological manipulation like you can make anything look like anything. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9376.56s)]
*  Do you think they've actually gone to that? [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9387.56s)]
*  Do you think like there's governments that have actually made videos? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9389.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9392.56s)]
*  Let's not say America, because of course we wouldn't do that. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9393.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9395.56s)]
*  But for sure, there's got to be some news footage. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9396.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9399.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9400.56s)]
*  It's been proven. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9401.56s)]
*  It's been proven. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9402.56s)]
*  It's been proven. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9403.56s)]
*  At the beginning of the Ukraine War, wasn't there a video that was going around? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9404.56s)]
*  It was like a viral video and people like, you know, look, the jet got shot down in Ukraine and people found out it's actually a scene from a video game. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9407.56s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9415.56s)]
*  Isn't that true, Jamie? [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9416.56s)]
*  What was that story? [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9417.56s)]
*  The minute actors. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9418.56s)]
*  Exactly what you said, I believe. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9419.56s)]
*  I was about to pull it up if you didn't say it. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9421.56s)]
*  Did someone do it as a goof or was it like? [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9423.56s)]
*  That would be way too hard to know without digging way deep who did that and why they did it. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9426.56s)]
*  But like the ghost of Kiev was like the ace shooting down everyone. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9431.56s)]
*  But that's how susceptible everyone is to this shit. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9436.56s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9439.56s)]
*  Like, I don't know what's real. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9440.56s)]
*  But I do know it's really fucked up when actors are flying over to the Ukraine and talking like they know what's going on and promoting something. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9442.56s)]

*  and I want to tell everybody about it. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9595.56s)]
*  Guess what? [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9597.56s)]
*  Like, this is the, like, Carl Jung. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9598.56s)]
*  But it is a factor in it. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9600.56s)]
*  Sure, but... [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9602.56s)]
*  Right? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9603.56s)]

*  learn from people that did it. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9621.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9622.56s)]

*  That's the secret. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9624.56s)]
*  That's the secret. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9625.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9626.56s)]
*  You know, learn from... [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9627.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9628.56s)]
*  You talk to them, you go, [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9629.56s)]
*  oh, Suzanne's a regular human [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9630.56s)]
*  and she figured out how to be a professional musician. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9631.56s)]
*  How the fuck can I do that? [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9633.56s)]
*  Talk to that. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9634.56s)]
*  That's the secret. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9635.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm still figuring it out still. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9636.56s)]
*  But, you know, you know what you're doing. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9639.56s)]
*  It's not... [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9644.56s)]
*  If I was a kid and I believed that I could manifest everything [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9649.56s)]
*  just with my mind, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9652.56s)]
*  I didn't know that there was, like, [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9654.56s)]
*  significant amount of work involved. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9655.56s)]
*  Most kids believe that now. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9657.56s)]
*  That's such a crippling mentality. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9660.56s)]
*  It is. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9663.56s)]
*  Like, one of the things about being a teenager in Boston [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9664.56s)]
*  was that Massachusetts is so hardcore work ethic. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9669.56s)]
*  Those fucking people work. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9674.56s)]
*  And one of the reasons why is because you have to shovel snow [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9676.56s)]
*  for many months of the year. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9679.56s)]
*  You're doing real hard labor at your fucking house. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9681.56s)]
*  You've got to scrape your windshield out, yeah. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9683.56s)]
*  Do you know how many people have blown their back out [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9685.56s)]
*  shoveling their fucking driveway? [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9687.56s)]
*  Me. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9688.56s)]
*  I've done it. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9689.56s)]
*  A lot. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9690.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9691.56s)]
*  People get slipped. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9692.56s)]
*  As a teenager. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9693.56s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9694.56s)]
*  It's so much work. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9695.56s)]
*  To go from no work to that, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9696.56s)]
*  well, if you don't do that, you don't get out. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9697.56s)]
*  You know? [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9698.56s)]
*  And if you don't do it soon, it becomes ice. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9699.56s)]
*  That's a great analogy. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9701.56s)]
*  There's a part of surviving a thing that happens every year. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9702.56s)]
*  Like, the winters in Boston are fucking harsh. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9706.56s)]
*  They're harsh. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9711.56s)]
*  Believe them too. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9712.56s)]
*  And you get that water off the ocean, [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9713.56s)]
*  so you get that salt water cold that just cuts through your fucking bones. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9716.56s)]
*  It cuts right through you. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9720.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9721.56s)]
*  You lose your breath. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9722.56s)]
*  You can't even breathe. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9723.56s)]
*  It's so cold. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9724.56s)]
*  It's fucking cold. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9726.56s)]
*  And it's going to happen every year. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9727.56s)]
*  And you're going to get ice, [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9730.56s)]
*  and you're going to get black ice on the roads where it rains first. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9731.56s)]
*  And then the whole road is a fucking ice skating rink. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9734.56s)]
*  And you have to know how to drive on it. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9737.56s)]
*  I love it. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9738.56s)]
*  I'm a winter baby. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9739.56s)]
*  I love it. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9740.56s)]
*  It's real. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9741.56s)]
*  It's a different kind of person. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9742.56s)]
*  I know. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9743.56s)]
*  Those are some of my favorite people that come from winter places. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9744.56s)]
*  I'm not bullshitting. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9746.56s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9747.56s)]
*  Because I think California is like being a trust fund baby, weather-wise. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9748.56s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9753.56s)]
*  Like, everything's fine. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9754.56s)]
*  It's always fine. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9755.56s)]
*  You don't have to work that hard. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9756.56s)]
*  And when it is raining, like, oh my god, it's raining again. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9757.56s)]
*  Like, bitch, it's raining three days this year. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9759.56s)]
*  Fuck are you saying? [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9762.56s)]
*  I'm losing my tan. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9763.56s)]
*  They're so accustomed to that that it really does fuck with your character development. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9764.56s)]
*  Sure. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9770.56s)]
*  It doesn't limit you. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9771.56s)]
*  You can still develop a great character doing other stuff and difficult things, [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9772.56s)]
*  but you're not going to get that one essential thing out of nature. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9775.56s)]
*  I think this speaks to mutual aversion to the softies. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9777.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9781.56s)]
*  You just, you got to fucking toughen up. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9782.56s)]
*  But you can't toughen up if you don't know what they're doing. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9783.56s)]
*  Like, you don't know what that means. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9785.56s)]
*  For yourself, not just for us, but for yourself. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9786.56s)]
*  Sure. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9789.56s)]
*  Like, you have to. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9790.56s)]
*  It's important for everybody. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9791.56s)]
*  But like, to like kind of spiral back to things we were talking about before, [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9792.56s)]
*  like, they can't do that if they don't know what that feels like. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9796.56s)]
*  You don't know what that means. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9800.56s)]
*  And, you know, the proverbial cold within us, you know? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9802.56s)]
*  Like, you have to know how to weather a storm. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9808.56s)]
*  If you've never been through a real storm, then how would you know? [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9811.56s)]
*  It's humbling. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9814.56s)]
*  When everyone's stranded at home and you look out the window and all you see is white. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9815.56s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9820.56s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9821.56s)]
*  And it's so quiet. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9822.56s)]
*  But you have to go in, too. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9823.56s)]
*  You have to sit with yourself. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9824.56s)]
*  You can't play outside. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9825.56s)]
*  I'm an outdoor kid. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9826.56s)]
*  You can't do that shit. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9827.56s)]
*  You know? [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9828.56s)]
*  A lot of times the power goes out. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9829.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9830.56s)]
*  Power goes out a lot. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9831.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9832.56s)]
*  Everybody's huddled around with candles and shit. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9833.56s)]
*  Like, I had, you have to have gear, too. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9834.56s)]
*  You have to have snow pants and boots and all that stuff. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9836.56s)]
*  You have to have boots. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9839.56s)]
*  You can't be going out there with sneakers. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9840.56s)]
*  You fucking idiot. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9841.56s)]
*  You're going to freeze to death. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9842.56s)]
*  You're going to lose a foot. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9843.56s)]
*  I have been to many a Browns game in Cleveland. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9844.56s)]
*  Oh, huddled. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9847.56s)]
*  You have those little things. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9848.56s)]
*  You smack those warmers you put in your boots. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9851.56s)]
*  And then you lose again. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9854.56s)]
*  You have to sit with the sinking feeling of defeat. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9859.56s)]
*  While you're freezing your dick off. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9864.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9866.56s)]
*  Cold weather people are different fucking people. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9867.56s)]
*  They really are. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9871.56s)]
*  That's like why Canadians are so hearty. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9872.56s)]
*  Oh. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9875.56s)]
*  Those motherfuckers have to deal with cold. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9876.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9878.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9879.56s)]
*  Jamie, you know. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9880.56s)]
*  I just feel like people that have to go through shit like that together. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9881.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9884.56s)]
*  There's like a bonding experience in surviving the winter. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9885.56s)]
*  And the only reason all these humans can survive the winter is because people are smart enough to figure out shelters. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9888.56s)]
*  Like, you can't be homeless there. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9893.56s)]
*  Like, that is like right there with that weather. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9895.56s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9898.56s)]
*  You know. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9899.56s)]
*  From all the exciting things I've got to do in my life and places I've lived, still to this day, whenever I go home to Cleveland, I am met and confronted with the most interesting, humbled, fascinating, funniest, salt of the earth kind of people. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9900.56s)]
*  Real people. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9918.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9920.56s)]
*  They have to deal with real shit. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9921.56s)]
*  But, you know, lacking a precious thing. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9922.56s)]
*  Like, they're just like, hey, cheers. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9925.56s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9928.56s)]
*  You know. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9929.56s)]
*  But I... [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9930.56s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of disillusioning kind of places like New York and L.A. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9932.56s)]
*  Like, there are these meccas of art and culture. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9937.56s)]
*  But then, you know, they've kind of been overrun by ideologies that can be damaging. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9941.56s)]
*  And... [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9950.56s)]
*  But you can't say that about Boston or Cleveland or, you know, sort of... [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9951.56s)]
*  I mean, I guess you could. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9956.56s)]
*  Boston's a little different. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9957.56s)]
*  Boston's pretty liberal. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9958.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9959.56s)]
*  It's a lot different than... [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9960.56s)]
*  Maybe they're hardier liberals, though. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9961.56s)]
*  Hardie's a good... [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9963.56s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9965.56s)]
*  I'm kind of like babbling right now. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9966.56s)]
*  But Hardie is a good word for it. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9968.56s)]
*  You have to overcome nature if you live in a cold climate. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9971.56s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9975.56s)]
*  It's a real change of the world. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9976.56s)]
*  It's a psychological and emotional thing that... [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9977.56s)]
*  Wow, that's really well done, man. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9980.56s)]
*  Just like the people that live next to the ocean. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9982.56s)]
*  That feeling that you have in the ocean, the same feeling. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9984.56s)]
*  Sure. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9986.56s)]
*  It's like, you ain't shit. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9987.56s)]
*  Great. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9988.56s)]
*  You ain't shit. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9989.56s)]
*  It snowed out. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9990.56s)]
*  You ain't shit. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9991.56s)]
*  There's the ocean. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9992.56s)]
*  And you have to be smart. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9993.56s)]
*  Like, don't go out there this day. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9994.56s)]
*  Like, don't drive into this blizzard. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9995.56s)]
*  You might fucking die. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9996.56s)]
*  You might fucking die. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9997.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9998.56s)]
*  No one's going to come and rescue you, bitch. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=9999.56s)]
*  No. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10000.56s)]
*  No, you can't. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10001.56s)]
*  They can't get to you. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10002.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10003.56s)]
*  Don't even go out. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10004.56s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10005.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10006.56s)]
*  Those are fucking bonding moments for communities. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10007.56s)]
*  They really are. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10010.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10011.56s)]
*  You're faced with a threat. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10012.56s)]
*  Like, hey, do you guys need anything? [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10013.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10014.56s)]
*  Hey, we got this. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10015.56s)]
*  We got that. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10016.56s)]
*  A hank shot of deer. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10017.56s)]
*  I played in Telluride, Colorado this summer, which is so pretty up there. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10018.56s)]
*  And they have a festival that they have, one of them, and the ride fest. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10024.199999999999s)]
*  And I had this runner who was taking us back down the mountain. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10031.8s)]
*  It's like two hours, an hour and a half, or something like that. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10036.199999999999s)]
*  And he lived in this community that was an hour or so from Telluride. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10039.0s)]
*  And he was telling me about all their septic stuff and electricity even. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10044.16s)]
*  And they all had to take care of each other. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10050.0s)]
*  He lived in this small little town that if something went wrong, it went wrong for everyone. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10051.48s)]
*  And they had to like, hey, what tools do you need? [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10057.32s)]
*  How do you want to get through this? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10062.039999999999s)]
*  And I mean, it's really funny. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10063.88s)]
*  You know, you don't know until you've lived something like that. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10071.4s)]
*  Like, you don't know until you've had those like really scary storms or winters where [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10075.24s)]
*  you really do need to help each other. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10079.64s)]
*  And then it becomes very logical. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10081.74s)]
*  And we're very sheltered from that. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10085.759999999998s)]
*  Most places don't have those experiences. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10089.98s)]
*  Because you don't need to advertise it. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10093.56s)]
*  It's just how you live. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10094.96s)]
*  It's just how you live. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10096.76s)]
*  And it makes a stronger human, more resilient human. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10097.76s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10101.8s)]
*  I think it's a part of the problem with living in Los Angeles. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10102.8s)]
*  There's so many factors that make living in Los Angeles fucked. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10105.08s)]
*  There's the sheer number of people, which of course also equals a sheer number of a [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10107.56s)]
*  lot of really interesting people. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10113.0s)]
*  It's a lot of cool people there, no doubt. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10115.599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's very beguiling. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10117.8s)]
*  A lot of restaurants and great things. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10118.8s)]
*  It's a beautiful place. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10120.279999999999s)]
*  Yes, beautiful place. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10121.28s)]
*  But you got a lot of fucking people. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10122.28s)]
*  There's so many. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10125.84s)]
*  There's so many. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10128.2s)]
*  Well, and then you have to factor in like the people that have like exploded from YouTube [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10129.2s)]
*  or something like really easy that didn't involve. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10135.52s)]
*  That's toxin to all those people that have been working hard and haven't made it. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10139.640000000001s)]
*  You motherfuckers. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10143.2s)]
*  It's toxic. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10144.2s)]
*  I'm of the mindset of like whatever propagates joy, but to the extent of it being valuable [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10146.12s)]
*  joy and like with depth, you know, not like a cheap thrill. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10156.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10161.68s)]
*  It doesn't have to be though. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10163.12s)]
*  You know, like the thing about all these things is they're attracting people and why are they [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10165.36s)]
*  attracting me? [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10171.16s)]
*  There's a lot of dumb shit that's attracting me. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10172.16s)]
*  It's still getting me. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10173.84s)]
*  I'm still watching dumb shit. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10175.48s)]
*  Yeah, but you know better. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10176.880000000001s)]
*  Like you do. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10178.52s)]
*  Why though? [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10179.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10180.52s)]
*  I mean, you're like, you just watching the dumb shit. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10181.52s)]
*  Yeah, but you how many people come see you perform? [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10182.8s)]
*  You know, like you have to stay up on your intellectual comedy. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10186.56s)]
*  Oh, I have to keep watching dumb shit. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10189.56s)]
*  Well, sure. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10191.960000000001s)]
*  But like the execution of what you've ingested and then the way you deliver through your [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10193.36s)]
*  Your craft involves a specific skill to you. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10200.12s)]
*  You know, you're not asleep at the wheel. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10204.68s)]
*  No, that's not what I'm saying. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10206.320000000002s)]
*  But I do get like I do waste time on nonsense for sure. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10207.480000000001s)]
*  What I was going to get at is that there's all these different factors that are fucked [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10212.400000000001s)]
*  up out LA and that weather thing is a big part of it. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10216.12s)]
*  But another big part of it is that everybody goes there to try to make it. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10219.480000000001s)]
*  And so when you go there, you're trying to get hired for something. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10222.960000000001s)]
*  So you're always kind of putting on this act of who you want people to think you are [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10227.12s)]
*  and they only talk in like a certain ideological lingo. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10231.160000000002s)]
*  It's like very progressive II. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10234.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10236.320000000002s)]
*  You have to factor in that like this like get rich quick because of like being beautiful [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10237.320000000002s)]
*  or like Pam Anderson or something like that sort of gets injected into things. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10241.960000000001s)]
*  But that's been happening for so long. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10246.240000000002s)]
*  But not like now. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10248.36s)]
*  Not like now. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10249.44s)]
*  But now it's ubiquitous. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10250.44s)]
*  Now it's just omnipresent. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10251.44s)]
*  Like you can't. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10252.44s)]
*  Now they're more popular. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10253.44s)]
*  Now it's you get rich for a week and then people forget about you for some of them. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10255.2s)]
*  But then there's people like the Kardashians. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10260.6s)]
*  They got a grip on it. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10262.12s)]
*  But they got in early. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10263.480000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10264.480000000001s)]
*  They started their bullshit a long time ago. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10265.480000000001s)]
*  But there's been some people that like got pretty popular and then people got tired of [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10268.720000000001s)]
*  them. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10271.76s)]
*  I mean, you got it like for whatever they're doing, whatever voodoo the Kardashians have [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10272.76s)]
*  done to the American and the world people. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10277.720000000001s)]
*  They're fucking really good at it. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10280.44s)]
*  People are still watching. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10281.84s)]
*  That's some good voodoo. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10283.800000000001s)]
*  If that's all you're selling. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10285.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10286.4s)]
*  If that's all you're selling is watch me. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10287.4s)]
*  I think what they're selling is immortality at this point. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10288.4s)]
*  Like they're trying to show you how like you can have the same face for so long. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10290.84s)]
*  Madonna selling immortality. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10296.48s)]
*  Oh gosh, it terrifies me. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10297.48s)]

*  I'm wondering when somebody. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10307.199999999999s)]
*  If she really looks like that. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10308.199999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering if anyone cares about her at all. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10309.599999999999s)]
*  I do. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10312.679999999998s)]
*  And call her. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10314.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know her that well at all. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10315.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know her at all. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10317.16s)]
*  But if I did know her at all, I'd say if that's what you really look like, I get it. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10318.16s)]
*  I want to show it off. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10321.839999999998s)]
*  If she has one friend that's like, Hey, I think you need some help. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10323.039999999999s)]
*  No, I'm the wrong friend. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10327.24s)]
*  Cause I'd be like, keep posting. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10328.24s)]
*  I'd be like more pictures. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10329.72s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10331.64s)]
*  Let's go Madonna. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10332.759999999998s)]
*  Where did she, there was one where her was like, she was kind of in her underwear. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10334.08s)]
*  What I'm interested in is like, or not interested in is why do people care who Madonna's fucking? [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10337.56s)]
*  She wants to talk about being gay or whatever. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10344.2s)]
*  Like, like we care. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10346.92s)]
*  Like just go fuck them. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10347.92s)]
*  Go do what you want to do. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10349.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, why do you have to talk about it to everyone? [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10350.28s)]
*  She's maintaining relevance to a certain extent. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10353.04s)]
*  She wants to be a sex symbol and she's the time's passed and like, look, you can do other [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10355.08s)]
*  things but like. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10361.56s)]
*  But does she want to be a sex symbol? [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10362.56s)]
*  Or does she want to be Madonna? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10364.960000000001s)]
*  Is that how she feels alive expressing herself? [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10367.04s)]
*  Listen. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10370.16s)]
*  Having her booty up in the air and having them big titties flop around. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10371.16s)]
*  Like I said, Dolly Parton. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10374.96s)]
*  The image she posted up, if you can't find it, maybe they took it down. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10379.24s)]
*  If she really looks like that, she looks fucking great. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10383.48s)]
*  Who Madonna? [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10386.119999999999s)]
*  Yes, for however old she is. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10387.119999999999s)]
*  I am in strong disagreement. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10388.56s)]
*  Her face scares the shit out of me. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10391.68s)]
*  64. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10393.6s)]
*  Wow. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10394.6s)]
*  I hear that ACDC song right now. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10395.6s)]
*  It's a long way to the top. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10401.84s)]
*  Look, I have appreciated Madonna's contributions to our music and culture, but like there's [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10409.04s)]
*  a time. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10418.6s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10419.6s)]
*  When you gotta hang up your hat and stop putting your boobies in people's faces if they don't [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10422.48s)]
*  want to see them. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10426.279999999999s)]
*  Well, maybe some people do. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10427.279999999999s)]
*  She's obviously got some young fellas that still enjoy them. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10428.56s)]
*  That is a strange fetish that I do not understand. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10431.0s)]
*  Dan Bilzerian of the female Instagram influencer. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10433.68s)]
*  Look at her. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10436.64s)]
*  She looks hot as fuck. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10437.64s)]
*  If that's what she looks like, fuck yeah. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10438.64s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10441.64s)]
*  If you can really look like that at 64, I don't know what glasses I have to put on. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10442.64s)]
*  How doctored is that photo? [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10446.48s)]
*  How doctored? [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10447.48s)]
*  You don't know how smooth that shit looks. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10448.48s)]
*  Stop ruining everything. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10449.48s)]
*  All I need is some they live sunglasses. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10450.48s)]
*  I guarantee some weird puckering in weird places, Joe. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10452.48s)]
*  I guarantee that's the future of AR. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10456.16s)]
*  You're gonna put on glasses and the person that you're with is gonna look as perfect [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10458.76s)]
*  as you need them to be. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10463.18s)]
*  That is so fucked up. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10464.18s)]
*  That's what we're gonna do. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10465.18s)]
*  People are gonna get mad if you only want to have sex with them with the glasses on. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10466.18s)]
*  I want the real thing. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10468.92s)]
*  Yeah, some people are gonna get mad though. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10470.279999999999s)]
*  Take your glasses off, god damn it. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10472.66s)]

*  Who are you really? [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10475.68s)]
*  Who are you fucking in those glasses? [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10478.359999999999s)]
*  I think the guest book, the show I did a while back where Honey Honey, we did the music for [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10481.24s)]
*  it, I think Joey Diaz is in that episode, but there's this episode with, I think it's [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10486.400000000001s)]
*  Heather Donahue, a friend of mine, where her husband has an addiction to VR and they're [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10492.640000000001s)]
*  like having sex with VR gossips and there's this whole story going on where he's somebody [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10498.36s)]
*  and she's somebody but she accidentally kills him. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10502.76s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10506.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10507.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10508.0s)]
*  But I'm sure that happens. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10509.64s)]
*  It's 100% gonna happen if it hasn't happened already. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10510.64s)]
*  If it hasn't happened already, it's 100% gonna happen. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10514.2s)]
*  I kind of feel, that's it. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10517.08s)]
*  Oh that's right, Joey takes over. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10523.08s)]
*  He makes the wrong video. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10539.08s)]
*  Anyway, the outro, I'm pretty sure you'll hear me singing on that episode. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10550.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10554.08s)]
*  Oh my god, it's so ridiculous. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10556.08s)]
*  I mean, Joe, that is some people's reality. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10558.08s)]
*  I think there's gonna be a lot of people in the future that are living life virtually [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10562.08s)]
*  and more than we can even imagine. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10566.16s)]
*  I think it's gonna get so good. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10569.16s)]
*  I think there's also gonna be a lot of people that are bad at sex because they learned through [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10571.16s)]
*  their phones and not through natural discourse of life. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10575.96s)]
*  They think that's already probably fucking up kids' wiring. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10581.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10584.96s)]
*  They're seeing that kind of sex all the time. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10585.96s)]
*  Yeah, porn addictions and stuff, yeah, 100%. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10586.96s)]
*  The whole human internet technology interface situation is so strange to me. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10590.839999999998s)]
*  Because it most definitely enhances our ability to do things. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10599.839999999998s)]
*  But is it, how much of it, it's definitely enhancing your life somewhat. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10603.839999999998s)]
*  It's giving you some interesting entertainment. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10608.839999999998s)]
*  You can listen to a book on tape. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10611.839999999998s)]
*  You can learn stuff from your phone. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10613.839999999998s)]
*  You can ask questions and get answers. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10615.839999999998s)]
*  You have to be able to check yourself. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10617.839999999998s)]
*  There's benefits and there's egregious downsides that can fuck you up. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10620.72s)]
*  You just have to know how to handle yourself. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10624.72s)]
*  It's like handle your booze. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10626.72s)]
*  Handle your booze. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10628.72s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10629.72s)]
*  Because it's all candy in some ways. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10630.72s)]
*  My point is it seems to keep going in the same direction always. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10632.72s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be slowing down. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10636.72s)]
*  It goes into the direction... [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10638.72s)]
*  That's where the nuclear war comes in. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10640.72s)]
*  That's the only thing that's gonna save us. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10642.72s)]
*  I hope not. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10644.72s)]
*  No. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10646.72s)]
*  But it seems like that's where it's going. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10647.72s)]
*  It's going to a deeper infusion into what it is to be a person. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10650.599999999999s)]
*  To a point where it's a part of your body. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10654.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's that far away. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10656.599999999999s)]
*  I think once they do start implementing that, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10658.599999999999s)]
*  it's gonna be so beneficial to the people that have it, [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10660.599999999999s)]
*  that everyone's just gonna jump on board. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10663.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's gonna happen radically. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10665.599999999999s)]
*  And I don't think we're prepared for what the fuck that means. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10667.599999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10670.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's gonna happen in our lifetime. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10672.599999999999s)]
*  Just like when we were kids, there was no internet. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10674.599999999999s)]
*  Now the world's a totally different place. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10677.599999999999s)]
*  That's going to happen with a human neural interface. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10680.48s)]
*  I think they're gonna create something, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10683.48s)]
*  and they're gonna improve upon it, [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10685.48s)]
*  and it's gonna get better and better, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10687.48s)]
*  and there's gonna be a way of interacting with your mind [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10689.48s)]
*  and the internet and all the people around you. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10691.48s)]
*  I mean, I think that's already happening. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10693.48s)]
*  It kind of is. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10695.48s)]
*  It kind of is, but I think it's going to happen to human beings. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10697.48s)]
*  And it's gonna be one of those things, just like a phone. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10701.48s)]
*  If you imagine when we were kids... [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10704.48s)]
*  Like, I grew up in the 80s, you grew up in the 90s. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10707.56s)]
*  When I was in high school in 1981, [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10709.56s)]
*  I could have never imagined [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10712.56s)]
*  everyone would be carrying a phone. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10714.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10716.56s)]
*  The idea that you could get a hold of someone [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10718.56s)]
*  who's just out. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10720.56s)]
*  You had to talk to people. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10722.56s)]
*  You had to wait. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10724.56s)]
*  You had to go to Gary's house. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10726.56s)]
*  You had to wait for the call. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10728.56s)]
*  You had to listen to your answering machine. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10730.56s)]
*  Yeah, was Monica with Debbie? [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10732.56s)]
*  Where are those guys going? [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10734.56s)]
*  I was in a TV show, Rabbit Hole, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10736.64s)]
*  of the actual human experience of being a human [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10738.64s)]
*  and all that entails. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10740.64s)]
*  Of dating or working or just functioning. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10742.64s)]
*  You had to have patience. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10748.64s)]
*  You had a different level of... [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10751.64s)]
*  Nothing was at a click of a button. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10753.64s)]
*  You had to go get it. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10755.64s)]
*  It's a different world. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10757.64s)]
*  But is it better? That's the question. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10759.64s)]
*  Isn't it better to have all the answers at your fingertips? [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10761.64s)]
*  It's just different. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10763.64s)]
*  My real concern is that [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10765.72s)]
*  we might be the last of the Mohicans. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10767.72s)]
*  Like, 100%. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10769.72s)]
*  I think we're the last of the real human beings. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10771.72s)]
*  I think we're destined to be cyborgs. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10775.72s)]
*  I hope not. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10777.72s)]
*  And I don't think it's that far off. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10779.72s)]
*  I think we're going to be lured into it [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10781.72s)]
*  with the idea that it's going to fix diseases and ailments. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10783.72s)]
*  We're already cyborgs. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10786.72s)]
*  Our consciousness has been altered. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10788.72s)]
*  Our mental functioning is... [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10790.72s)]
*  We're already on machine time. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10794.8s)]
*  I just... [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10796.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10798.8s)]
*  I don't know either. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10800.8s)]
*  I don't know either. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10802.8s)]
*  But I think it's just the beginning. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10804.8s)]
*  It's the tip of the iceberg. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10806.8s)]
*  All that stuff that you just cited, [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10808.8s)]
*  like people being addicted to Snapchat and stuff. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10810.8s)]
*  That's all real. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10812.8s)]
*  That's a thing. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10814.8s)]
*  You're connected to that device. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10816.8s)]
*  You keep it charged. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10818.8s)]
*  You keep getting new ones. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10820.8s)]
*  We reconnect with our own humanity. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10822.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10825.88s)]
*  Be with your family. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10827.88s)]
*  You know what I feel like about that? [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10829.88s)]
*  I feel like it's like holding hands at the side of the ocean [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10831.88s)]
*  while the asteroid comes to hit. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10833.88s)]
*  I don't think it's going to do a goddamn thing. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10835.88s)]
*  All those grounding, survival craft. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10837.88s)]
*  God damn it. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10839.88s)]
*  That we're going to a beautiful place. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10841.88s)]
*  No. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10843.88s)]
*  I think we're going to... [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10845.88s)]
*  I'll be staring into Nick's eyes if that's the case. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10847.88s)]
*  You will. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10849.88s)]
*  I feel like we're all going to go into a world of accelerated evolution. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10851.96s)]
*  That's what I think we're going into a world of. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10855.96s)]
*  And I think we're going into a world of technologically accelerated evolution. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10857.96s)]
*  What does Elon say about this stuff? [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10861.96s)]
*  I'm sure you've asked him this. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10863.96s)]
*  He's this neural link that they're developing. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10865.96s)]
*  One of the quotes he said, [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10867.96s)]
*  you'll be able to talk without words. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10869.96s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10871.96s)]
*  They're first going to do it with people that are paralyzed [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10873.96s)]
*  and people who don't have access to their limbs [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10876.96s)]
*  or access to the function of their limbs. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10880.039999999999s)]
*  They're going to be able to reignite these. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10882.039999999999s)]
*  The idea is to have it function almost like a central nervous system. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10884.039999999999s)]
*  It's like recharge these areas that were damaged [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10888.039999999999s)]
*  and spinal injuries and stuff like that. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10892.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know how the fuck they think they're going to do that. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10894.039999999999s)]
*  Do you have an understanding of how they think that [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10896.039999999999s)]
*  neural link would work with disabled people? [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10900.039999999999s)]
*  Because that was one of the possibilities that they said. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10902.039999999999s)]
*  They're not the only company that can do that. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10906.039999999999s)]
*  They can do that right now. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10909.12s)]
*  How many companies are doing that? [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10911.12s)]
*  I wouldn't call them companies. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10913.12s)]
*  Government, agencies or whatever. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10915.12s)]
*  There's at least two or three different versions of it I've seen. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10918.12s)]
*  I don't know how well they've done it with one person [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10921.12s)]
*  who's absolutely paraplegic, [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10924.12s)]
*  got fucked up in a war or something like that. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10926.12s)]
*  They've got them to sort of walking with help. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10929.12s)]
*  I would imagine if you get paralyzed, [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10932.12s)]
*  it takes probably just a long time to develop your ability [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10935.12s)]
*  to walk again after that. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10938.2s)]
*  Even if they can fix the connections to your legs, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10939.2s)]
*  they haven't been firing. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10942.2s)]
*  But if they can actually do that and get someone to walk again at all, [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10944.2s)]
*  that's insane. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10948.2s)]
*  I'm down for that. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10950.2s)]
*  I think that's the way they're going to lure you in though. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10952.2s)]
*  I really do. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10955.2s)]
*  But I do remember something about neural link doing [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10956.2s)]
*  or having that hopeful potential some day [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10959.2s)]
*  to help people with injuries. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10962.2s)]
*  But I think that what they're describing [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10964.2s)]
*  is that the brain implant restored this man's motion [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10967.28s)]
*  and sense of touch. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10970.28s)]
*  There it is. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10971.28s)]
*  Columbus, Ohio. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10972.28s)]
*  Holla Columbus. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10973.28s)]
*  OH. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10974.28s)]
*  A small computer chip in his brain. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10975.28s)]
*  They used it to improve the range of motion in his arms [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10978.28s)]
*  and to artificially recreate a sense of touch. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10981.28s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10984.28s)]
*  I believe he's connected to a giant computer too. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10985.28s)]
*  It's not just a wireless connection at this point. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10988.28s)]
*  So it's a chip that's in his brain [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10991.28s)]
*  and then the chip is connected to a cable. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10994.28s)]
*  Matrix? [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10996.36s)]
*  Let me see if I can find it. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=10997.36s)]
*  So that's one of the things that they think [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11003.36s)]
*  that these neural implants may be able to do [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11006.36s)]
*  is to improve people with injuries. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11010.36s)]
*  So ultimately, if that's the case, [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11012.36s)]
*  that obviously will be very good for people with injuries. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11014.36s)]
*  The real question is, [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11017.36s)]
*  if people start using any kind of a neural implant [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11018.36s)]
*  and interface it with technology [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11023.36s)]
*  that allows you to access information, [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11024.44s)]
*  has a greater bandwidth for thinking, [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11026.44s)]
*  who knows what kind of programs will be on it [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11028.44s)]
*  that you can run [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11031.44s)]
*  that can give you logical answers to dilemmas. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11032.44s)]
*  Who knows what the fuck this is going to be like? [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11035.44s)]
*  The thing is, everything swings so wildly [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11037.44s)]
*  in this polarized way. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11041.44s)]
*  It'd be so awesome if we could just stick with that [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11043.44s)]
*  and still be people that talk to each other. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11045.44s)]
*  I just don't know if that's an option. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11048.44s)]
*  I have a feeling that's not going to be an option. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11050.44s)]
*  I have a feeling that once people adopt that technology, [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11053.52s)]
*  whatever comes with it, comes with it. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11056.52s)]
*  And we're going to be on a fucking roller coaster [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11058.52s)]
*  ride off the side of a cliff. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11060.52s)]
*  I think we're going to be cyborgs [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11062.52s)]
*  and it's going to happen really quick. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11064.52s)]
*  Even on the website for this Neuralife thing, [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11066.52s)]
*  it says players can immerse themselves in video games. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11068.52s)]
*  I assume this is like applications [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11072.52s)]
*  for what this can already do. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11074.52s)]
*  Whether or not they're doing it. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11076.52s)]
*  Which one is this? [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11078.52s)]
*  This is that Neuralife one I just showed you. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11079.52s)]
*  They're not talking about an implant, are they? [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11081.6s)]
*  They are? [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11084.6s)]
*  On this video it shows the implant in the back of his head. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11085.6s)]
*  So using that implant? [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11087.6s)]
*  I think it has to do with that sleeve he has on his arm too. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11089.6s)]
*  Okay, so go back to that other page [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11092.6s)]
*  so we can read the description [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11093.6s)]
*  of what it's supposed to be doing. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11094.6s)]
*  I don't know if it had that full explanation on it. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11096.6s)]
*  Well, it had whatever that explanation was under it. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11098.6s)]
*  Where's Neuralife? [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11100.6s)]
*  Okay, wearable sleeves showcases our unique background [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11102.6s)]
*  in developing life enhancing products. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11105.6s)]
*  For the first time ever, this technology allows us [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11107.6s)]
*  to measure the nerves and muscles of the forearm [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11109.68s)]
*  with high resolution and in real time. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11112.68s)]
*  The result is targeted simulation interventions [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11114.68s)]
*  that recreate... [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11118.68s)]
*  Stimulation. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11119.68s)]
*  Oh, excuse me. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11120.68s)]
*  Stimulation interventions that recreate complex, [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11121.68s)]
*  dexterous hand movements. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11125.68s)]
*  What? [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11129.68s)]
*  That's incredible. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11130.68s)]
*  So as you move your hands, it will show an actual hand [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11132.68s)]
*  because you're moving the muscles [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11136.68s)]
*  that are specific to moving parts of your hand? [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11138.76s)]
*  Is that like a phantom limb thing, but just... [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11142.76s)]
*  So what is that, recreating his movement of his hand? [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11145.76s)]
*  Is this a person that has a paralyzed hand? [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11150.76s)]
*  Is that what that's supposed to be? [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11152.76s)]
*  I believe so, yeah. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11153.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11154.76s)]
*  Right when he was getting... [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11155.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11156.76s)]
*  See, that's amazing. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11157.76s)]
*  That's amazing. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11158.76s)]
*  Right there, I believe that. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11159.76s)]
*  You can see something in his skull. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11161.76s)]
*  Oh, wow, he's got a chip in his skull. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11162.76s)]
*  Yo. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11164.76s)]
*  And this actually does look like it is wireless. [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11165.76s)]
*  It's not disconnected. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11167.84s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11170.84s)]
*  You're going to get a chip. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11171.84s)]
*  No, no, I'm not. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11172.84s)]
*  We're all getting chips. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11173.84s)]
*  No, I'm not getting one. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11174.84s)]
*  We're all getting chips. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11175.84s)]
*  It's going to be amazing. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11176.84s)]
*  We're going to see through walls. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11177.84s)]
*  You stop that. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11178.84s)]
*  Read each other's minds. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11179.84s)]
*  Ooh, can I fly? [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11180.84s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11181.84s)]
*  Probably just like go on another planet in your brain. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11182.84s)]
*  I think that's probably what happens to life. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11184.84s)]
*  I think what we're doing right now is we're like making a cocoon. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11187.84s)]
*  And then out of that cocoon, a butterfly is going to come out of it. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11191.84s)]
*  And that butterfly is going to be a new kind of life. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11194.84s)]
*  Will it be a robot? [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11196.92s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11199.92s)]
*  What do you want to be? [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11204.92s)]
*  Look, I love all the imperfect parts about being people. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11205.92s)]
*  It's not like what you want to be when you grow up. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11207.92s)]
*  What do you want to be? [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11209.92s)]
*  What do you want to be when you scientifically evolve? [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11210.92s)]
*  Oh, God. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11214.92s)]
*  I don't. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11216.92s)]
*  If I am, I am. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11218.92s)]
*  I'm not thinking about it like that. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11219.92s)]
*  I want to be an eagle. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11221.92s)]
*  Ooh, that's what you like? [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11222.92s)]
*  If they could tell you, you could be whatever animal you want. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11225.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11228.0s)]
*  Imagine if animals had people brains. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11229.0s)]
*  Again, Greek mythology, all the gods would be animals. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11231.0s)]
*  Like Zeus would be a bull. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11234.0s)]
*  Do you know how fucked we would be if animals were as smart as us? [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11235.0s)]
*  They're pretty fucking smart. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11238.0s)]
*  Are they though? [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11239.0s)]
*  Intuitively and emotionally. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11241.0s)]
*  No, they have amazing senses. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11243.0s)]
*  They've got an edge. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11245.0s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11246.0s)]
*  But as far as smart, no, we can plan shit. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11247.0s)]
*  They can't plan shit. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11251.0s)]
*  They just go on instinct for the most part. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11253.08s)]
*  But if like deer could plan shit. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11255.08s)]
*  Wait, I've heard that. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11259.08s)]
*  If there was like suicidal deer. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11261.08s)]
*  Wasn't there like a real thing about raccoons taking over the world or spiders or something? [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11263.08s)]
*  Oh, spiders. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11268.08s)]
*  Like if they integrated their instincts intellectually, like they'd be like taken over in like a week and a half or something. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11269.08s)]
*  You know what would accelerate people's acceptance of climate change? [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11278.08s)]
*  Oh, God. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11282.16s)]
*  If global warming was making spiders bigger. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11283.16s)]
*  Spiders just started getting real. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11286.16s)]
*  It turns out there's a switch. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11289.16s)]
*  Whatever the number is. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11290.16s)]
*  They're already pretty fucking big. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11291.16s)]
*  If the world gets like above one degree temperature, spiders grow by 400%. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11292.16s)]
*  Really? [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11296.16s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11297.16s)]
*  No, I'm just making it up right now. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11298.16s)]
*  But imagine if this is happening every degree. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11300.16s)]
*  So, but accelerate. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11302.16s)]
*  So 400% of 400%. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11303.16s)]
*  I want out. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11305.16s)]
*  You get all sudden you got a fucking Labrador sized spider fucking up your grandmother. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11306.16s)]
*  You come home, your grandma's wrapped in a cocoon in the middle of the living room. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11310.24s)]
*  Have you seen the mist? [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11314.24s)]
*  I did see the mist. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11315.24s)]
*  Oh, God. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11316.24s)]
*  It was good. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11317.24s)]
*  It was so dark at the end. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11318.24s)]
*  Very dark. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11319.24s)]
*  The end is hard. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11320.24s)]
*  It's hard. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11321.24s)]
*  It's very, very difficult. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11322.24s)]
*  But they were faithful to the book, I think. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11323.24s)]
*  I think that's why it was so hard. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11325.24s)]
*  Well, that's what they had. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11326.24s)]
*  They had these like life size, life size, but you know. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11327.24s)]
*  Stephen King. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11330.24s)]
*  In sex. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11331.24s)]
*  When he was fucked up on the hooch and doing blow, he made some of the greatest fucking books of all time. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11332.24s)]
*  Anybody you can't tell me any different. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11337.32s)]
*  I guarantee you the hooch. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11340.32s)]
*  You like scary stuff? [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11341.32s)]
*  And the blow. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11342.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11343.32s)]
*  Really? [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11344.32s)]
*  You like horror films and stuff? [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11345.32s)]
*  I do not. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11346.32s)]
*  No? [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11347.32s)]
*  No. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11348.32s)]
*  Why not? [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11349.32s)]
*  Well, I scare easily. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11350.32s)]
*  I get startled very easily. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11353.32s)]
*  Like if like some I didn't hear somebody come into the room kind of thing. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11355.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11358.32s)]
*  Also, life is scary enough. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11359.32s)]
*  It is. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11362.32s)]
*  And like to, you know what I really like I really have an aversion to is like the religious [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11363.4s)]
*  scary stuff like the satanic deep evil. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11368.64s)]
*  Like when I was a kid. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11372.52s)]
*  That's growing up Catholic. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11373.52s)]
*  When I saw the omen as a child, I pulled my twin mattress into my parents' room and I [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11374.52s)]
*  slept there until they finally kicked me out. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11380.6s)]
*  But I mean, I was almost irrevocably altered at the thought of being taken over and possessed [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11383.199999999999s)]
*  against my will. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11392.64s)]
*  Like I didn't invite this in. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11394.199999999999s)]
*  But it's like like a fungus. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11395.72s)]
*  And it was a possibility. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11397.68s)]
*  Just the thought of it is fucking terrifying. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11399.88s)]
*  Well people talked about it like it was a real thing. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11401.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11403.6s)]
*  I was watching a YouTube video once of a guy who's performed exorcists was a priest who [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11404.6s)]
*  was talking about different exorcists that he performed. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11409.88s)]
*  There's really interesting. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11413.08s)]
*  I mean you want to get weird. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11414.68s)]
*  You want to get psychedelic. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11415.68s)]
*  This stuff is like I think there is a personally there are some doors not to be knocked on [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11416.880000000001s)]
*  or opened and spiritually or energetically. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11424.720000000001s)]
*  Energy is powerful. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11431.4s)]
*  I think human beings are powerful. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11432.4s)]
*  Our consciousness, whatever is beyond that. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11434.92s)]
*  And you just don't know. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11438.220000000001s)]
*  And I have just a real inherent instinct and aversion to the other in that way. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11440.64s)]
*  It scares me. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11450.68s)]
*  And you know I've done enough psychedelics to have some things that I was learning about [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11451.68s)]
*  within myself and externally. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11459.76s)]
*  And you know that could sound crazy or like hooey. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11461.56s)]
*  But I don't know. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11465.28s)]
*  I don't like to mess with that stuff. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11467.56s)]
*  It scares me. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11469.04s)]
*  Well if it's real, one of the best ways if you were the devil, you would make it preposterous [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11470.6s)]
*  that you would be real while at the same time people worship God. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11480.0s)]
*  Because if you believe in God you have to believe in the devil. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11484.12s)]
*  It's part of a package deal. [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11488.28s)]
*  But listen so if the president is on television and says God bless our troops, everybody's [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11489.84s)]
*  like all right. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11495.0s)]
*  But if the president gets on TV and says we've located the devil, he's in Sudan, we're sending [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11496.4s)]
*  troops there immediately. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11500.2s)]
*  Like what? [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11501.36s)]
*  The fucking actual devil? [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11503.36s)]
*  No bitch. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11504.8s)]
*  This guy's out of his fucking mind. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11505.88s)]
*  You can say God bless us all. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11507.28s)]
*  May God be with you. [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11510.12s)]
*  You can say I am a God-fearing man and I believe in God. [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11511.64s)]
*  I think God has a message for us all. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11514.56s)]
*  You can say all those things. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11516.44s)]
*  Sure. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11517.44s)]
*  But if you say I know where the devil is and we're going to go kill him. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11518.44s)]
*  That's it? [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11521.88s)]
*  You believe in the devil? [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11524.08s)]
*  You fucking idiot. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11525.2s)]
*  You believe in the actual devil. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11526.2s)]
*  But wouldn't that be the best way for the devil to hide? [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11529.119999999999s)]
*  If the devil's real, if Satan is real and if there really are demons, wouldn't the best [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11533.44s)]
*  way to just hide in plain sight and ridicule? [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11537.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11540.92s)]
*  Imagine if all of the evil of the world. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11541.92s)]
*  I don't think we need to imagine it. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11544.52s)]
*  All the creepy shit that's infecting Putin's brain right now and all these dictators and [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11546.32s)]
*  all the people that are having people murdered and assassinated, attacking and imagine if [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11551.08s)]
*  that's all just demons. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11555.84s)]
*  Yeah, it takes a specific kind of being slash vessel. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11556.84s)]
*  You kind of, I don't know. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11560.28s)]
*  Maybe demons are just thoughts. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11562.92s)]
*  But also sociopaths. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11564.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's that too. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11565.6s)]
*  Scientifically, there's a real mental deficiency of, I mean, there's no empathy. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11567.32s)]
*  There's no. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11573.8s)]
*  That's real. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11574.8s)]
*  There's real ones. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11575.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11576.8s)]
*  Which is very frightening. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11577.8s)]
*  But let's stay in the light. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11579.519999999999s)]
*  That is frightening. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11582.519999999999s)]
*  And that's a function of what? [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11583.519999999999s)]
*  Is it a function of genetics? [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11585.519999999999s)]
*  Is it a function of raising a child? [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11587.039999999999s)]
*  Is it a combination of all those things? [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11588.88s)]
*  Nature, nurture and other things. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11590.759999999998s)]
*  And other things. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11593.24s)]
*  And just like, is it just a function sometimes of you just didn't get wired correctly? [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11594.24s)]
*  Like how many people do you know that it is not wired right? [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11599.88s)]
*  A deal. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11602.48s)]
*  A good deal. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11603.48s)]
*  A bunch. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11604.48s)]
*  A good deal. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11605.48s)]
*  A bunch. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11606.48s)]
*  Like some artists are just not wired right? [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11608.16s)]
*  So Nick is a big comic book. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11610.6s)]
*  Like Maven knows probably every major Marvel, you name it. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11613.24s)]
*  And he introduced me to this comic called Prometheus by Alan Moore. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11619.039999999999s)]
*  And basically it goes, it's almost like an entire dissertation on magic. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11624.8s)]
*  And like Aleister Crowley and the cabal. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11629.72s)]
*  And one, I've really enjoyed it. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11633.0s)]
*  There's a lot of relevance to its, I mean, like going, basically the cabal is like the [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11636.76s)]
*  tree of life. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11647.08s)]
*  And from the lower sphere, which is like us, and then moving up through this thing to the [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11648.92s)]
*  godhead, which is like the pinprick of our existence and soul if you want to look at [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11654.52s)]
*  it like that. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11659.76s)]
*  And I've just been one enamored and fascinated by it, by this just literature and literal [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11660.84s)]
*  ancient text. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11667.12s)]
*  Like the cabal and solomonic magic has been around for a long time. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11668.960000000001s)]
*  And there's something that gets the hair on the back of my neck just standing up with [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11676.36s)]
*  like holy shit, what am I reading right now? [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11682.32s)]
*  And you know, I don't know. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11686.48s)]
*  I like to lead by my instinct and my own understanding of the world. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11689.56s)]
*  And so this stuff is, it kind of speaks to that in a way that I can't like in detail [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11694.16s)]
*  get into it. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11701.24s)]
*  But it's, you know, like we're talking about science, we're talking about cyborgs, we're [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11702.24s)]
*  talking about other dimensional aspects to our existence. [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11707.56s)]
*  And that's like magic to me. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11712.359999999999s)]
*  There might be something to it. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11716.32s)]
*  There might be something to just getting people to believe it. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11718.28s)]
*  Maybe that's almost enough. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11722.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm really interested in ancient text and just the like recycling and recirculation [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11723.320000000002s)]
*  of that stuff of like, well, why does that keep coming up? [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11731.460000000001s)]
*  And I can understand how this feels like that. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11734.400000000001s)]
*  And this feels like that. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11736.12s)]
*  And in our present day experience, you know, I don't know. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11737.12s)]
*  I'm just I'm just, you know, talking about what I've read and what I've experienced. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11743.4s)]
*  And it is creepy when you think about old stuff and the devil. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11748.36s)]
*  That's the creepiest. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11751.8s)]
*  That's why the exorcists are so creepy. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11752.8s)]
*  Right. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11754.279999999999s)]
*  They found that old talisman. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11755.279999999999s)]
*  Can't do it. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11756.279999999999s)]
*  I stay away from it. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11757.279999999999s)]
*  It's I have an aversion to it. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11758.279999999999s)]
*  I don't I don't want it. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11759.279999999999s)]
*  It's something about like ancient stuff and the devil. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11760.279999999999s)]
*  That's the scariest stuff. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11763.32s)]
*  Like they found an old scroll. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11764.32s)]
*  And if you read it out loud. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11766.119999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, like, I mean, even the Bible. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11767.8s)]
*  Has so many other versions of itself, you know, like you have the King James version [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11772.88s)]
*  and then you have all these other things. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11778.48s)]
*  And like I'm I don't want to read revelations. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11780.039999999999s)]
*  I'm too scared. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11783.08s)]
*  The Old Testament is the most fascinating. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11784.08s)]
*  Have you read it? [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11787.64s)]
*  The problem with the New Testament is from what I understand, it was created and curated [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11788.64s)]
*  by Constantine and a bunch of bishops. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11792.88s)]
*  They you know, they they literally decided what to put in the New Testament and what [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11795.88s)]
*  to not put in. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11799.48s)]
*  When you get to the Old Testament, the Old Testament is the wildest shit because it seems [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11801.199999999999s)]
*  it shows how petty people were over things like one of them. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11805.68s)]
*  There's a story about how a guy who's no tolerance is a guy who's bald and some kids [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11809.84s)]
*  called him a bald head. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11815.16s)]
*  And so a bear comes out of the woods and kills all the kids. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11817.359999999999s)]
*  Because the guy was bald. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11823.119999999999s)]
*  What's the lesson? [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11824.359999999999s)]
*  This fucking the lesson is don't be mean to bald guys. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11825.439999999999s)]
*  It's the dumbest lesson ever. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11828.96s)]
*  It's like this fucking guy, these kids murdered. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11831.119999999999s)]
*  He had them murdered because they called him a bald head. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11834.759999999998s)]
*  And like this was like God's version of like righteousness. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11838.72s)]
*  Like there's some wild shit in the Old Testament. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11841.759999999998s)]
*  What is that story? [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11845.359999999999s)]
*  What is that exact story about the dude? [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11846.56s)]
*  I was just looking at this. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11848.199999999999s)]
*  This article here says it's a misunderstood tale and it's actually about war. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11849.8s)]
*  I was trying to get into this, but you asked too quick if I could find out. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11853.96s)]
*  Well, it's about a fucking bear eating kids though. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11857.72s)]
*  Whatever his interpretation of what the ultimate meaning was supposed to be as [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11862.4s)]
*  thought down over thousands of years of text and an oral tradition that spans a [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11867.84s)]
*  thousand years after that or before that. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11872.039999999999s)]
*  What is the actual verse? [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11875.6s)]
*  What is it about? [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11878.16s)]
*  So it's some boys are they tease him. [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11881.199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11885.199999999999s)]
*  Some boys tease him. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11886.039999999999s)]
*  So it says he went up from Bethel and while he was going up on the way, some [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11889.519999999999s)]
*  small boys came out of the city and jeered at him saying, go up, you bald head. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11894.24s)]
*  Go up, you bald head. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11899.519999999999s)]
*  So that was enough. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11902.199999999999s)]
*  And God was like, I've heard enough. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11904.039999999999s)]
*  I will now send in bears. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11906.08s)]
*  So then God sent in a fucking she bear. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11908.519999999999s)]
*  I think he said he called it a she bear. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11912.08s)]
*  So what does it say? [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11914.8s)]
*  What, what happens where the bear comes in? [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11915.64s)]
*  Well, this is all talking about how it's wrong. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11918.439999999999s)]
*  So, okay. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11919.8s)]
*  Let's, let's find what the translation is first and then we'll go and refute it. [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11921.0s)]
*  I just want to see what the, the actual translation was. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11927.4s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11933.279999999999s)]
*  Came out and tell him, cheered him. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11936.48s)]
*  Go up, you bald head. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11937.56s)]
*  They said, go, uh, go on up, you bald head. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11938.599999999999s)]
*  He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11942.2s)]
*  Lord is in all caps. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11948.880000000001s)]
*  Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of the youth. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11950.28s)]
*  It seems unbelievable that God would cause two bears to maul a group of children for [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11956.2s)]
*  making fun of a man for being bald. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11960.960000000001s)]
*  Who wrote this? [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11963.92s)]
*  This one also refutes it too. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11964.560000000001s)]
*  But if that is that the translation? [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11966.36s)]
*  That's where I was going to, I wasn't even going to say the bald head [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11968.720000000001s)]
*  translation right away goes, well, what word did they use back then? [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11971.48s)]
*  And how did it get translated to English as the same bald head? [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11975.84s)]
*  Cause [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11978.32s)]
*  but even if he said fuckhead, we've been called them a fuckhead. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11978.64s)]
*  They had kids killed by bears. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11981.199999999999s)]
*  Fuck back then. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11983.199999999999s)]
*  Was that a word? [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11983.88s)]
*  Maybe it's bald. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11984.8s)]
*  Maybe the ball was fun. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11985.6s)]
*  They even called them cunt head. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11988.039999999999s)]
*  That's literally God's reaction is to have a bear kill 42 kids. [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11989.8s)]
*  I don't know how you could spin that. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11994.72s)]
*  This sounds like they're trying to spin it. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11996.199999999999s)]
*  That's where I was going to go. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11997.72s)]
*  The word for bald might not have been the thing that they use. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=11998.359999999999s)]
*  And then someone got stuck on bald, you know, because they wanted to have a story. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12000.72s)]
*  Yeah, perhaps. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12005.119999999999s)]
*  But I mean, no matter what the name would be that he would call them cunt head, [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12006.599999999999s)]
*  there's not a chance in hell that a righteous God would send a bear to kill those kids. [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12010.56s)]
*  That's but well, so that's if that's the actual translation that a bear came and [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12015.519999999999s)]
*  killed the children, which I've always understood it to be. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12019.519999999999s)]
*  Kurt Metzger explained to me what that's saying. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12023.76s)]
*  Go on up, you bald head that it's like it's more harsh. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12026.4s)]
*  It's like we think of it as like, I mean, it's like going up your asshole or something like that. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12031.279999999999s)]
*  It's like it's mean. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12036.0s)]
*  OK, it's not as seems like get out of here. [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12037.359999999999s)]
*  Bald head. Yeah, that sounds like so pedestrian scallywag. [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12038.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, probably is a harsher connotation to it. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12042.48s)]
*  OK, but either way, God decides to have a bear come and kill the kids. [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12044.76s)]
*  What the fuck? So those stories are the most fascinating to me because like how petty [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12050.679999999998s)]
*  people were, how light and it was obvious like there was like human [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12055.24s)]
*  like feelings of the world divorced from God's. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12060.2s)]
*  If if there is a pure loving God and that God gave us a message like the people [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12063.96s)]
*  fucked that message up. By the time they translated it down. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12068.32s)]
*  There's a lot of human jizz all over it. [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12071.28s)]
*  That's what this whole like Promethea thing explains in a really beautiful way. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12073.8s)]
*  Have you ever read the Apocrypha? [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12079.44s)]
*  No. Those are the. [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12081.92s)]
*  The books that were taken out of the Bible. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12083.76s)]
*  I haven't read them either, but I know a little bit about them. [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12086.4s)]
*  And, you know, it's kind of like I kind of look at some of that as political [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12088.72s)]
*  and a sign of the times, you know, you were sort of trying to steer people [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12093.88s)]
*  a certain way. I don't know. But. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12096.84s)]
*  To me, the most interesting version is the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12100.0s)]
*  Sure. Did you ever read any of that stuff like the John Marco Allegro stuff? [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12103.039999999999s)]
*  John Marco Allegro was a scholar who was also [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12107.88s)]
*  he was an agnostic. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12111.04s)]
*  He was agnostic, but he was an ordained minister. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12112.56s)]
*  So he became an ordained minister and they started studying theology [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12114.36s)]
*  and eventually became agnostic. But he was a language expert. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12117.04s)]
*  And so he was hired to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12120.48s)]
*  So they did it for 14 years. He deciphered these things. [[03:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12122.88s)]
*  They're putting together these. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12125.24s)]
*  They had to use DNA because they had to make sure that the the cow, [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12126.44s)]
*  the fragments were from the same cow, which would indicate that it was [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12129.84s)]
*  the same piece of skin. OK, because it's literally on animal skins. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12132.8s)]
*  That they found in these these ceramic vessels in cumulus. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12135.96s)]
*  Ceramic vessels in cumron hidden in the fucking the side of a mountain. [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12139.6s)]
*  Wild shit. So they take these down. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12144.279999999999s)]
*  They they realize is the oldest version of the Bible by far. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12146.92s)]
*  And it's the I think it's an Aramaic. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12150.199999999999s)]
*  It's one of the only ones in Aramaic. [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12152.279999999999s)]
*  And at the end of this translation, over 14 years, [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12153.92s)]
*  John Marco Allegro writes a book called The Sacred Mushroom in the Cross. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12157.32s)]
*  And he says the entire religion was a misunderstanding. [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12161.4s)]
*  And what it was originally about was psychedelic mushrooms [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12164.119999999999s)]
*  and fertility rituals, and that that's what created this religion. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12167.039999999999s)]
*  These people were taking mushrooms and they were experiencing God [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12171.84s)]
*  and they were having fertility rituals because they were trying to be as bountiful [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12175.96s)]
*  and have as many babies as possible. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12179.359999999999s)]
*  And that's what the Bible was originally all about. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12181.16s)]
*  Now, by the way, it's heavily disputed. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12183.56s)]
*  A lot of people don't agree with them. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12185.32s)]
*  A lot of people think it's blasphemy and it's this and it's that. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12186.519999999999s)]
*  But the fact remains that this guy was a legit scholar, rock solid credentials, [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12189.279999999999s)]
*  not a drug addict, not a not a not a guy who even did psychedelics. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12193.68s)]
*  But it was his interpretation after all this time that these [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12197.36s)]
*  a lot of the things in the story had meanings [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12201.08s)]
*  that would go back to psychedelic mushrooms. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12204.2s)]
*  And one of them was the word Christ. [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12206.64s)]
*  He said you could trace the word Christ back to an ancient Sumerian word [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12208.52s)]
*  that meant a mushroom covered in God's semen. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12213.16s)]
*  They thought that when it when it rained, [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12217.36s)]
*  it was the Lord putting semen on the earth. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12219.960000000001s)]
*  And that's why things would grow from the rain. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12223.04s)]
*  And one of the things that would grow is these mushrooms, like overnight. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12225.28s)]
*  So overnight, they'd find these psilocybin [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12228.28s)]
*  mushrooms and these aminida muscaria mushrooms like on cow shit. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12229.92s)]
*  And they'd pick them up and they'd eat them and they'd trip balls. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12233.44s)]
*  And so they wanted to protect that and hide that from intruders. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12236.2s)]
*  And they hid it in stories and allegories. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12240.84s)]
*  And this was his assertion. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12243.4s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, too. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12245.44s)]
*  Like, first of all, that's amazing. Wild, wild. Yeah. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12246.72s)]
*  But like this, like [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12250.16s)]
*  when do we have the opportunity to record something like this is all hand made? [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12252.8s)]
*  These are stories. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12257.439999999999s)]
*  These are stories for story and allegory. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12258.4s)]
*  And like it's really. [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12261.0s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing how we can marry ourselves to these ideas and concepts. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12265.279999999999s)]
*  And and like, and I and I have mine, I really do [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12271.32s)]
*  that are real for me in in thought and spirit and intention. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12274.84s)]
*  And but like, I mean. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12278.8s)]
*  We people have decimated other countries over this, these allegories and these stories. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12282.92s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, they've crushed nations, killed innocents. [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12288.359999999999s)]
*  And we're probably doing it right now. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12291.92s)]
*  It's a it's a real. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12294.32s)]
*  It's a it's amazing how it the scales have tipped between like. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12296.84s)]
*  You know, your ideologies that become religions [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12303.92s)]
*  and the way that we attack and defend. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12307.16s)]
*  And like, I don't know. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12311.2s)]
*  I don't know what to do out there. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12314.64s)]
*  You know, but this stuff we're talking about and even in just like as an idea [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12316.36s)]
*  is fascinating and I loved I love to explore it. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12320.44s)]
*  Like, why not explore the idea of Christ being a mushroom? [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12322.68s)]
*  It might really be. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12326.56s)]
*  It might really be. [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12328.08s)]
*  Because if you think about like some of the teachings of Christ, [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12328.92s)]
*  they they really like aligned with like psychedelic mindset, [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12332.279999999999s)]
*  that treating each other like we're all the same. [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12336.92s)]
*  Yeah, that we're all one. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12339.0s)]
*  I felt that oneness before that that feeling that that thing that that God plays [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12340.32s)]
*  like 100 percent and percent and I have my interpretation of it. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12345.199999999999s)]
*  And so does so many people. Yeah. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12348.8s)]
*  So many people do. [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12352.759999999998s)]
*  It's kind of like, do you want to write a book about it called The Secret? [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12353.679999999998s)]
*  Or do you want to just live your life, live your life the right way? [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12356.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And try to try to be cool, man. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12360.32s)]
*  Jesus, just be cool. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12363.08s)]
*  Yeah. But it's like that's what we're all doing, right? [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12367.68s)]
*  We're all just trying to figure out how to live life better. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12371.119999999999s)]
*  And when something comes along, that seems to be like a method [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12373.24s)]
*  that other people are using, whether it's a religion or whether it's being a Democrat, [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12375.64s)]
*  whatever it is that like gets you thinking that you're on the right side of things [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12380.119999999999s)]
*  and you're with a good community and you support, you know, you get into it. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12384.199999999999s)]
*  We have problems in adopting patterns of thinking and behavior and being tribal [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12387.76s)]
*  and fucking being against other people that we determine to be of a differing ideology. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12394.52s)]
*  And we would justify like horrible behavior in the name of doing that. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12401.4s)]
*  I don't know if that's our fault necessarily. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12406.48s)]
*  Like, I think the influence of of technology or other machines [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12408.56s)]
*  that we don't really know about yet, like that pit us against each other. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12411.96s)]
*  We used to be able to coexist with different ideas and religions and opinions. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12415.84s)]
*  But now it's like it is it is so polarized and it's like life or death. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12420.4s)]
*  There is a lot of polarization. [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12426.52s)]
*  And you're right, there are a lot of foreign factors. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12427.84s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of governments that are dedicated to fucking with people online [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12430.16s)]
*  and getting people to fight with each other. That's real. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12434.64s)]
*  I mean, that is a 100 percent real thing. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12437.68s)]
*  That seems like it shouldn't be real. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12440.32s)]
*  It seems like espionage, cyber espionage, like some kind of crazy [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12441.92s)]
*  like diversion of the attention of people. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12445.839999999998s)]
*  But it's real. They really are doing it. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12448.48s)]
*  And whether it has a one percent effect on people or a 10 percent effect on people, [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12450.48s)]
*  whatever the effect, it has an effect. [[03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12454.8s)]
*  And you got to be aware of it. [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12457.199999999999s)]
*  But I think that's one of those things that we're going to work through. [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12458.08s)]
*  We're going to we're going to be have to be more sophisticated about what we absorb. [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12460.359999999999s)]
*  And it's going to ultimately it's going to be like a cyber winter. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12464.519999999999s)]
*  We're going to have to go through a cyber winter, develop some thick skin. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12469.0s)]
*  And maybe that's what kids kids are going through. [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12472.44s)]
*  They're going through cyber winter. [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12474.720000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't want them to go through winter. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12475.84s)]
*  I never went through winter. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12477.4s)]
*  My poor children have to shovel snow. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12478.720000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's what they have to do. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12480.720000000001s)]
*  They have to shovel cyber snow. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12482.0s)]
*  All wheel drive. Yeah. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12483.56s)]
*  All drive with your mind. [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12484.880000000001s)]
*  Free yourself from it. [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12486.56s)]
*  And maybe it's our job as people that have lived in both realms. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12488.08s)]
*  You know, you and I both grew up with no Internet. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12492.28s)]

*  And then I saw one in Utah a year ago that was about one eighty. [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12799.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. It was huge. [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12804.0s)]

*  Are you I mean, obviously you hunt with other people. [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12851.84s)]
*  Yeah. Generally, I use at least going with at least one guy. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12855.08s)]
*  Most of the time, it's one guy and me. That's it. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12859.52s)]
*  Yeah. So like you should get more guys. [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12861.720000000001s)]
*  You should be with at least four. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12864.44s)]
*  Nope. You make too much noise. [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12866.880000000001s)]
*  You make too much noise. [[03:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12869.0s)]
*  You can't get too much smell and too much movement and too much noise. [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12870.960000000001s)]
*  You want to do with the minimum amount of people possible. [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12874.32s)]
*  Too much smell. So do you like are you aware of like what you [[03:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12876.4s)]

*  Their sense of smell. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12886.960000000001s)]
*  It's all about finding where the wind is going. [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12888.2s)]
*  So what you do is you carry this little wind checker with you. [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12891.04s)]
*  So it's like a white powder, like talcum powder. [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12894.08s)]
*  And you puff it in the air and it shows you which way the wind is blowing. [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12896.64s)]
*  So if the wind is blowing that way, we're going that way, [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12900.48s)]
*  because that way the wind is in our face and the animals aren't going to get our scent. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12903.76s)]
*  They're going to are their sense going to come towards us, [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12907.76s)]
*  but they're not getting our scent. [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12910.0s)]

*  Right. Hundreds of yards away, hundreds of yards away. [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12914.12s)]
*  They pop up and one of them will bark like, wow. [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12916.68s)]
*  And then they fucking take off. [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12919.439999999999s)]
*  Wow. They make noises, they woof. [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12921.279999999999s)]

*  I haven't had any scary run ins with things other than in Alberta. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12930.16s)]
*  I did see a grizzly bear and that was a very different. [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12934.039999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't a big one either. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12937.48s)]
*  It was like a six foot bear, which is not big for grizzly bears. [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12938.64s)]
*  But it was the way it looked at me was so much different [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12941.679999999998s)]
*  than anything that I've ever seen in the wild. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12945.16s)]
*  It looks at you like this, like black bears. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12947.52s)]
*  I've seen black bears in the wild and they look at you like this. [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12950.92s)]
*  Like, what are you going to meet? [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12953.320000000002s)]

*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [[03:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12958.68s)]
*  They're a little nervous. [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12960.16s)]

*  I feel like you should bring a handgun. [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12972.92s)]
*  Probably a good move when you're bringing shotgun and a handgun. [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12974.24s)]
*  Just because you're my friend and I love you. [[03:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12976.48s)]
*  Armor and shit probably should not be there. [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12977.92s)]
*  This is more me worrying about you. [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12980.359999999999s)]
*  But it's just looking at them eye to eye and thinking [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12982.76s)]
*  this is a thing that's taken out. [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12985.24s)]
*  Yeah. This thing's out, you know, eating moose calves and shit. [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12986.359999999999s)]

*  They eat each other a lot. [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12993.439999999999s)]
*  I like to fall asleep to like planet Earth, like that, if I'm anxious. [[03:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12995.68s)]
*  But I have to avoid the hardcore parts, you know, [[03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=12999.64s)]
*  where basically bears and like tigers, because it just gets it's too intense. [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13003.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm trying to relax. [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13008.12s)]
*  But then my heart rate goes up. [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13009.92s)]
*  But you know, it might be more intense. [[03:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13011.320000000002s)]
*  But we're just not looking at it at scale as praying mantises. [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13013.68s)]
*  They might be the most evil motherfuckers on Earth. [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13017.640000000001s)]
*  I went down a praying mantis rabbit hole this morning. [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13020.12s)]
*  Do you see one? [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13023.12s)]
*  No, I was watching a fucking Instagram reel [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13024.560000000001s)]
*  and it had this praying mantis that was destroying [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13028.720000000001s)]
*  like a caterpillar, just holding it and just eats the whole thing. [[03:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13032.64s)]
*  I mean, it's almost as big as it. [[03:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13036.88s)]
*  Yeah. It consumes the whole thing. [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13038.72s)]
*  Then she kills her lover. [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13040.519999999999s)]
*  Is that what they do? Oh, yeah. [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13042.8s)]
*  Praying mantises. Yeah. Yeah. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13043.96s)]
*  They kill their mate. They mate with them and they eat them. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13045.24s)]
*  That's a black widow thing, too, right? [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13048.359999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I think that's praying mantis thing. [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13050.039999999999s)]
*  I thought the black widow, that was like the whole thing. [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13052.68s)]
*  Jamie, she kills the dad. [[03:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13054.72s)]
*  Like, fuck you, bitch. I raised my own kids. [[03:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13056.599999999999s)]
*  I think they like go off and he's like, here's here's your baby. [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13058.599999999999s)]
*  Bye. Take care of it. [[03:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13061.76s)]
*  Really? I don't know. [[03:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13063.24s)]
*  But no praying mantis. [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13066.28s)]
*  Myth. Myth. [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13068.76s)]
*  When black widow spiders mate, the female always kills and eats the male. [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13069.56s)]
*  Fact. This myth, which is not totally false, [[03:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13073.44s)]
*  but very far from true, is believed even by scientists [[03:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13077.08s)]
*  and can be found in many ecology textbooks. [[03:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13080.64s)]
*  OK, but if it's not totally false, it's like it's like, do you eat your husbands? [[03:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13083.28s)]
*  I don't need all my husbands. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13086.880000000001s)]
*  Sometimes they that's the same with praying mantis. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13089.12s)]
*  They do a good job and they're polite. I let them live. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13091.04s)]
*  But I've seen it. Like, I've seen them. [[03:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13093.400000000001s)]
*  Like, they make they kind of stick together. [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13094.92s)]
*  And then all of a sudden one of their heads is gone. [[03:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13096.320000000002s)]
*  You know what's the most evil? What? [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13098.28s)]
*  Octopuses. What? [[03:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13099.92s)]
*  Because female octopuses are larger than the males [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13101.880000000001s)]
*  and they'll have sex with the males until they decide they don't want to anymore. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13105.12s)]
*  And then they often kill them and eat them. [[03:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13108.560000000001s)]
*  That is unfortunate. [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13110.640000000001s)]
*  So the male might successfully breed with the female like 13 times in a row. [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13111.800000000001s)]
*  And he's going back for lucky 14. [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13116.480000000001s)]
*  Not today, bitch. [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13118.880000000001s)]
*  You worn out, you're welcome. [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13121.560000000001s)]
*  And she kills him and she eats him. [[03:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13122.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But he died doing what he loves. [[03:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13124.04s)]
*  Good point. Solid point. [[03:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13126.640000000001s)]
*  What a ruthless world that is. [[03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13131.2s)]
*  And you want to complain about pronouns? [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13133.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13136.6s)]
*  That's what I'm saying this whole time. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13138.52s)]
*  You're not a plural. [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13140.52s)]
*  That was one of my favorite Dave Chappelle's [[03:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13143.640000000001s)]
*  when he was talking about [[03:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13146.44s)]
*  like they're coming for you. [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13149.36s)]
*  And he's like, well, they they or they like [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13150.44s)]
*  figure out which they were coming for. [[03:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13153.52s)]
*  Did you know the black widow's venom liquefies its victim and it sucks it up? [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13156.32s)]
*  That is terrifying. [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13160.400000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13162.36s)]
*  Because this article says that that's exactly what it does to its male. [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13163.36s)]

*  I'm a big fan of the videos where the birds of prey are struggling with a snake [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13392.84s)]
*  and then they get away and they live because I love birds. [[03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13396.92s)]
*  I think insects are scarier than reptiles and lizards. [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13401.16s)]
*  Insects are like the lowest form of evil. [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13404.88s)]
*  This is like flowers. [[03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13408.039999999999s)]

*  No, that is that is absolutely horrifying. [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13413.800000000001s)]
*  I think it's pure white like the leaves. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13415.84s)]
*  It looks like a cockatoo. [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13417.560000000001s)]
*  And it's just destroying things. [[03:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13418.880000000001s)]
*  And look at that. It looks just like a flower. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13421.32s)]
*  And then you go over and land and it's like, oh, come on over. [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13423.28s)]
*  I'm ready. I'm your friend. [[03:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13425.880000000001s)]

*  If you land, I'm just a flower. [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13435.960000000001s)]
*  I'm definitely not a murderous, predatory, raptor like insect. [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13438.36s)]
*  Bam. Got you, bitch. [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13443.68s)]
*  He tried, didn't get him. [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13446.0s)]
*  That was a mistake. That's a lot of movement. [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13448.28s)]
*  So this thing is like picking up on movement [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13450.36s)]
*  and just trying to find the right time to explode. [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13453.12s)]
*  They're fast, too. Have you ever seen them like move? [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13456.720000000001s)]

*  It keeps trying. They can run. [[03:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13460.44s)]
*  So this is interesting that it's not always successful. [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13462.400000000001s)]

*  Oh, my God. [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13477.0s)]
*  And they're fascinating to see in the wild because you look at them [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13477.960000000001s)]
*  and they really are different than all the other insects [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13481.160000000002s)]
*  because they're a predator of insects. [[03:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13483.52s)]
*  Like the predator of the ones that we're all scared of, like bees. [[03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13485.6s)]
*  Now, like, I'm scared. [[03:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13488.04s)]
*  I'm scared of bees. Are you scared of bees? [[03:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13489.36s)]
*  They'll kill you if not if I bite you at once. [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13491.0s)]
*  Once you remember the killer bees, [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13494.08s)]
*  everybody's worried about Africanized killer bees. [[03:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13495.4s)]
*  I'm worried about them. I think they're OK. [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13497.4s)]
*  I like flowers. [[03:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13499.359999999999s)]
*  Those are gnarly looking things. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13500.92s)]
*  Is that real? Whoa. [[03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13502.64s)]
*  What the fuck? What are those things? [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13503.96s)]
*  I think they have costumes on. It's a different kind of mantis. [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13505.76s)]
*  That's a mantis with a costume. [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13507.279999999999s)]
*  They're cosplaying mantises. [[03:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13509.08s)]
*  Looks like it, but it totally does. [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13510.96s)]
*  That seems like some sort of a real bug. [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13513.24s)]
*  I don't think it's a mantis, but it's something. [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13515.359999999999s)]
*  It's a mantis channel. [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13517.16s)]

*  Man, it's got mantis, uh, a pair of dirges. [[03:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13520.6s)]
*  He's like, hey! [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13524.0s)]
*  Jamie's an insect doctor. [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13525.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's, uh, whatever it is. [[03:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13527.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're lucky they're little. [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13530.0s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[03:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13532.0s)]
*  You're going to be OK. [[03:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13533.0s)]
*  I am. Are you? [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13534.32s)]
*  I think so. I think so, too. [[03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13535.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're all going to be fine. [[03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13537.16s)]
*  But I do think that we're we legitimately are going to become [[03:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13539.279999999999s)]
*  something different than we are now. [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13542.4s)]
*  Just like we are different than Little House on the Prairie. [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13544.0s)]
*  We are different. Sure. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13547.039999999999s)]
*  We're a different thing. We're a different thing. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13547.88s)]
*  And that thing that made us a different thing [[03:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13549.84s)]
*  is just the beginning. [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13552.800000000001s)]
*  It's just the tip of the iceberg. [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13554.36s)]
*  I guess we'll see. We're going to see. [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13556.56s)]
*  I think we're going to be OK. [[03:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13563.56s)]
*  But we're not. [[03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13565.48s)]
*  It's the real devil. [[03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13566.68s)]
*  That's the real devil. Look at those. [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13567.72s)]
*  Devil mantis. Devil mantis. [[03:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13569.32s)]
*  It looks very suggestive. Look at that. [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13571.04s)]
*  Is that? Oh, that's it's. [[03:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13572.800000000001s)]
*  OK, I thought that was it's other side. [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13573.68s)]
*  They're up in like a defensive pose. [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13575.92s)]
*  They're trying to strike. [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13577.48s)]
*  No, they're. I haven't seen that. [[03:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13580.68s)]
*  Those are weird. [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13582.12s)]
*  Just imagine if that's as big as a giraffe. [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13582.84s)]
*  I'm good. You know, I've seen the movie. [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13584.640000000001s)]
*  We watched Predator recently. [[03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13588.84s)]
*  That was and, you know, Predator was passionate. [[03:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13591.04s)]
*  You see the new one? Which one? [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13594.44s)]
*  Prey. I think so. [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13596.480000000001s)]
*  The Comanche girl. No, that's good. [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13598.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You got to. [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13600.52s)]
*  Got to settle into it. [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13602.2s)]
*  Suspension of disbelief. Very important. [[03:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13603.800000000001s)]
*  Again, Predator. Fun. [[03:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13606.12s)]
*  One of those moments where [[03:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13608.0s)]
*  Schwarzenegger's character was like [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13611.48s)]
*  about to smash his head with a rock. [[03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13614.44s)]
*  And then he's like, even though this guy, [[03:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13616.36s)]
*  this thing killed all his friends. [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13618.24s)]
*  And he's like, you know what? [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13620.32s)]
*  I think I'm going to let you live. [[03:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13622.2s)]
*  And then the thing tries to kill him again. [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13624.800000000001s)]
*  Like, why not just smash him with the rock? [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13627.28s)]
*  Hmm. Why give him that second chance? [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13630.560000000001s)]
*  What's the point? [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13632.76s)]
*  Plot line. [[03:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13634.640000000001s)]
*  Boo. Didn't like it. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13636.04s)]
*  I'm exhausted at that point. [[03:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13637.68s)]
*  I want to see this thing dead. [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13640.640000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Yeah. [[03:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13642.6s)]
*  You like the new one. The new one's cool. [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13644.720000000001s)]
*  OK. It's about the Comanches. [[03:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13646.28s)]
*  OK. The Comanches. [[03:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13648.44s)]
*  Oh, so it's like it's a it's a period piece. [[03:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13649.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. OK. A girl Comanche. [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13652.76s)]
*  Oh, I like that. Cool. It's good. [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13654.68s)]
*  Yeah. Bring it on. [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13656.32s)]
*  I was like, come on. [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13657.16s)]
*  It's pretty good. It's fun. [[03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13658.92s)]
*  It's fun. That's a you know, [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13661.04s)]
*  if aliens really are visiting us, [[03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13663.4s)]
*  that's the least of our concerns. [[03:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13665.0s)]
*  They're hunting us. Oh, yeah. [[03:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13666.16s)]
*  I think we literally be with like [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13667.28s)]
*  stepping on our arms. If they were hunting us, [[03:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13669.44s)]
*  we would probably be gone by now. [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13670.48s)]
*  I think at this point, they're just studying us and [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13672.199999999999s)]
*  I think for sure they're studying us. [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13674.84s)]
*  Figuring out what the hell is wrong with us. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13675.76s)]
*  I think for sure there is something from another world [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13677.84s)]
*  that observes us. [[03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13681.199999999999s)]
*  And I think it makes sense. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13682.68s)]
*  If there if there are a thing that are that advanced [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13684.039999999999s)]
*  that's out there, why wouldn't they keep an eye on us? [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13687.68s)]
*  And if there is a thing, they would understand how fragile [[03:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13690.44s)]
*  our fucking little psyches are. [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13693.119999999999s)]
*  Why would they let themselves be known? [[03:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13695.6s)]
*  I think there's a slow trickle of information [[03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13697.84s)]
*  as our technology expands and we'd be able to track things [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13700.84s)]
*  better and better radar systems and they're getting more [[03:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13704.199999999999s)]
*  and more data. And I think that's how it's supposed to be. [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13706.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's how we're supposed to figure it's not [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13709.32s)]
*  like they're going to land on the White House lawn. [[03:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13711.199999999999s)]
*  Hello, we are here with wisdom. [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13712.8s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[03:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13714.8s)]
*  But I think we're going to slowly become more and more [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13715.92s)]
*  aware of their existence because we're slowly going to have [[03:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13718.119999999999s)]
*  better and better systems that pick up things on Earth [[03:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13721.0s)]

*  I'm not sure if there's a difference between like God [[03:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13725.44s)]

*  Well, here's the thing. If that idea if if if human beings [[03:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13732.04s)]
*  create a cyborg and that cyborgs infinitely more [[03:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13737.480000000001s)]
*  intelligent than a human and the cyborg invents [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13740.800000000001s)]
*  a better cyborg and it keeps going until someone gets [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13743.800000000001s)]
*  to a point where they control black holes, they can create [[03:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13747.08s)]
*  new universe. That is a God. Right. [[03:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13749.480000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's what the creative force of the universe [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13751.4s)]
*  is going through us. [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13753.560000000001s)]
*  Maybe the idea that you are God. [[03:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13754.76s)]
*  It sounds so fucking we just watched that 90s movie [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13756.640000000001s)]

*  That was good. By the end, I was like I needed to go [[03:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13766.4s)]
*  take a walk in the sun. [[03:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13768.6s)]
*  Sam Neill, Lawrence Fishburne. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13769.36s)]
*  Solid movie. Yeah, that's that's a good movie. [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13771.52s)]
*  That was like a wormhole movie. [[03:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13774.52s)]
*  They went through a wormhole and satanic shit happened. [[03:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13775.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was like the underside of the. [[03:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13778.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was hell. It was hell. [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13781.8s)]
*  But I think if human beings can do what we can do, [[03:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13782.96s)]
*  being these weird primates and these weird talking animals [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13787.119999999999s)]
*  that have figured out how to manipulate our environment [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13791.759999999998s)]
*  and integrate with technology in a crazy way that no other animals [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13793.759999999998s)]
*  doing, it just seems to make sense to me that that if you could [[03:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13796.839999999998s)]
*  stay alive for a thousand years or a hundred thousand years, [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13802.08s)]
*  if human beings continue to evolve and stay alive, [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13806.16s)]
*  they will eventually assume the power of gods. [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13809.12s)]
*  I think that's what they're trying to do. [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13812.8s)]
*  Like, we already have the ability to kill everyone on the planet. [[03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13814.4s)]
*  If this stupid shit with Russia and Ukraine, if this goes down [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13817.32s)]
*  to the point where like nuclear weapons are exchanged between countries, [[03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13821.36s)]
*  there's enough nuclear weapons to kill. [[03:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13826.88s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be them. I think it's going to be China. [[03:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13828.68s)]
*  Why would you think that? A lot of reasons. [[03:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13832.16s)]
*  Yeah. I have to pee so badly. [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlFrS6jpP7M&t=13834.960000000001s)]
