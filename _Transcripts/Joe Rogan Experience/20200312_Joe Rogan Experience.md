# Joe Rogan Experience #1440 - Fortune Feimster
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ack8IjOdo3c)
*  Three, two, one, fortune!
*  What's up?
*  Good to see you.
*  What's happening?
*  You too.
*  This is exciting.
*  It's exciting for me too.
*  Our first date.
*  Do you have a special coming out or something?
*  It just came out like a month ago.
*  Oh it's out already?
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't even know.
*  Well there's a lot of specials coming out right now.
*  God damn, is this the craziest time ever for specials?
*  Yeah, it's like one after another after another.
*  It really is.
*  I can't remember ever in the history of comedy that there's been this many specials released.
*  No, and like just killers every week.
*  Yeah, speaking special.
*  Pull up the video of Tom Segura's new special.
*  Netflix is a joke on Instagram, has a copy of it.
*  Oh, because he's doing English and Spanish, right?
*  This one's just English and he's going to do one in Spanish.
*  People don't know that Tom Segura is fluent in Espanol.
*  He had his mom on his podcast and that was cool.
*  In Spanish!
*  Yeah, it's amazing.
*  Yeah, it's funny because he looks so white.
*  He looks like a white bro.
*  I know!
*  And then sometimes Mexicans will talk shit around him and he'll just look at them and
*  then say something in Spanish and they're like, oh no.
*  Oh, that's the best.
*  To have that secret weapon.
*  Especially in LA.
*  There's a video of him.
*  Is he a lip-singer?
*  That's what I was going to say!
*  Thank you!
*  Play the video.
*  I love you Tom, I love you Tom.
*  Play the video.
*  They fucked him.
*  He let some lady put make-up on me.
*  I never let them put make-up on me.
*  And they always bring someone and this is why.
*  They made him out.
*  And by the way, they color corrected it because it was way worse than that before.
*  He told me it was way worse than that.
*  I go, what the fuck bro?
*  He's like, I know.
*  I go, dude, you can't let them do that to you.
*  It looks like he kissed Christina and then went out to do the show.
*  He looks like a clown.
*  He looks like a clown from the 1930s.
*  Like one of them black and white movies.
*  Look at that.
*  That's crazy.
*  They put lipstick on him.
*  They put lipstick on him and they put white make-up all over his face.
*  I had that happen once.
*  Because you really can't tell when they're putting it on.
*  Someone made me look like the Marionette doll with the big red rosy cheeks.
*  I was hosting an award show and the whole speech is online.
*  It's so crazy because you let someone dictate what your image is going to be.
*  Someone that really has no business doing that.
*  They just do make-up.
*  And when someone does make-up, they want to do make-up.
*  They want to do ya.
*  But he just needs to put some chapstick on.
*  Ridiculous.
*  That's it.
*  Look, that's what he looks like.
*  That's what I always say.
*  I'm the only one in the UFC broadcast that doesn't put make-up on too.
*  And I'm like, we're talking to people that are getting their heads punched in.
*  Literally, Joanna Jacek, who's the former straw weight champion, she had a fight with
*  this woman, Zhang Weili, who is the straw weight champion from China.
*  It's crazy.
*  Epic.
*  Like, one of the best fights in history and at the end of it, Joanna's head was so sw-
*  like a Frankenstein forehead.
*  Imagine.
*  Crazy.
*  Look at her forehead.
*  Now imagine me with make-up on standing next to her.
*  That would be ridiculous, right?
*  I refuse.
*  You're like, look at my foundation.
*  They're like, well, we're just going to cut down on the shine.
*  Who gives a fuck if I'm shiny?
*  Literally, no one cares.
*  Yeah, she's got a double forehead now.
*  It's a double, triple forehead.
*  Everything's swollen.
*  Is it back down?
*  Have you really followed up?
*  I don't know.
*  She hasn't taken- that's what she looks like normally.
*  Beautiful lady.
*  She's so tough.
*  Yeah.
*  That lady is as tough as human beings can possibly be.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Because she like never even flinched.
*  Her fucking forehead's twice the size of normal.
*  She didn't even flinch.
*  Kept throwing bombs.
*  It was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Epic.
*  How long did it go?
*  Five rounds.
*  Five rounds.
*  Twenty-five whole minutes of chaos.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was even the whole fight.
*  It was like back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
*  It was amazing.
*  Are you guys super bummed out when people throw one punch and the person falls down?
*  No.
*  That's it?
*  That's exciting too?
*  Yeah, it's exciting.
*  The sport is crazy.
*  It can happen that way.
*  There was a recent fight where Donald Cerrone fought Conor McGregor.
*  In the clinch, Conor McGregor slammed his shoulder into Donald's nose and broke his
*  nose.
*  When he came out of the clinch, seconds into the fight, his nose is bleeding.
*  And then he got head kicked and then he got pummeled and they stopped the fight in 40
*  seconds.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Yeah.
*  And everybody was bummed out because it was this huge pay-per-view event.
*  It was a big deal.
*  But that's part of what's crazy about this sport is that fighting in either boxing, kickboxing,
*  or MMA is the only sport where you can end it early.
*  Like football goes the distance.
*  Yeah.
*  You're in for three and a half?
*  Four quarters.
*  Yeah.
*  Four hours.
*  Yeah.
*  But fighting can end in 10 seconds.
*  We've had fights that have ended, I think, well who's got the record now?
*  It was Dwayne Ludwig.
*  But...
*  Mosfetall took it I think, right?
*  That's right.
*  Mosfetall took it.
*  I think it was like eight seconds but it was like four or five.
*  It's not really.
*  I don't even think they gave it eight.
*  I think they said it's five but I think it's three.
*  What do you do at the live event?
*  Everyone's just like, all right, time to go.
*  Well, there's 12 fights that night.
*  Oh, gotcha.
*  So that was just one fight out of many, many, many, many fights.
*  I clearly know a lot about...
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever watched one live?
*  Yeah, not live but on TV.
*  You should go.
*  I'll get you tickets.
*  I love that.
*  You'll go crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  It looks so fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty fun.
*  But no one's ever invited me and I'm not proactive enough to be like, let me get some tickets.
*  Now you've been invited.
*  You bring your boy Tom Papa.
*  I will.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he needs to go too.
*  Yeah.
*  Bring his bread.
*  Has he...
*  I wonder if he's been to one.
*  I don't think he has.
*  I don't think so.
*  We're like, hey guys, we're here for the ZF fight.
*  Has Tom ever been to one?
*  I don't think so.
*  Probably not.
*  Maybe?
*  Jamie, it seems like maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe he showed up with Hannibal one time, a long time ago.
*  I can't remember.
*  Oh, maybe.
*  Oh yeah, maybe.
*  Tom's always up for anything.
*  Hannibal goes a lot.
*  He's kind of...
*  Hannibal's a gundle.
*  Oh really?
*  A gang of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  So you do that morning show with Tom.
*  I do, yeah.
*  I'm serious.
*  You enjoy it?
*  I love it except for the 530 wake up.
*  Yeah, that's horseshit.
*  Why do you guys have to do it that way?
*  Every comic that comes to the show is like, why are you waking up this early?
*  Because we're all doing spots so late.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this is the new world.
*  You don't have to do that anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a whole idea of like, it has to be on at 8 a.m.
*  Ready, go.
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  That's just how they set it up.
*  You know, 7 to 9 every morning, Monday through Thursday.
*  We're doing it for Netflix.
*  That's cool.
*  They have a new series, XM Channel.
*  That's very cool.
*  93.
*  They give you numbers?
*  They tell you how many people are listening?
*  They give you no information.
*  What the fuck?
*  We have no idea.
*  We have no idea.
*  We only know that people are listening because they call in.
*  That's the only way we know.
*  So you're just talking in mics.
*  You hope there's an audience.
*  It seems like there's one.
*  It's kind of fun though that way.
*  It would be kind of fun to do a show where no one could record it and it just goes out
*  live and there's no recording it at all.
*  That's what radio used to be.
*  Radio used to be, I mean, that's one of the fun things about the Howard Stern show back
*  in the day because it was so crazy for radio.
*  But you were hearing this and this was the only time you were ever going to hear it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I remember when his show was on the E! Channel.
*  That's right.
*  It was like him and Anna Nicole Smith's show.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  That's right.
*  I forgot she had a show.
*  Rest in peace, poor Anna.
*  She was one of the first, like, I mean, if Instagram was around, she would have been
*  one of the first Insta-hose.
*  Like a reality celebrity.
*  Everyone was following her life and her lawyer.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Howard, his name is Howard Stern.
*  J. Howard Marshall.
*  Oh no, no, no, different guy.
*  Yeah, I think it is Howard Stern.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, different Howard Stern.
*  So they had two Howard Sterns on the E! Channel.
*  And that was post divorce after her husband, well, not divorce, he died.
*  The old guy?
*  Yeah.
*  That was the best cash-in ever.
*  Her with him, it was the best cash-in ever.
*  He was like 95 years old in a wheelchair and she was a fucking bombshell.
*  She's like, love of my life.
*  Oh, look at that.
*  Did she get money?
*  Oh, hell yeah.
*  Because I know his kids were like fighting.
*  Yeah, they were trying to keep the money from her, but look, a deal's a deal.
*  That's always a bummer though.
*  If you were the kid of that guy.
*  I had a whole bit about it.
*  They're like, oh, he doesn't know what's up.
*  I go, he's a billionaire.
*  He's like 95 years old.
*  He made a billion dollars from scratch.
*  And my joke was, don't you think he's a tad crafty?
*  I think he knows what's going on.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  He doesn't have any time left.
*  But like, two kids or however many kids he has, they don't need a billion dollars.
*  Look at the size of his ears.
*  That's one weird thing that happens to old people, their ears keep growing.
*  I'm looking forward to having giant ass ears.
*  Their face shrinks.
*  I think I'm going to get my ears reduced when I hit 150.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  150.
*  That's what my plan is.
*  I'm going to get my ears reduced.
*  I'm just trying to make it to 50.
*  50, that's it?
*  That's all you want out of this life?
*  I want more.
*  I want more.
*  Dude, this fucking shit.
*  Coronavirus.
*  We had a guy on yesterday talking about the coronavirus.
*  Oh, man, I heard.
*  It's not good.
*  I heard that he was in here.
*  It's nerve wracking.
*  It's not good.
*  Well, because you don't really know what's coming.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  There's a whole bunch of other diseases that we discussed too, like chronic wasting disease.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  There's a lot of shit that's on the table that could happen to people.
*  There's all these pandemics that are possible.
*  Well, aren't there, like, because certain things are melting, certain diseases that
*  are sort of being uncovered from...
*  That's a theory, yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Yeah, that's a theory that the permafrost is going to release when it gets melted.
*  It's going to release some ancient bacteria that we don't have an immunity to.
*  Oh, man.
*  It's possible.
*  It's all possible.
*  It's good times right now.
*  There's something that happens with any time you have overpopulation.
*  And one of the things that happens is nature starts to try to course correct.
*  Nature's like, there's too many.
*  There's too many.
*  Let's do something.
*  And it happens with animals.
*  They get diseases, and a bunch of them die off.
*  And it happens with people as well.
*  It's not a coincidence that this disease came out of China, which is heavily overpopulated,
*  which has these...
*  He was talking to us in depth about these wet markets that they have in China, where
*  they have all these animals that they sell.
*  And they're all just laying around.
*  What is...
*  He said it was like chickens, and what was above the chickens was civets?
*  Any chickens were over those.
*  They were dropping their shit on them or something like that.
*  And it was civets below, right?
*  Yeah.
*  There was some weird combination with that.
*  Right.
*  He was saying, like, with crossover diseases, that's like a test tube.
*  You're literally doing experiments.
*  Right.
*  It's like the perfect test tube, perfect environment for creating a new disease.
*  Yeah.
*  As we've seen, wasn't this started from bats?
*  Yes.
*  Some people are eating bats over there.
*  Bro.
*  Ooh.
*  Bro.
*  I'm a sweet and sour chicken gal myself.
*  Sweet and sour chicken sounds good right now.
*  Sweet and sour bat.
*  Bats is what you eat when you're starving to death.
*  I mean, yeah, that's true.
*  Slim pickings in certain places.
*  Well, China, again, has a fucking billion people.
*  And when you see the stuff that they're eating over there, there was a salamander that they had that was like, I mean, like the size of your thigh bone.
*  It was huge.
*  Enormous fucking salamander.
*  They're holding it down with a meat cleaver.
*  It's a heck up to salamander.
*  They're like, it's all food.
*  Look at that bat.
*  Oh, man.
*  Oh, bro.
*  That's gnarly.
*  And they got the wings spread to let you know it's a good one.
*  That's a big bat.
*  It's a juicy bat.
*  A lot of meat there.
*  Do we have bats?
*  Do we have bats that big?
*  I don't believe we do.
*  I feel like they were always like, yay, big.
*  In America, if we had bats that big, we'd whack them.
*  We'd be like, that's enough.
*  That's enough for you, you fucks.
*  Back to the Stone Age.
*  I only saw bats when we had swim meets.
*  Look at those fucking things.
*  Look at the mouths on those things.
*  Open that up.
*  What is that?
*  What the fuck is those little werewolves?
*  That is crazy.
*  Bro, what are the mouths on those things?
*  Yeah, those like sharp teeth.
*  Those bats with the wings chopped off.
*  No way.
*  Is it?
*  Oh, man.
*  I guess I've never seen a bat up close.
*  Like no arm or something.
*  Whoa, dude, I think you're right.
*  Find out what that is.
*  I need to know.
*  Those are huge.
*  Clearly, they're popular because that's a lot of bats for sale.
*  I wonder if they're delicious.
*  Imagine we're missing out.
*  Oh, those are bats.
*  Those are bats.
*  They are bats.
*  Oh, God, that is what they look like.
*  What do they do with the wings?
*  Look at the fucking teeth on those monsters.
*  Imagine if they were like the size of a horse flying around.
*  A dragon.
*  Yeah, that is a dragon.
*  Look at the teeth on those fuckers.
*  It doesn't even look real.
*  Yeah.
*  I like how when they die, their mouths are open, like they're still trying to bite you.
*  Just to let you know, you got to be hungry as fuck.
*  Where is that?
*  I'm going to haunt you.
*  Did you say that was in Indonesia?
*  Is that what it said?
*  Yeah, I just typed in bats in the wet market so we could see what they look like.
*  My dog threw up in my car today and I caught it in a coffee cup.
*  Oh, wow, that's impressive.
*  Well, he was sitting in the front seat and sometimes he gets sick, especially when he
*  just eats.
*  Yeah.
*  And I saw the...
*  Yeah.
*  They start moving and I just put a coffee cup right where his mouth is while I was driving.
*  And he filled the coffee cup up.
*  Yeah, I have a little dog who will just throw up out of nowhere.
*  Dogs throw up.
*  But they do give you warning, which is nice.
*  We always grab them and pull them off the couch.
*  Well, when you're driving, you know, the fortunate thing is he's sitting right next to me in
*  the front seat.
*  Yeah, he's so cute.
*  He's adorable, isn't he?
*  That's a good dog.
*  He's a sweetie pie.
*  You got to love that dog.
*  I've never had a golden retriever before.
*  That's my first one, but they're the best dogs ever.
*  That's like a classic dog.
*  Yeah, they're so sweet.
*  Yeah, loyal.
*  They just want love.
*  That's all they want.
*  Cuddly.
*  Just want to hang out with you and give you kisses and go on walks and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  My dogs are like six and a half pounds.
*  What are they?
*  What do you have?
*  One's a Pomeranian, and this is a little guy.
*  Those are cute little dogs, but they're a little yappy.
*  They are, but we got one that is not yappy.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  You got lucky.
*  We had the jackpot.
*  And then the other one's a like terrier chihuahua mix.
*  She's like eight pounds.
*  Oh, wow.
*  But they guard our house.
*  Like they're going to cause some damage.
*  Well, they're good guards in that they let you know something's up.
*  Like if someone's out there, they're like, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  So if you've got a gun, that's probably the best way.
*  I don't have a gun.
*  You don't have a gun?
*  No.
*  You want one?
*  I don't know.
*  I would want to learn how to use it first.
*  Oh, for sure you should.
*  Yeah, because I don't want to just have one.
*  Someone would be in trouble.
*  Would you be in trouble?
*  I would.
*  I've been to shooting ranges for sure.
*  I mean, I'm from North Carolina.
*  That's part of the culture.
*  Yeah.
*  And I went to randomly Luke Bryan's house and shot guns for the first time.
*  He's buddies with my buddy Cam Haines.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're real close.
*  I've never met him.
*  He's a cool dude.
*  I heard he's the best.
*  I went to a charity event they had at their house and it's so nice.
*  But he had skeet shooting.
*  I didn't get to do that.
*  But then they had some like rifle shooting.
*  That's the way to live.
*  And then the long.
*  Rifle?
*  Yeah.
*  The long thing.
*  You know, the long thing.
*  The barrel part.
*  Here's what's crazy though.
*  My partner, she acted like, oh, what's this?
*  It's a rifle.
*  Hmm.
*  How do you use one of these?
*  And then there's a five target.
*  She goes, pow, pow, pow, pow.
*  Hits every single one of them.
*  And I was like, what?
*  She's sandbagging.
*  She's lying to you.
*  She's lying to me.
*  Yeah.
*  That bitch has been practicing while you're at work.
*  She's out there shooting.
*  If you see me on Dateline.
*  Uh oh.
*  I know.
*  You heard it here first.
*  I'll let everybody know.
*  Yeah. Thank you.
*  That bitch is sandbagging.
*  Man.
*  She's got a Punisher t-shirt hidden away in her closet.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, I would want to learn the gun safety.
*  How to use it better.
*  That's pretty straightforward though.
*  I mean, they could teach you that in just a few minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  As long as you're paying attention.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, you know, make sure the safety's on.
*  Make sure there's nothing in the chamber.
*  Keep your finger off the trigger.
*  Don't ever point it at somebody even when it's not loaded.
*  That's where, when you hear about people doing really stupid things, it's just, that's what it is.
*  It's just not respecting gun safety.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Was that some Instagrammer or TikTok or some guy shot his fucking computer accidentally?
*  Yeah, I'm sure he was on Twitch.
*  Twitch.
*  Twitch.
*  Oh, geez.
*  Moron.
*  He thought it was unloaded and he pulled the trigger on his computer and fucking shot around through his computer.
*  It's like video-taming him and then it disappears.
*  Silly bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  My brother's in the military so he's...
*  Here it is.
*  Let's watch this guy.
*  Try again.
*  Maybe.
*  Did they remove it?
*  Sometimes when you hit that video to play on Twitter, it doesn't play the first time.
*  You mean when it's embedded in someone's...
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, when it's embedded in someone's page.
*  Oh, yeah, no, it is taken down.
*  Oh, man.
*  Oh, unavailable.
*  You cannot see this.
*  How are they going to take that down?
*  This is too real.
*  It's too real, man.
*  We don't want you to know that that happens.
*  He shot his Yeti Cup, is that what it is?
*  Oh, he did.
*  He shot a bunch of things.
*  It was honestly like death.
*  I was about to say...
*  It went right through his computer screen, I think.
*  It like ricocheted.
*  Whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  What happens to someone like that?
*  They take their gun away?
*  They should.
*  It's against the law, I think, right?
*  Because you like just fire it off on your house?
*  Just fire it off on your house on accident or something like that or you can get fined, I think.
*  Yeah, you can't get fined if you shoot an intruder.
*  If you shoot a person, you're all right.
*  Oh, that's okay.
*  If you shoot your computer...
*  Even if you shoot a person...
*  Like in Texas, you can kind of...
*  You could shoot...
*  I remember a story where a guy was repoing a guy's car.
*  A guy hadn't made payments on his truck, I believe.
*  And the repo guy was opening up the door with the slim gem and getting into his car.
*  And the guy reached out the window with a rifle and shot the guy in his driveway.
*  Dang.
*  Yeah, and they didn't charge him.
*  They really?
*  Yeah, they said someone was breaking into your car as far as you knew.
*  It's on your property.
*  Okay.
*  But I mean, he killed this fucking repo guy.
*  Man.
*  But then you hear stories about people getting sued if they shoot somebody that was trying to break into their house.
*  That's in other states.
*  In other states, yeah, you can get sued.
*  I mean, which is crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  Somebody breaking into your house, you're kind of, you know, backs against the wall.
*  Well, you're supposed to assume that they're not going to hurt you.
*  When they've already made the commitment to enter your home by force, they're already doing something insanely risky.
*  The idea that you're supposed to somehow or another, like, warn them as much as you can and then...
*  I mean, I kind of get it.
*  Like, what if it's a teenage kid that doesn't know any better and they're just stupid and they're with their friends
*  and they think it's funny to rob someone's house?
*  I don't know.
*  It's just...
*  It's...
*  It's both ways, right?
*  It's like, it's horrible that people have guns and they can just shoot you and kill you.
*  But it's also horrible if you can't have a gun to protect yourself from someone who wants to kill you.
*  Right.
*  Both things are horrible.
*  If no one had guns, the world would be a way better place.
*  But then we'd be at the mercy of, like, giant people.
*  That's true.
*  They would just run everything.
*  So it's the equalizer.
*  Yeah, guys like the mountain from the Game of Thrones, he would just be the king of the world.
*  Everybody would have to shut the fuck up.
*  If there was no weapons...
*  What are we going to do?
*  That's what it was.
*  Before, people figured out sticks and spears and rocks and stuff.
*  Like, the biggest humans just fucking ran shit.
*  We just, like, let them.
*  But then someone figured out a bow and arrow.
*  Like, that motherfucker, when he gets close, it's a problem.
*  Well, if he's not on the way, on the way to me, I'm going to fucking whack him.
*  And then I'm going to start running shit.
*  I like bow and arrows.
*  Yeah?
*  You shot that?
*  Yeah.
*  Not the gun.
*  The old school.
*  See, that's what a crossbow is.
*  It's a shitty gun.
*  It's not really a bow.
*  Like, people call it a bow.
*  Like, come on, that's not a bow.
*  That's true.
*  It's got a trigger.
*  You got a scope.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah, Daryl, Walking Dead.
*  Yeah.
*  That Walking Dead show is ridiculous.
*  He never runs out of arrows.
*  Never runs out of arrows and he never gets a pass through.
*  It's been like 60 years he's been in the zombie apocalypse.
*  Unlimited.
*  These zombies are so soft, you could walk up to them, stab them in the skull, and your
*  knife will go through their skull.
*  No problem.
*  Try stabbing someone in the skull.
*  That shit's hard.
*  I have never.
*  It bounces off.
*  It's not easy.
*  You can go, just try it.
*  It's not easy.
*  You have to be really fucking strong and you got to hit a good spot.
*  You got to hit a soft spot like a temple.
*  But like, he just goes right through them with that stupid arrow, but then it never
*  passes through.
*  Right.
*  Never goes right through.
*  Then he just grabs it.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's ready to go again.
*  No problem.
*  Not only that, he doesn't even have broadheads on him.
*  He's got field tips.
*  Those tips on his arrow, they're like little tiny, they'll make a pencil hole.
*  Like what that is is for practice.
*  He's got practice tips on his fucking arrows.
*  He doesn't even have broadheads.
*  There's some holes in these plots.
*  A lot of holes.
*  That show I used to love.
*  I loved that show for the first few seasons.
*  It was a great show for like the first two or three seasons.
*  I watched it up until Rick, the main guy, left.
*  Oh, I didn't get that far.
*  And a little spoiler alert.
*  Yeah.
*  When they killed Glenn, I was like, I'm done.
*  The day they killed Glenn.
*  That was a bummer.
*  It was the way they did it too.
*  It was like, what?
*  And you guys got no respect for your main characters.
*  Smashing his head in.
*  And I saw the dude who played Glenn.
*  I saw him out somewhere.
*  I want to say it was out of UFC.
*  He might have been out of UFC in the crowd.
*  He was somewhere in the crowd, but he looked depressed.
*  Oh, like he was bummed out about his character getting killed that way?
*  I mean, can you imagine if you're on a show and you're one of the big players on the show?
*  I mean, he was one of the main guys.
*  And one of the more interesting guys.
*  And he's on the show for five, six years or whatever it was.
*  And then one day they just baseball bat you.
*  This new guy.
*  Baseball bats you.
*  So not only is this new guy on the show who's getting all the heat, but now he baseball bats you to death.
*  And then you're just out there in public and probably people are like mocking you on social media.
*  If you're not smart, you read that shit and you feel all bummed out.
*  And that was at the height of its success.
*  You're like, you're going to go out now?
*  I know.
*  You can't wait till Rick leaves?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, once Rick left, it's dead, right?
*  I mean, they've kept it going, but I haven't.
*  Who's on it now?
*  Is the chick with the sword still there?
*  She was, but she's leaving soon.
*  Didn't like what he got.
*  Because his son's gone too.
*  Rick's son, Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Carl.
*  Yeah.
*  My buddy, Josh McDermott's on there.
*  Yes, I know Josh real well.
*  He's Eugene.
*  Yeah, Josh was on the podcast early on the show.
*  Like early.
*  And we were like, dude, I can't believe you're on the fucking Walking Dead.
*  I know.
*  I knew Josh from way back in the day.
*  Josh worked with me at the Tempe Improv.
*  He was doing an open mic contest, I think on Thursday, on Wednesday or Thursday.
*  And then we went, we got in there early because we had to do radio back then.
*  And Josh was on stage.
*  He was really funny.
*  And I said, hey man, you want to work with us all week?
*  And he's like, fuck yeah.
*  And so he worked with us all week.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  He's a good guy.
*  Really good guy.
*  Funny dude.
*  Yeah, a lot of people don't know he started, I mean, that's his thing.
*  He was a standup comedian.
*  Well, is he still doing standup?
*  Not much, not much.
*  That sucks.
*  Yeah, because he has to be in Atlanta so much.
*  But he does like a play in New York.
*  In New York.
*  Ew.
*  Ew.
*  Ew, there he is.
*  He can play Bill Hicks in a movie.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If they ever do a Bill Hicks movie, especially with that haircut that they gave him.
*  He'd be good.
*  Oh, he'd be fucking perfect.
*  But he kind of went off the radar a little bit because the fans are so fanatical that
*  he, it was just like a lot on Instagram and social media and it was too much.
*  And he just went off all that stuff.
*  Oh, did he really?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That's not good once you're done though.
*  Yeah.
*  I know, I was like, you might need to go back on.
*  Once you start doing the fucking improv again.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to need that shit.
*  Unless he just decides he's going to be an actor now.
*  Yeah, he might because he really loves acting.
*  But I remember he couldn't tell anybody that he had gotten the show.
*  Yeah, I remember that too.
*  And suddenly he had a mullet.
*  And we're like, I mean, not that I'm one to criticize someone's hair, but I'm like, dude,
*  what are you doing?
*  This is before Theo made the mullet cool.
*  He kind of did, but not really.
*  It's really just a punchline.
*  He owns it though.
*  He owns it.
*  He lives it.
*  He is it.
*  He embodies it.
*  Yeah.
*  But it didn't, with Josh's mullet, isn't it, the hair is like glued on though, right?
*  It's like some crazy wig thing.
*  They might put some pieces, but he grew it out and dyed it dark.
*  Wow.
*  And then he, then I was at a wedding with him when the announcement came out.
*  Look at him.
*  Look at him.
*  Look at that sexy bitch.
*  I think that's his hair.
*  I don't know about the top part.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they glue a lot in there.
*  They might.
*  Looks good though.
*  Give him some extensions.
*  He can rock that shit.
*  Look at the upper left hand corner.
*  That one where your cursor's at, that looks good.
*  That's like a hot dude from the 80s.
*  You know?
*  Like a dude who just pulls up in a Trans Am.
*  That's right.
*  You're like, that's who I want to be with.
*  That guy.
*  One of those gold chains.
*  Were those Heather, what are they called?
*  What's those flat gold chains called?
*  You know what I'm talking about?
*  I want to say like Heather Cut or something like that.
*  I think my dad had one.
*  Of course he did.
*  He was going through a midlife crisis.
*  Got himself a gold chain.
*  You have a gold chain?
*  You know how a guy would show up with a gold chain?
*  You're like, are you, what are you up to?
*  Some dudes can pull it off.
*  Black guys can pull it off.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something about white dudes with more than one gold chain.
*  It's really atrocious.
*  I'll tell you who couldn't pull it off.
*  Who?
*  My dad.
*  My mom's just like, get out of here.
*  It's like when guys out of nowhere start wearing a bunch of rings.
*  Like skull rings, those big pewter or silver rings.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do that.
*  Either you used to do that and you don't anymore or you just don't.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't just start it or a thumb ring.
*  Right.
*  Out of nowhere.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, what's going on with you?
*  Yeah.
*  When I first met Bourdain, he had a thumb ring.
*  Oh, really?
*  I'm like, what are you doing, man?
*  So I put that thumb ring.
*  And he's like, I'm too old for this thing.
*  And he abandoned it.
*  Yeah.
*  He abandoned it after a while.
*  Maybe you thought it would catch on.
*  Like, oh, if I wear a thumb ring.
*  I think it was kind of cool for a little bit.
*  You know?
*  You don't see them much.
*  No.
*  I don't see a thumb ring.
*  It is weird that we decide.
*  Like this finger's fine.
*  This finger's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  This finger's fine.
*  This is an acceptable ring finger.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thumb is like, what are you doing, stupid?
*  Or a pinky ring.
*  Like, what are you, in the mafia?
*  Bro, what are you in the mafia?
*  Joey Diaz has an American Indian pinky ring that he wears.
*  And you know why he wears it?
*  Because he can't get it off.
*  He put it on and he gained weight and it stuck forever.
*  That sounds about right.
*  He's like, what am I going to do?
*  What the fuck am I going to do, cocksucker?
*  I'm sure it'll come off.
*  I'm just joking.
*  But I think I always wonder if that's what it is.
*  Because I always see him with that fucking ring on.
*  Now that everybody's having to wash their hands, maybe it'll slip off.
*  It doesn't help.
*  It's not helping?
*  No.
*  Michael Osterholm was saying it's not going to help you.
*  Oh, come on.
*  No, it's airborne.
*  It's airborne.
*  It's in the air.
*  People breathing, coughing.
*  You're around people.
*  If you're close to people and they're breathing on you, you're going to get it.
*  It's touches.
*  If you touch things, you're going to get it too, though.
*  I mean, maybe it'll help a little bit if you wash your hands a lot.
*  But it's, you know, crowded places is where it's going to be an issue.
*  Pearl Jam apparently just canceled all their gigs.
*  I saw that.
*  Up until late April.
*  And they were playing Madison, Motherfucking Square Garden.
*  They canceled that.
*  Yeah.
*  They canceled some big gigs.
*  Yeah.
*  I know my tour, my tour's starting and I'm like, really?
*  Everybody's tour.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been on these text threads with all my friends and like, are you canceling any dates?
*  Like, what are you hearing?
*  I think everybody's kind of waiting.
*  Like, comic wise, no one's canceled, I don't think.
*  Like, I haven't seen comics canceling.
*  So maybe everybody's kind of waiting to see.
*  Because it's almost like a ripple effect.
*  Once one goes, you're like, oh, here goes another one, here goes another one.
*  Right. You feel like you have to.
*  Like South by Southwest kind of felt like is going to have a ripple effect.
*  They're saying Coachella is going to be October.
*  Did you see Elon Musk's tweet on Coachella?
*  What did he say?
*  They should postpone a Coachella until it stops sucking.
*  I've actually...
*  They tweeted back to him too.
*  Did you see their response?
*  No, pull it up.
*  Yeah, I'm going to find the one.
*  I've never been to Coachella.
*  I've never been either.
*  I'm a grown ass man.
*  That's not my grown...
*  What am I going to do? Have a bandana?
*  Yeah, because...
*  Because he was there with a car?
*  No, that's Jaden Smith flew a Model X over the crowd.
*  Wait, Will Smith's son plays at Coachella?
*  Well, that makes Elon right.
*  That means he's correct.
*  That was a good idea. He liked it.
*  Okay, fine, that was a good idea. Ha ha.
*  Well, that was good. Ha ha.
*  He only liked that part because it's so visible.
*  People know that Elon Musk is reading his tweets.
*  How does he have time?
*  He has 16 different jobs.
*  He made all his money.
*  He's on Twitter all the time.
*  How is that possible though?
*  He's tweeting memes.
*  Right, but how is it possible?
*  Maybe he just hires people to do all this stuff now.
*  He's like, you guys got it.
*  No, he's very hands on.
*  When the Model 3 production was underway,
*  he was telling me that he was working 16 hours a day.
*  Dang.
*  Yeah, he was in the factory 16 hours a day.
*  Maybe he gives himself a little bit of a break and then he goes on tweet storms.
*  He's like, I'm going to the bathroom.
*  But that guy's tweets have cost him millions of dollars.
*  I know.
*  But he's still tweeting.
*  He doesn't care.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  But that's how much money, when you have a lot of money,
*  you're just like, whatever.
*  Yeah, I'm just tweeting bitch, which is going to do.
*  Yeah, when he wrote Tesla stock selling private at 420
*  or secured at 420, like as a joke.
*  Oh.
*  He's got like weird 420 jokes, but he doesn't even smoke weed.
*  Like when he smoked weed on my podcast, he barely inhaled.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think he really smokes weed, but he makes a lot of 420 jokes.
*  Maybe he smokes weed on the sneak tip and just didn't want to in front of everybody.
*  So he didn't want to be rude because I was offering.
*  So just took a little bit.
*  And yeah, he's like, it is legal.
*  I'm like, yes, legal, bro.
*  It is.
*  He's too smart.
*  It's uncomfortable.
*  Yeah, because I wouldn't know what to talk with him about.
*  Imagine talking to regular idiots.
*  Like when he's sitting out there talking like me, I felt bad talking to me.
*  I felt bad.
*  But you know a lot of stuff.
*  I know.
*  You're well, you're well read.
*  Yeah, I know a lot of dumb shit.
*  That's good, though.
*  I have like a like a peripheral knowledge, a cursory understanding of things.
*  It seemed like you remember a lot of things that you do read.
*  Yeah, that's where it's tricky.
*  That's where it appears that I'm intelligent.
*  I just have a good memory.
*  Yeah, I just remember things because I'll read things and it'll go, you know, I'll be like, oh, yeah, I read that book.
*  I couldn't tell you what I read like a year later.
*  It's gone.
*  That happens to me, too, though.
*  Yeah, I only have a memory for things that I think are interesting.
*  If I think something's interesting, I remember it.
*  But if my wife tells me some shit, I don't give a fuck.
*  I forget it five minutes after she told me.
*  Did you hear it?
*  She'll say it again and I'll go, what are you talking about?
*  And she goes, I just talked to you about that.
*  I'm like, when?
*  She's like five minutes ago.
*  I'm like, I blocked you out.
*  Yeah, I do that same thing.
*  I'm like, what?
*  She's like, you never listen.
*  I'm like, no, I heard you.
*  Can you tell me what it was again?
*  I heard you.
*  I know, I heard you.
*  I heard you, bitch.
*  It works well for memorizing scripts, though, for the short-term memory.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll remember, I can learn a script super quick.
*  Oh, really?
*  Do the lines and then it's gone forever.
*  Well, I feel like as stand-ups, we have to have a memory.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you're on stage for a fucking hour.
*  Yeah, and the only reason I'm able to remember my sets,
*  because it's so much repetition.
*  Some people bring notes on stage, but I always find that to be a big distraction.
*  I feel like Bill Maher brings a fucking concert pianist's stands.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  And he looks at the notes and passes over them.
*  Like if you're an inquirer.
*  Yeah.
*  I got you.
*  Music stand.
*  A music stand.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, like a podium.
*  I have brought notes on stage, and as soon as I start talking,
*  I put it down and never look at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it feels odd to stop the rhythm to be like,
*  let me see what my notes are.
*  You're like, just go with it and see what happens.
*  Well, if you have new shit you're working on, then I understand it.
*  Then, I've seen guys go on stage and they have new shit.
*  Yeah.
*  But sometimes people go on stage with notes just to let you know
*  they're working on new stuff.
*  It's almost like it lessens your expectations.
*  Right.
*  Like, this is all new.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they'll do old jokes.
*  I just flat out tell them, I don't have a punchline to this.
*  I'm going to make you go on this five minute journey,
*  and then it's going to peter out.
*  Do you feel like sometimes that's how you find the punchline?
*  Yeah.
*  I did a show Saturday night.
*  I go, I don't have a punchline to this.
*  You guys have any suggestions?
*  And they legitimately, like three dudes raised their hand.
*  Well, you could do, I was like, oh, you took me literally.
*  Okay.
*  Well, what do you got?
*  It was all garbage.
*  Well, you never know.
*  You never know.
*  You never know.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm doing that show tonight at the store,
*  Stand Up on the Spot.
*  Have you ever done that?
*  Mm-mm.
*  It's Jeremiah Watkins' show.
*  He's asked me, but it's...
*  You should do it.
*  It's really fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it used to be called Thunder Pussy,
*  which is a way better name.
*  And it actually is something that I used to do at the end of my shows.
*  At the end of my shows, I used to do a Q&A,
*  and I stole that from Jerry Seinfeld.
*  Oh, right.
*  Before I ever did comedy.
*  I was like 19.
*  I took my girlfriend to see Jerry Seinfeld at the Paradise in Boston.
*  Yeah.
*  And at the end of the show, he gets requests from the audience.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  They raise their hand.
*  Paradise is a small theater.
*  I want to say maybe 300, 400 people.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  It was a fairly small place.
*  It was cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Or an intimate place to see Jerry.
*  Did he know these questions were coming?
*  No.
*  Like, did he say...
*  Nope.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Nope.
*  They just were like, we want to find out.
*  Yeah, so he did like an hour of stand-up,
*  and then afterwards, he actually says,
*  thank you very much, thank you very much.
*  And then he says, I'm going to take some questions from the crowd,
*  you know, if you have any questions.
*  Okay, gotcha.
*  And then some guy says, how do you feel about the big dig?
*  Because there's this big thing going on in Boston
*  when they were digging tunnels.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And he went on this whole impromptu, improvised rant on the big dig,
*  and then someone yelled out something about something.
*  Now, he did it for a while.
*  It's like, that is a great way to come up with material.
*  Yeah.
*  Particularly at the end of your show.
*  So I did that for a while.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  But then it got to be too draggy.
*  It was like, I'm going to go to the theater.
*  I'm going to go to the theater.
*  I did that for a while.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  But then it got to be too draggy.
*  Like, you never know when to end it.
*  Right.
*  So I do an hour of stand-up,
*  and then an hour of that nonsense.
*  Oh, that's a long time.
*  And you see people yawning.
*  That's a long time.
*  What am I doing?
*  Torturing these poor fucks.
*  Well, because sometimes in that, you can find some real gold,
*  and then other times it's just like...
*  Diggin' through shit.
*  No one cares.
*  Yeah.
*  Diggin' through shit, looking for diamonds.
*  For sure.
*  Just another shovel of shit.
*  I'm like getting crowd work.
*  You're like, where do you work?
*  And it's something lame.
*  You're like, and where do you work?
*  How do you write, Fortune?
*  I write.
*  I go to the computer and write it all out.
*  That's what's up.
*  Knuckles.
*  Boom.
*  That's how I do it.
*  Do you do that?
*  Yes.
*  I cannot...
*  Some people are like, oh, I write on stage.
*  I'm like, no, no, no.
*  I'll find punchlines on stage, but I have to know where I'm going.
*  Good for you.
*  But I was a journalist for seven years.
*  Were you really?
*  Yeah, I was an entertainment journalist.
*  No kidding.
*  It was my day job while I was pursuing comedy at night.
*  How'd you get that gig?
*  Very random.
*  I was the student speaker at my college graduation.
*  And this actress was the commencement speaker, and she hired me to come out to LA and be
*  her assistant.
*  And her neighbor wrote for like the LA Daily News, and she's like, I heard you're a good
*  writer from your speech in college.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  It seemed to go well.
*  She's like, do you want to write for me?
*  Cover events and stuff, and it'll be in the LA Daily News.
*  I was like 23.
*  I was like, yeah, sure.
*  Why not?
*  So I just like became a journalist.
*  I had to just like learn how to do it.
*  So it was going to like movie premieres or like the Grammys, Oscars, Emmys.
*  I talked to celebrities on the phone and would write stories.
*  It wasn't like gossip.
*  It was more like, what are you working on?
*  Tell me about the project and what are you doing next?
*  And what was it like working so and so?
*  So I was like getting to learn all this stuff about the business.
*  And were you trying to make them funny or were you just like...
*  Just laying it out.
*  Laying out the interview and what they said.
*  And then that job led to a syndicated column.
*  So I was writing.
*  So it became full time for the next six years.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So I wrote all day from like nine to six.
*  And then I would do events at night.
*  And then I started doing comedy like two years into that.
*  Wow.
*  So you would write all day and then do comedy at night.
*  So while you were writing, would you say, oh, this could be funny and then set it aside?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I always was requesting to go to funny movies.
*  I knew I could interview comedians or go to...
*  Sarah Silverman had a show on Comedy Central.
*  I was like, oh, can I go to set and interview all the comics?
*  So I was gathering knowledge that way, knowing that I love comedy.
*  But I was never that person who was like, I do comedy.
*  Because I'm brand new in the stand up.
*  But it was more of just like, it taught me the skill of just getting to the story faster.
*  What's the interesting part of this interview?
*  What's the interesting part of this story?
*  And getting to that helped me just be a better writer.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great skill to have when you craft in bits.
*  I never knew when I started stand up that it would be so much writing.
*  Obviously, now that I'm a stand up, I'm like, duh, you have to have material.
*  But going into it, you just don't realize the content that you need to create.
*  Well, there's a big mistake that many comics make where they do just write on stage.
*  And then they have these sort of rambling intros to a bit or a bit.
*  Maybe they have something there, but they don't sit down in front of a computer for
*  hours and just try to pick it apart.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Try to find the best way to do it.
*  But if they did that, they would cut down on the process of creating that bit.
*  You can get to the end.
*  Some guys are just great at just figuring out how to shorten things up and get to the
*  point really quick.
*  But some people are not.
*  And they get comfortable with kind of half-assing it.
*  And then they stick to that form through the entire bit.
*  And you'll see the bit, and you're like, hey, man, that bit would be so much better if you
*  chopped out half of the words.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And I mean, I'm definitely more of a storyteller.
*  So that's why I like to sit down and write it.
*  Because I'm not doing set up punchline, set up punchline.
*  I'm telling a story, but I'm trying to make it funny on the way there.
*  And so for me, I have to write because I have to see what it looks like.
*  Because I'm like, oh, that sentence is really bland.
*  What one word can I put in there that just you're like, oh, I see it now.
*  I see what that is.
*  Yeah.
*  Instead of just being like a ball.
*  You're finding something more unique about it.
*  I tell people there's four steps to creating material.
*  And you could just do one.
*  The one you can do is you can just do it on stage.
*  Right.
*  And you will come up with an act.
*  Or you can write in front of your computer or in front of a notebook.
*  And then you go on stage, you improvise on stage, and then you listen to your sets.
*  Right.
*  Those are the steps.
*  Those are all the steps.
*  So you could fuck off on the other three and just go on stage.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're a good comic and you can figure out how to develop an act that way.
*  But I really think you're doing yourself a disservice.
*  And comics come up with this bullshit like, oh, I write on stage.
*  I'm like, I do too.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, I do too.
*  Yeah, you're finding stuff all the time.
*  I sit down and there's some of my best punchlines have come from sitting in front of the fucking
*  computer.
*  Yeah, because you're pushing yourself too.
*  Yes.
*  You're like, this is not good.
*  I'll stare at my computer for an hour until I find like even if it's one sentence.
*  Right, right, right.
*  That makes it better.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And that's so valuable.
*  You can do 100 sets and never change your bit.
*  But you could have like one hour session in front of a computer where you're like, oh,
*  oh.
*  Yeah.
*  You're alone with nothing else and no distractions.
*  And you can look at the stuff.
*  Like it just makes sense that with focus and time, you can create better.
*  Yeah.
*  It just makes sense.
*  So you can look at it better.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what I was doing when I was prepping for this Netflix special.
*  I wrote it all out.
*  It was like 18 pages, something like that.
*  And then I was always going on stage and working it out, taping it, listening to it, and then
*  constantly moving this paragraph, moving this.
*  It was all, all of the work was done at the computer, like moving it to where it needed
*  to be.
*  Do you use a program or anything to move stuff around?
*  No, I just, I use Word.
*  Yeah.
*  Word's fun.
*  There's a program called Scrivener.
*  Have you ever heard of it?
*  I like it a lot because what I do is I'll put all of the subjects on the left column.
*  Right, yeah.
*  And then labeled.
*  And then when you click on each one, it'll be the whole bit.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  But I don't write in it.
*  I don't write in Word.
*  Right.
*  Or I write in, I used to write in something called Write Room, but that was when I was
*  writing on a Mac.
*  Yeah.
*  And the problem is with the Macs, their laptop keyboards suck.
*  Oh no, you were saying there's something you discovered.
*  Think pads.
*  Yeah.
*  Lenovo think pads.
*  That one, yeah.
*  They're so much better.
*  I mean, you make way less errors.
*  First of all, they're curved.
*  Yeah.
*  The keys are curved so your fingers fit into them.
*  And also there's a lot of key travel.
*  Yeah.
*  So from 2.7 millimeters to, I think the maximum one is 2.2 millimeters and the minimum is
*  1.5.
*  1.5 is probably because as low as you really want to go.
*  Because any time you get around one, it's just not enough key travel.
*  In Apple, everything has to look beautiful.
*  Everything has to be designed.
*  It's all about the sleek design.
*  It's minimal stuff.
*  But it's horse shit.
*  Because you've made a tool that doesn't work as well.
*  It's flat keys.
*  They're not concave.
*  They have that beautiful C shape that Lenovo has.
*  So your fingers, you know which key you're hitting.
*  There's no errors.
*  You don't fuck up as much.
*  Yeah.
*  I did the old school, my mom made me take keyboarding in high school.
*  So I had to learn how to do other things.
*  So keyboard is important.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very important.
*  You should try a Think pad.
*  I'm telling you.
*  They're the shit.
*  Yeah, I will.
*  They're so much better.
*  And you get over the Windows thing.
*  Everybody's like, Windows sucks.
*  It doesn't suck anymore.
*  Windows 10 does not suck.
*  It's easy.
*  It doesn't fuck up.
*  It sucks when it has to update.
*  That shit takes a long time.
*  Right.
*  But that happens on the Mac too.
*  Yeah.
*  You just have it update at night or something.
*  But the type on it is a dream.
*  It's so much easier.
*  Well, especially if you're spending so much time writing on something like that.
*  If you're just like surfing the net.
*  It's like, I see like whatever.
*  I have this Think pad X1 carbon and it fucking weighs nothing.
*  It weighs like a couple of pounds.
*  Which is nice to take.
*  Like on the road I'm always like, my bookbag is like, oh my gosh.
*  Apple wants to make aluminum laptops.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that old beast that I have over there.
*  Old 17 inch one.
*  It's heavy and then you have that big old power strip.
*  Yeah, but that I could fuck somebody up with that if they're trying to mug me.
*  That's true.
*  If you have a bag with a 17 inch laptop in, that's like a bomb.
*  That is.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's actually the reason why I have that one.
*  Because the key travel was different back then.
*  The key travel is actually pretty good on that.
*  And the keys are a little curved.
*  But once they started trying to make them thinner and lighter, they fucked up.
*  That's what I have.
*  Because I have the air.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like my little fat fingers are like itty bitty.
*  It's hard.
*  And then change something recently where it's like I'm writing words and it's changing it
*  for me.
*  Auto correct?
*  Yeah, but to like totally wrong words.
*  Yeah, it's like, oh I think you meant this.
*  Yeah, I'm like, that's not.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's been weird.
*  Like there was some update that was weird lately.
*  In Microsoft Word?
*  I think so, yeah.
*  Unless I'm thinking about my phone.
*  It could be my phone.
*  It's the phone.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you meant to say.
*  But it's like the craziest words that no one's ever going to use.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean the classic ducking.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Who's ducking?
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  How often does that happen?
*  At some point they need to embrace that people are saying fucking.
*  Well, why don't they have like a way you can click on it and say learn?
*  Like maybe old people don't want you suggesting fucking.
*  Right.
*  But or, you know, hardcore Christians or something like that.
*  But if you're a person who says fuck all the time.
*  You should be able to auto correct to fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it says that.
*  Once you've used it enough, it should be like, all right, this is a standard word for their.
*  I wonder if Android does it the same way.
*  I don't know.
*  I wonder if Android corrects like that too.
*  My partner is an Android.
*  Yeah.
*  But I've never asked.
*  Lesbians are so funny with partner.
*  Why don't you just say my girl.
*  My girl.
*  My woman.
*  I don't know.
*  Why is it partner?
*  Partners always.
*  Are you guys in business?
*  This seems respectful.
*  Is that what it is?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, we're not married.
*  We're engaged.
*  But I think because people couldn't get married for so long, it was like they couldn't say
*  wife or husband.
*  So the word became partner.
*  It is weird, right?
*  Like wife and husband and all these words that just standard words that we just use
*  over and over again.
*  My wife.
*  My girl.
*  It's like your girlfriend for a long time.
*  It's your fiance for a long time.
*  It's wife.
*  When did bae come along?
*  When did bae?
*  When did bae come along?
*  It seems like it was real recent.
*  It was in like three or four years ago.
*  These fucking kids on Instagram.
*  They probably came up with it.
*  My bae.
*  Twitter kids.
*  Yeah.
*  My partner.
*  A friend of mine used it and he was talking about his wife.
*  It's like my partner and I, I'm your partner.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Your wife?
*  That lady that you're married to?
*  When did she become your fucking partner?
*  You guys go into business together?
*  People who are progressive, they try to use words that gay and lesbian people use.
*  The right words.
*  They try to use it almost as like they're an ally.
*  Like we're all one.
*  Yeah.
*  My partner and I.
*  Your partner.
*  Bitch, your wife.
*  That lady you're married to?
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  I find the word fiance weird.
*  It is weird.
*  So she is my fiance.
*  We've been engaged for over two years, but it's weird to be like, this is my fiance.
*  It almost seems like more pretentious.
*  It is a little bit, right?
*  It's like shit or get off the pot, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you doing?
*  I know.
*  People are like, what are you getting married?
*  I mean we are getting married, but we are like, just neither of us are planners.
*  You should be able to say it the week before the wedding.
*  Yeah.
*  My fiance and I.
*  The week before you can say it.
*  Other than that, stop saying it.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you come up with a better word for me.
*  Let me know.
*  One good thing about fiance is that it's gender neutral.
*  Right.
*  It's boy, girl, it's everybody.
*  Right.
*  It's just spelled differently, but no one really cares about that.
*  Where was I reading in some country they have a marriage contract that lasts a certain amount
*  of time.
*  Where the fuck was that?
*  I was like, wow, that's interesting.
*  There's like a five year contract with an ability to renew.
*  Oh, and so if it's not working out.
*  It just dissolves.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a lease on a car.
*  You just get that piece of shit back.
*  It's not bad for some people.
*  Great for some.
*  Anna Nicole Smith's husband would have loved that.
*  Yeah.
*  Just take a lease and try it out.
*  Yeah.
*  It'd save you a lot in divorce fees and all that.
*  Right.
*  Because this is, I don't know, it's weird.
*  In a case like the Anna Nicole Smith bit or the Anna Nicole Smith situation, that kind
*  of situation is weird when one person has the money and you can tell the other person
*  is only with them for the money.
*  Right.
*  And they're trying to talk them into signing a contract and then they'll eventually leave
*  them like I knew this lady.
*  She was really hot.
*  Her boyfriend was really not.
*  And we all knew what was coming.
*  Right.
*  And the guy had money.
*  And he wrote her into his.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They got married.
*  Yeah.
*  They got married and she took the house.
*  She took everything.
*  Oh, she left him.
*  Oh yeah.
*  We knew she was going to leave him.
*  How long did she stay in it?
*  She stayed in it a couple of years.
*  Just enough to get the chizzash.
*  Just enough.
*  That's brutal.
*  It was ugly for all involved.
*  Watching it on the outside.
*  We're like that poor bastard.
*  But you can't like say anything to your friend because then your friend's like, well, what's
*  wrong with me?
*  Why would she not want to be with me for me?
*  Well, I wasn't tight enough with him.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  He was just a casual friend.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  But it was like the writing was on the wall.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The moment I saw the two, I was like, oh, he's got money.
*  Oh, I see.
*  What's up?
*  And she was just.
*  She had hungry eyes.
*  That bitch was looking around.
*  Hungry eyes.
*  She was looking around.
*  She was looking around.
*  She was looking around.
*  She was like, what you got in that?
*  What you got in that wallet?
*  Yeah.
*  She was looking around for other dick too.
*  It was just one of those things.
*  Oh man.
*  They're always looking for the next.
*  But it is a possibility.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's like being a prostitute is illegal, but being a gold digger is fine.
*  Right.
*  Like you should go to jail for being a gold digger.
*  And what's the difference?
*  You know what I mean?
*  The line is not that far apart.
*  It's very close.
*  Yeah.
*  Like do you remember Donald Sterling?
*  Yeah.
*  He was like, oh, I'm going to go to jail.
*  I'm going to go to jail.
*  I'm going to go to jail.
*  Do you remember Donald Sterling?
*  The guy who owned the Clippers, the other really hot girlfriend.
*  She recorded him saying some racist shit.
*  That was a perfect example.
*  That girl was clearly a gold digger.
*  He was disgusting.
*  He was disgusting and she was hot.
*  And then he had to sell, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They made him sell the team.
*  I had a whole bit about it because it's really funny.
*  What he said was, he goes, I don't care if you fuck these guys, just don't take pictures
*  with them.
*  That's what he said?
*  See, everybody, it was a virtue signaling opportunity for everybody to make sure that
*  everyone knew that they were not racist and that they abhor racism, which is wonderful.
*  But what he said was pretty reasonable.
*  He said, I don't care if you fuck these guys, just don't take pictures with them.
*  Yeah.
*  Embarrassing him or something?
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But it's his girlfriend.
*  So imagine if he said it the other way.
*  I don't care if you take pictures with them, just don't fuck them.
*  That would be reasonable.
*  So he's given her a way better deal.
*  She's allowed to fuck them.
*  Yeah.
*  He's saying, I don't care if you fuck these guys.
*  Take all the selfies you want.
*  Just don't take pictures.
*  Imagine if he said it the other way.
*  Everybody would be like, well, that's reasonable.
*  If he said, just take pictures all day, but don't fuck them.
*  That would be like a standard thing that someone would ask of a spouse.
*  I mean, most spouses don't want you fucking other people.
*  Yeah, most.
*  Some of them do.
*  That's where it gets really weird, right?
*  The people that want you to fuck other people.
*  Like the open stuff?
*  They want you to take pictures.
*  Even worse.
*  Like cucks.
*  There's guys that want guys to fuck their girl.
*  Oh yeah, because there is like a, what, masochist or something like that?
*  No, they're cuckholds.
*  That's what it's called.
*  That's the real term.
*  Oh, I didn't know.
*  I just thought those were like pussies.
*  That is pussies.
*  But the origin of the term is cuckhold.
*  And the origin of the term is like a man who knows his wife is fucking other guys.
*  And either approves of it or likes the feeling of shame.
*  There's some men that like the feeling of shame and humiliation.
*  That is not me.
*  It takes all kinds to run this world.
*  How do we cry like a bitch?
*  But isn't it weird how it does take all types of people to run this world?
*  People have so, there's so many different kinds of people.
*  When it comes to like sex stuff, people are all over the spectrum.
*  All over the spectrum.
*  Furries.
*  You know, people like to dress up like mascots.
*  There's a lot of CEOs that like to hire dominatrix to tell them what to do and kick them in the balls.
*  It's the only person that will talk to them like that.
*  They like it.
*  They like guys to, or they like women to spit on them and stuff and piss on them and just treat them like shit.
*  I'll tell you this.
*  I don't want to be pissed on.
*  I stepped on a sea urchin once and somebody said, I'll piss on your foot.
*  I was like, I'm going to just be in pain for the next two hours.
*  I don't think that works.
*  That's what they say, but I don't know.
*  I stepped on one too.
*  They just poured vinegar on it.
*  I'm like, you don't have an ointment?
*  Why do you have to go straight to pissing on my foot?
*  Not much they can do.
*  I just pulled the things out.
*  I had to pull them out.
*  We were snorkeling and then we got near this reef and I wanted to put my feet down, catch a little break, and I just went right on to a sea urchin.
*  I attempted to surf in Hawaii and I couldn't even get my board past the break.
*  It kept pushing me back in and I got so tired of just like, I had no upper body strength.
*  I was like, fuck it.
*  I stood up and immediately stood on the sea urchin.
*  Yeah, those fuckers are rough.
*  They don't want to get eaten because they're delicious.
*  Have you ever had sea urchin sushi?
*  Never.
*  Oh, so good.
*  It looks like an orange tongue.
*  Oh, that's that orange.
*  I've never had it because it looks weird.
*  It does look weird but it's quite delicious.
*  And the texture is not?
*  It's a little mushy.
*  Okay.
*  But texture doesn't bother me.
*  Texture bothers me.
*  I can't eat certain foods.
*  Really?
*  Like what?
*  Like strawberries.
*  I know, it's so weird.
*  That's a crazy one.
*  The little seeds.
*  Oh really?
*  The pokey outy seeds?
*  I hate them.
*  Really?
*  Like the feeling of like biting.
*  What about kiwis?
*  Are you okay with that?
*  It would be the same because it's mushy and seeds.
*  Oh, you're a weirdo.
*  I'm a weirdo.
*  I think I'm just coming up with excuses not to eat fruit.
*  Like mentally I'm telling myself this.
*  Keep away from seeds.
*  Are you okay with oranges?
*  I like oranges, yeah.
*  What about when you find a seed?
*  Do you get mad?
*  It's different because it's not like that hard, I don't know, something about the hard
*  crunchy thing I don't like.
*  Same with like raspberries.
*  Those kind of seeds.
*  Raspberry seeds are a little odd.
*  Yeah.
*  They're a little odd.
*  I love the flavor of strawberries.
*  So what do you do about it?
*  You make someone peel your strawberries?
*  That's what you do when you become a super baller.
*  You're flying around in private jets getting your toes done.
*  Just have someone peel your strawberries.
*  I'm like, they're like, why?
*  Because I said so.
*  Do it bitch.
*  Peel the strawberries.
*  You don't have any texture thing?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Well good.
*  No, I don't have any problems with texture.
*  Yeah, I get it though.
*  I eat a lot of crazy shit though.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't have any problems with.
*  You're a very healthy guy.
*  I'm pretty healthy.
*  Good for you.
*  Thank you.
*  Good for you.
*  Do you have any aspirations to be healthy?
*  Do you want to one day?
*  I mean, I've been trying to be better.
*  I lost 40 pounds.
*  That's awesome.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  I mean, it's more like 32 now.
*  That's good enough.
*  But you know, it's a start.
*  It is a good start.
*  It always fluctuates.
*  But I think once I got with my fiance, she's very skinny.
*  Your partner?
*  Yeah, my partner.
*  She's very skinny and she comes from a healthy family.
*  Does she ever like, bitch, you're crushing me?
*  Well, she's.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  She just was like, you know, we were like in love and it was new.
*  We were eating like 10 course meals all the time.
*  Woo.
*  That's nice.
*  You know, you're just like, then you're just like.
*  Living the high life together.
*  Watching Netflix.
*  Do you drink?
*  Yeah, I drink.
*  So you drink wine.
*  Yeah, I drink wine.
*  Old fashioned is my drink.
*  Good times.
*  Getting a little lit with the one you love.
*  But we both just like, we got engaged and saw our engagement photos and we were like,
*  oh shit.
*  Oh shit.
*  Like, there's no joy in looking at our engagement photos.
*  We're both like horrified.
*  So it like was the catalyst.
*  We did that whole 30 thing.
*  You know what that is?
*  What's that?
*  It's like for 30 days, it's an elimination diet.
*  It's like no sugar, no dairy, no gluten, soy, all that stuff.
*  No alcohol.
*  And it really like made me for the first time start reading labels.
*  I started realizing like what all the chemicals were in foods.
*  And it's basically eating whole foods, like meat and vegetables basically for a month.
*  And how'd it go?
*  I lost 20 pounds the first round.
*  That's amazing.
*  Kept it off and then did another round like six months later, lost another like 18, 20.
*  And I kept it off for a while and it's like over the holidays, like seven pounds or so
*  creep back in.
*  Yeah, the holiday creep.
*  Yeah, but at least I'm like, we're trying to go hiking together because I just come
*  from a family.
*  I come from North Carolina.
*  We love fried food.
*  My family's were big folks.
*  And I just never really learned that nutrition thing.
*  We didn't have a lot of money.
*  And when you're poor, all the, you know, the worst foods for you are like a dollar.
*  Yeah, it's not amazing that poor people are fat in this country.
*  Yeah, this is the only time in history where poor people are overweight.
*  In the past, it was, I mean, look at photos from like the 1920s when people were poor.
*  Yeah, that's sunken cheekbones.
*  Try not to starve to death.
*  They just needed food.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, it's like when you don't have a lot of money, you do tend to go to like
*  the fast food places, the food that's not good for you.
*  So I'm almost like having to retrain myself and my brain as an adult.
*  And it seems like backwards.
*  You can eat pretty good at fast food if you if you're smart.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you like you can get like three egg McMuffins and just take away the bread and
*  just eat the ham and the egg.
*  That is actually good.
*  It's not bad.
*  It's actually good for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a bullshit egg.
*  It's really the yellow of the yolk looks like your legal pad.
*  You know, I mean, yellow like I buy these organic eggs.
*  I used to have chickens with the coyotes killed them all.
*  Oh, that's a bummer.
*  It's cunts.
*  Yeah.
*  Cunty coyotes.
*  But my brother has chickens and same thing.
*  My my yolks used to look like orange.
*  Yeah.
*  I get them from the chickens that I raised because I'd let them roam around.
*  But that's also how they got whacked.
*  Gosh.
*  We lost a bunch of them that way.
*  And then we lost more of them because they broke into the chicken coop and killed them
*  all.
*  But I buy them now from this organic company that lets their chickens free range and their
*  dark, dark, healthy yolks.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't get that from McDonald's, unfortunately.
*  No.
*  But you still get eggs, which are good for you, and ham, which is not bad for you.
*  Yeah.
*  You can you can be pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  I think where I get messed up is the road.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard for me to like really maintain that.
*  I need structure.
*  I need like, oh, I don't you know, every day we're going to hike.
*  We're going to do this.
*  We're going to eat at home.
*  Yeah.
*  As soon as I start on the road, it's like, oh, we're you know, well, we got to take
*  this delicacy from, I don't know, Detroit.
*  Right.
*  Well, I have to actually after shows is a real problem for everybody because you're
*  tired.
*  Yeah.
*  When you're tired, you make the worst food choices.
*  For sure.
*  You're like, fucking feed me cake.
*  Give me cake.
*  Cake for breakfast.
*  Yeah.
*  You want fries, poutine.
*  You ever been to Montreal?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Poutine.
*  That's good.
*  That's good.
*  It's really good.
*  The gravy.
*  Montreal has some good food.
*  They have some good food.
*  One of my favorite restaurants ever is in Montreal.
*  It's called Joe Beef.
*  I've heard I've never I've never been.
*  All the comics love that place.
*  God damn.
*  It's good.
*  And the guys Fred and David have been in here before.
*  They've been on the podcast before.
*  They're great.
*  I was introduced to them by Bourdain.
*  It's a good steakhouse, right?
*  They have everything.
*  OK.
*  It's a French restaurant.
*  Oh, gotcha.
*  Spectacular food.
*  Yeah.
*  It's first time I ever ate horse.
*  Oh, I had a horse in Switzerland by accident.
*  By accident?
*  It was bovine.
*  It was gnarly.
*  What do you think it was?
*  I can't imagine it being that texture, man.
*  It tasted like a raw hamburger fatty.
*  Oh, well, it was probably tartar.
*  It was probably yeah.
*  But I didn't order that.
*  I ordered a hamburger.
*  So you thought you were getting a hamburger and they gave you raw horse meat?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  It was like, listen, bitch, I'll tell you what to eat.
*  I'm getting some horse.
*  I bit down on it.
*  And I was like, ooh, like my dog in the car.
*  It is interesting what we choose to eat and what we choose not to eat.
*  I went down a homesteading rabbit hole last night.
*  For whatever reason, you know, sometimes I go on YouTube rabbit holes and last night
*  I spent an hour watching videos of people who raise all of their own food and they homestead.
*  And this one guy was talking about rabbits and he's raised his rabbits and he has these
*  rabbits in hutches, these hutches and then they keep them and eat them.
*  And he was like, two rabbits will give you 600 pounds of meat a year.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Two rabbits.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they fuck so much.
*  Wow.
*  And they make so many rabbit babies and they keep doing it.
*  And then you mix them up and make them, fuck them and they all fuck each other and they
*  make more rabbits and then you keep feeding those rabbits.
*  And the other thing that he was saying was the rabbit poop is like the best fertilizer
*  on earth.
*  It's amazing fertilizer.
*  Yeah.
*  And also the birds will actively peck at the rabbit poop and they will turn the rabbit
*  poop.
*  They actually turn the soil for you.
*  They fold it into the soil for you.
*  Man.
*  Crazy.
*  These people living off the land, right?
*  Yeah, well this guy was living off the land.
*  He seemed a little odd.
*  Usually.
*  They always are.
*  They're a little, when they're off the grid and.
*  He was homeschooling his children, you know, the whole deal.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Jesus is coming back and when he does, we're going to give him rabbit meat.
*  Everybody's got a bunker.
*  Jesus is coming back.
*  Don't listen to those people at school.
*  They don't know shit.
*  I know those little kids.
*  They like try to like, you know, intertwine with other kids at some point.
*  And you're just like, oh poor kids.
*  You were homeschooled, right?
*  That's a rough spot for kids.
*  If they've been homeschooled and then one day they get out in the real world.
*  Well, you just need to socialize them.
*  I mean, listen, if you want to homeschool, good for you.
*  I understand some people, you know, you end up getting a much better education if you're
*  a good homeschool teacher, but socialize your kids.
*  That will help them.
*  I knew this one kid that was socialized and his dad, he's taken to jujitsu and he was
*  pretty talented, like pretty talented jujitsu kid.
*  But he was just so socially awkward for someone his age.
*  Yeah.
*  Whereas other kids like, I want to say like 16, 17 at the time, other 16, 17 year old
*  kids who would come to class, they would be like kids.
*  They'd be having a good time trying to learn like, oh, this is cool.
*  But they were used to being around people.
*  Right.
*  Like the whole wild world.
*  Yeah.
*  Out here in the world in his jujitsu class.
*  And he seemed like a little shell shocked to be around large groups of people.
*  Whereas kids that go to school, you're used to being around large groups of people.
*  Right.
*  There's a very valuable socializing aspect to school.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, most people don't even learn anything in college.
*  They just learn how to like be a cool person to hang out with.
*  Right.
*  Well, they learn some weird stuff.
*  Not everybody.
*  Well, they do learn, but some people also learn how to push buttons.
*  Yeah.
*  They learn how to get people to like you.
*  Right.
*  They learn how to get people to think you're virtuous.
*  Right.
*  You know, how to be for the right causes and how to shame people that are for the wrong
*  causes and how to try to, you know, there's a lot of that going on in college too.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's also part of being a young person, right?
*  Right.
*  You're young, you have these ideals and you're trying to enforce them on other people.
*  Or you think you know more than everybody else.
*  It's hilarious.
*  It's adorable to watch.
*  When I go to college shows now, I'm like, oh, you guys are so young.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't believe it.
*  You still do college shows?
*  Like here and there.
*  It's once in a blue moon.
*  They're hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you know, those kids just like, they don't know how to take things like, they don't
*  get the joke sometimes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They don't know how to joke around.
*  Everything's literal.
*  Yeah, very literal.
*  Where you're like, hey, that was me sarcastic.
*  You know?
*  You're not allowed to.
*  Yeah.
*  You shouldn't do that.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not 80% people.
*  They're not 100% people.
*  I've been schooled sometimes.
*  Really?
*  You shouldn't say that.
*  Come on.
*  The kids in the crowd tell you or afterwards?
*  It was a while ago, but you know, you're just like, all right, I'm not getting paid
*  enough.
*  I had a kid come up to me once and tell me that something was anti-semitic.
*  And this was the, it was like, someone said, do you know any joke?
*  It was like one of those fun, it was like a little auditorium, not a big crowd.
*  This was way back in the day.
*  And someone said, do you know any joke jokes?
*  Any good jokes?
*  I said, okay, I go into one, two Jews walk into a bar.
*  They buy it.
*  That's it.
*  And sick guy comes up to me and goes, that joke is very anti-semitic.
*  I go, why?
*  Because Jewish people are good at business.
*  They're successful.
*  That's not anti-semitic.
*  That's pro-Jewish.
*  That means they're good at buying stuff.
*  They're good at running businesses.
*  That may be a stereotype, but it's a positive stereotype.
*  It's a successful stereotype.
*  It's like black guys with big dicks.
*  Right?
*  Is that racist?
*  Who doesn't want you to say that?
*  That's not racist.
*  It may be stereotypical.
*  It's a stereotype, but it's a positive stereotype.
*  But no one's been like, yo, Joe, don't say I have a big dick.
*  Italian grandmas are good cooks.
*  Oh my God, you're racist.
*  Like, no, that's usually a fact.
*  Yeah, because there's usually more people where that is true than not.
*  It's a stereotype, but it's a positive stereotype.
*  There's a difference between something that's discriminatory, like it's mean and nasty.
*  And something that's just fun.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  College kids don't get that yet.
*  No.
*  They're at 80%.
*  And so I had this conversation with the kid.
*  He felt like, boy, he was going to tell me.
*  He came up to me to let me know.
*  This is, again, this is the 90s, early 90s.
*  And I was like, how is that possibly anti-Semitic?
*  And he didn't have an answer.
*  He was baffled.
*  He thought he could just say it.
*  And then I'd be like, oh my God, I'm sorry.
*  I didn't know I offended you.
*  You did.
*  And then he was going to leave.
*  And that's it.
*  I'm fucking you.
*  I showed him.
*  I'm like, think about what the joke is.
*  I'm saying they buy the bar.
*  How is that bad in any way?
*  But that's half of college shows.
*  You're explaining your jokes.
*  I'm taking up time just explaining the joke I just told.
*  But that one in particular is so ridiculous because there's nothing negative about it
*  at all.
*  It's the simplest joke of all time.
*  Two Jews walking in a bar, they buy it.
*  It's not even that funny.
*  But I don't know any jokes.
*  I don't know any joke jokes either.
*  You know, that's the worst.
*  Tell me a joke.
*  Get out of here.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me what you talk about.
*  Oh, God.
*  I talk about life.
*  I've had fucking comedian, like older comedians in particular, say that.
*  So what kind of shit do you talk about on stage?
*  Well, I talk about the hierarchies and how we can dismantle them and separate people.
*  What?
*  I don't know what to talk about.
*  I talk about life.
*  Yeah.
*  Or you will meet somebody for five minutes and like, you can talk about me if you want.
*  What do I?
*  I don't know you.
*  Oh, they say that?
*  Yeah.
*  What would I possibly talk about?
*  That's what you should say.
*  People that think I'm going to talk about them on stage.
*  Hey, fuck face.
*  Yeah.
*  You ain't interesting.
*  I'm like, I'm minding my own crazy life, my own silly family.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm good.
*  I have no time to be fucking with you and your nonsense.
*  Your nonsense.
*  Yeah, I came up at the store.
*  That's where I first learned stand up.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What year did you start?
*  2007.
*  Wow.
*  That's the year I left.
*  I know.
*  That was the whole controversy.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I wasn't there that night, but it was all the talk, obviously.
*  Yeah, I started 2007 in the Belly Room.
*  That was when no one was coming to shows.
*  It was empty there.
*  They were giving me like 130 spots.
*  That was the one thing that I felt bad about.
*  I felt like, damn, what if that place goes under after I bolted and talk shit about them?
*  What if they...
*  Because it hit them.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just a different time.
*  Now every show's sold out.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Yeah, but back then I was performing four drunk dudes.
*  Well, 2014 is when it all turned back around.
*  It did make it turn back around, just like all you guys coming back and doing sets all
*  the time.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and then talking about it.
*  Talking about coming back.
*  I think podcasts helped.
*  When I started back again, it was pretty good.
*  It wasn't as good as it is now.
*  Now it's amazing.
*  Now it's great.
*  It's insane how it is now.
*  But creatively, it was really good back then.
*  I saw Roast Battle for the first time, and I remember being there and going, wow, these
*  people are fucking creative.
*  This is a fun show.
*  I came back because, well, first of all, because Adam, Adam Egan, and because Tommy got fired,
*  the dipshit that was running it.
*  But also because Ari was doing his comedy special there.
*  Right, right.
*  And I love Ari to death.
*  And there was no way I was going to miss that.
*  I was like, I can't miss it.
*  He's one of my best friends.
*  I was friends with him when he was a doorman at the store.
*  Now here he is doing his Comedy Central special there.
*  I'm like, I have to come back.
*  I went there the night before, which was a Tuesday.
*  He was filming on a Wednesday.
*  I came there the night before, and I saw Roast Battle.
*  And then I hung out.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  I was like, this just feels crazy.
*  It feels like a different place.
*  Like a whole different energy.
*  And Adam was like, come on, man, come back.
*  That was 2014?
*  Man, that was a long time.
*  Long time ago.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, between the-
*  Seven years I was gone.
*  Yeah, I was gone for seven years.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I saw Ari Set.
*  And then I sat down with Pauly.
*  Made nice nights with Pauly.
*  We became buddies again.
*  And then I said, fuck it, I'm back.
*  And then when I came back, Joey came back, I think, a little bit before me.
*  I think Joey was back like maybe a month before I was, which helped me as well.
*  And then Duncan came back a little bit after that.
*  And then Adam, because everybody loves Adam, he opened the door to a bunch of comics that
*  never worked the store before.
*  They thought it was dark.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people thought it was like a gross place.
*  Well, it had a weird energy.
*  Yeah.
*  There was, like you would walk down the hall and you could feel that sort of heaviness.
*  And you're like, this is a comedy place.
*  Like, this is weird that it feels so heavy.
*  Well, that place has gone through weird peaks and valleys.
*  When I went there in 94, I first came here from Boston, or from New York, actually.
*  I went to Boston, New York.
*  But when I was in Boston, it was Mecca.
*  We would talk about it like, dude, that's where Kinnison came from.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Kinnison was at the store, Richard Pryor.
*  Bill Hicks was a doorman.
*  I mean, we would talk about it with like hushed tones.
*  It was like the Mecca.
*  It was Mecca.
*  But then when I came here in 94, it was dog shit.
*  Really?
*  Oh, it was terrible.
*  It was terrible.
*  There were a bunch of bodaks.
*  See, what happened was Kinnison died in like 92.
*  And when he died, there was a vacuum.
*  There was a void.
*  And he had already left the store.
*  He left the store, I think, like a year or two before that.
*  He had a falling out with Mitzi.
*  He was fucking crazy.
*  Right.
*  Kinnison was legitimately crazy.
*  And there was a wave when he was there where a bunch of people would come to see him and
*  some of the other guys like Rick Dookman and some, you know, there was Martin Lawrence
*  was there.
*  And then, well, actually, Martin Lawrence was there during the time during 94 when I
*  was there.
*  Yeah.
*  Made me be like 95 or 96.
*  But when I came back, most of the nights he would be there, like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
*  Thursday, it was like terrible.
*  Half filled rooms, terrible acts.
*  People that should have quit comedy years ago, but they were only doing the store.
*  They were getting spots.
*  They were getting spots, but they weren't working.
*  They weren't like working comics.
*  And they were working probably the same material that was happening a lot even when I started.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  They were working the same material forever for years and years and years.
*  And that that was fucking gross.
*  It was just it was weird to see.
*  Like, I remember the first night I came there, I sat in the back of the room to watch a show.
*  I was out here for a pilot with me and Jim Brewer.
*  We're out here filming a pilot.
*  We both lived on the East Coast.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, wow, this is the store.
*  This is weird.
*  Right.
*  Acts are terrible.
*  No one knows good.
*  There was no one good.
*  It wasn't like, you know, Dom Marrero was there.
*  I mean, I'm sure he was there occasionally, but it wasn't like it is tonight where any
*  night you go there, you'll see Ron White, Chris D'Alea, Nick Swartz and Whitney Cummings,
*  fucking Anthony Jesselny.
*  It's like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  Oh, it's just killer after killer after killer after killer.
*  It's like, holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  When I started it, it wasn't like Tony was a door guy.
*  He was a door guy then.
*  And I'm trying to get D'Alea was like just starting to do like the O.R.
*  And, you know, yeah, it was an interesting time.
*  Like Whitney was doing a lot of spots in O.R.
*  And, you know, it was very clickish.
*  Like everybody kind of knew each other.
*  And I just like started in the belly room and worked my way down.
*  And it was cool, though, because it made me it made you better.
*  Because, you know, there was like never I wasn't I rarely did a show with more than
*  like 10 people in the audience, at least downstairs.
*  But I remember late night spots are weird.
*  Those late night.
*  Yeah, they're weird.
*  And they didn't care.
*  Tommy didn't care if people were on TV.
*  Like I remember Jordan Peele had just finished Mad TV.
*  He they put him up on it was like that bringer not bringer show was an open mic.
*  They let him do like three minutes on this open mic.
*  He wasn't what he is now as far as like he had this huge hit movie now.
*  He's this massive director.
*  But he was been on Mad TV for seven years.
*  He went like three and a half minutes.
*  Tommy comes storming out.
*  Get the fuck off the stage.
*  You're like, what's happening?
*  It was like the Wild Wild West.
*  And so I just kind of like kept to myself and just kept doing jokes.
*  Well, Tommy should have never been in a position ever to tell anyone what to do.
*  And they let him do that because he was basically miss his caretaker.
*  And right, you know, along the way he alienated a lot of people.
*  It became a real mess.
*  Yeah, a lot of people.
*  But I had you know, I was lucky because early on like guys started seeing me
*  perform in the Belly Room and they were the one because you know, it's hard to get his ear.
*  You had to like get his ear to like let you showcase.
*  But like I remember Brett Ernst saw me at a show and he's like, you got to you got to showcase.
*  I can't get Tommy's attention.
*  You know, so it was like dudes would like, you know, he he would see Tommy like you got to let her showcase.
*  You got to let her showcase.
*  I was wondering if maybe he was like Jack Nicholson, The Shining, like in the Overlook Hotel.
*  Yeah, the place like took over him.
*  It might have like maybe he was just vulnerable and dumb enough so that the ghost could get in his head.
*  Yeah, because that place is that place is definitely weird.
*  Yeah, it's but it's real positive now.
*  It's a different feel.
*  That darkness isn't isn't there anymore.
*  Yeah, it's very supportive.
*  I showcased for Midsea.
*  I did the video though.
*  She wasn't there.
*  She had just passed Justin Martindale and then I showcased.
*  Justin Martindale was the last person she passed.
*  The last one and then I and then she passed.
*  She did pass me as a non-paid regular first.
*  Me too.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  So I got to do the Belly Room on Friday nights.
*  And then I was a non-paid regular for like six months and then then I got passed.
*  Yeah, my story is real similar.
*  Non-paid regular for like I think four or five months.
*  I was going on every night late late late at night.
*  I was going on after the show was over.
*  Just you know, just and I get it.
*  I mean, I was only I got passed three years in the stand-up.
*  So I wasn't complaining.
*  But you know, she was like she needs to keep working.
*  Sure.
*  I'm not going to make her a paid regular yet.
*  So it made me, you know, have to work.
*  Yeah.
*  Work for it, which I appreciate now.
*  Well, also, it's like you get used to the club.
*  You get used to just being like to me is just being there was so weird.
*  But I was six years in a comedy when I came to LA.
*  And I remember the day I became a paid regular was like.
*  I couldn't sleep.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  I was staying in the Oakwood Gardens Apartments.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Furnished Apartments.
*  Oh, the furnished ones.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Everybody Disney.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was laying in bed going, holy fuck.
*  I'm a paid regular at the store.
*  I'm a real comedian now.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all I could think of.
*  I was like, I'm a real comedian.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Like I'm a professional.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a big deal.
*  Oh my God.
*  For me, it was huge.
*  And it was like because I started an improv and sketch at the groundlings.
*  Oh, did you?
*  Yeah.
*  So I had like even though I was newer to stand up, I had had that stage experience
*  for a couple years before I started stand up, which I felt helped me just get
*  in the rhythm of stand up right away.
*  And so I just kind of hit the ground running.
*  And to me, one of my biggest accomplishments is being a paid regular.
*  And that I got it before I was on TV.
*  Because sometimes I feel like that does help when you're like on TV.
*  They're like, oh, well, they're funny.
*  They're on TV.
*  And they sometimes get passed.
*  And so it made me feel like a real comic to get past and not have any TV credits.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm sure.
*  I mean, having that any kind of performance experience is going to like at least
*  give you this comfortable feeling of performing and talking in front of people.
*  Some people it's so weird talking in front of people.
*  It's just that's the thing.
*  That's one of the most terrifying things that some people can do.
*  Yeah, like before death.
*  People were afraid of it.
*  I really I'd rather do a set in the belly or.
*  Yeah, just get a mic.
*  Do you really want to be that scared?
*  What did you start doing the road?
*  Pretty quick to 2010.
*  I did last comic standing.
*  Oh, who was on that?
*  That's that was Felipe as far as the one.
*  Hey, Tommy John again.
*  Oh, nice.
*  I love Felipe.
*  Yeah, Nikki Glaser.
*  Oh, she was on that.
*  She's on that season.
*  Yeah.
*  Damn, it's a good season.
*  It's a good season.
*  And it had been like gone away and come back.
*  So it was kind of an experience.
*  The host, Craig Robinson.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I did that and I started the road after that.
*  But like shit gigs, you know, forgot.
*  Craig was the host of it.
*  I just remember when Jay was the host of it.
*  Yeah, it was it had been on and it was like more of a reality
*  show with stand up.
*  And then when they brought it back, it was like just stand up.
*  No one was like living in a house together.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, there were no like challenges.
*  It was just stand up.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You got lucky.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Because I was like, I don't want to live in a house with a bunch of stand ups.
*  So we just got to do stand up.
*  And then I started touring after that.
*  And then 2011, I got Chelsea lately and then I started basically
*  I've been touring ever since.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  Mm hmm.
*  That's amazing.
*  That's a good little origin story.
*  Yeah, like, well, Bill Burr used to he's always been so nice to me
*  and he'd always be like, why are you never at the store?
*  I'm like, I'm I'm touring.
*  I promise you, I'm doing stand up.
*  I just started touring like and wasn't going in as much for a little bit.
*  That's great, though.
*  But he's always like, you need to stop acting and just to stand up.
*  I'm like, I get it.
*  But I do.
*  It's a compliment.
*  I do like acting.
*  When he says that, it's a compliment.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  He just he just thinks you're really funny.
*  That's that's high praise.
*  Yeah, he's always been so good to me.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He's a really good guy.
*  The best.
*  I just didn't think that he would be into my comedy, you know, I
*  He loves comedy period.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And he loves just he loves the art form and he respects people that work hard at it
*  and that are good at it.
*  He's so down to earth like still.
*  Yeah.
*  And all the success that he's had, I've known him forever.
*  He's never changed.
*  Such as yeah, he's the same guy.
*  I love him.
*  And he's so humble.
*  Like if you tell him that he's doing well, it's like a lot of people are doing well.
*  Yeah, he's always got to he's in shit on himself.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's why he's so funny.
*  I mean, this is also a unique time in that comics are putting out all these
*  specials and the specials are better with each time.
*  Like I think paper tiger was one of his best specials ever.
*  Yeah, maybe his best.
*  It was really sharp and it's hard to top yourself at his level.
*  You know, it is.
*  Yeah, but that's the thing about the store.
*  That's so wonderful.
*  I hate to use that word because it makes me sound fake wonderful wonderful.
*  It's so amazing that there's so many people doing that like, you know,
*  and it's cool to be able to sit down and talk to the different people that are
*  doing it in, you know, different ways like yeah, like Bill doesn't put himself
*  on any kind of a cycle.
*  He just decides when it's time to do a special.
*  Yeah, it's like I don't I don't want to ruin it.
*  Like whenever I want to do it, then I'll do a special.
*  Right.
*  But Jessel neck puts himself on a cycle and it's an interesting cycle.
*  Does he one year all town all in town crafting the material one year clubs.
*  Okay, one year theaters film a special.
*  I did not know that Jessel neck is one of the hardest workers and one of the
*  most clever writers in the business.
*  Yeah, he's very sharp.
*  Very clever.
*  And his jokes are one of those jokes where you hear it and you go,
*  yeah, like this is like a pause.
*  We like God, that's a good point because you don't see it coming to which is a
*  real talent.
*  Yes.
*  And he goes dark and there's you know, only so many people that can get away
*  with that.
*  Oh, he can get away with where you're like, who you did that.
*  Yeah, but he's confident and you know, it's also just it's so well done.
*  Yeah, it's like if you're going to drive fast, you better be really good
*  at driving.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, like if you're gonna do dark comedy, you better be really good.
*  You gotta be really good jokes and you gotta go all in.
*  Yeah, can't just dip a toe in it.
*  Dippin' in the dark.
*  He's fucking cliff diving.
*  He makes me laugh though.
*  Like there was a like a LA Times.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  They were interviewing like Sebastian and a Scalco and they came to the store
*  to interview him and they said that that Jessel Nick came in the room where he
*  was being interviewed and just sat and stared at him to purposely make
*  him uncomfortable.
*  I thought that was so funny.
*  It sounds like Jessel Nick.
*  And then he finally got to Sebastian and he's like, okay, can you get out of here?
*  He's another guy.
*  Sebastian is.
*  It's hugely successful, but really humble.
*  Never changed at all.
*  Yeah, just just happy and grateful.
*  And yeah, yeah.
*  Well, that's the cool thing about comedy right now.
*  I mean, you've seen so many different iterations of it, but like
*  dudes are selling out arenas.
*  I mean you too.
*  It's like every it's the comedy is like as big as rock guys, you know, like it
*  used to be the opposite was always the the rock guys were like here in the
*  comics wanted to be them and now they look all these, you know, guys are like
*  killing it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the difference is the rock guys have a fucking band and they have to
*  get along with the band and then like I bring different opening acts all the time.
*  I don't want anybody get annoying.
*  Yeah, I mix it up.
*  Yeah.
*  And we don't have to bring shit with us.
*  I have to bring drums.
*  Isn't that the beauty of it?
*  I'm plug in an amp.
*  Yeah, feedback.
*  You don't do a tour bus, right?
*  No, what my Bert Kreischer that fucking dipshit.
*  He's got his name on the side of it.
*  I love him to death.
*  He's one of my best friends.
*  What the fuck Bert?
*  I love Bert, but that is what the fuck is big picture of his face over his
*  bus.
*  He is me.
*  Of course.
*  He and Joe Coy always mess with each other like Joe's all showing his plane
*  and Bert showing his tour bus.
*  What does Joe Coy have a plane with his face on it?
*  Not with his face on it.
*  Just there.
*  They're like showing off their like loads of transportation.
*  Yeah, and I'm all like I get upgraded on American this weekend.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  Look at that bus.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at those beautiful boobs.
*  Body shot World Tour.
*  Look, he's got his fucking podcast.
*  That's just you're just begging to get stalked.
*  Yeah, but I mean that is it is a roll in advertisement.
*  I mean, I guess it's also annoying.
*  All of us all of his friends are like, what are you doing man?
*  But he's but he's been that guy.
*  Yes forever where he's just like hey, I'm going to bar after the show.
*  Let's go.
*  Like I don't think he cares like he's drunk.
*  Yeah, it's why would he care?
*  He's drunk and in college what he was like the dude the party guy.
*  He was the inspiration for that movie with Ryan Reynolds and Wilder and Wilder.
*  Yeah, was the inspiration.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Like is that fucking nuts?
*  That's how so a guy like the guy like where God I love him to death.
*  He would have a bus with of course he would of course he would but yeah, he's so silly.
*  But it works.
*  It's also he's so grateful because he had this travel Channel show.
*  Yeah, and all of us Bert was out there traveling and he's he's doing these shows.
*  He's gone for months and months at a time and all of us like Bill talked to him about it.
*  I talked to him about him like I remember I called him once and he was drunk on a motorcycle in Vietnam.
*  He told me that story.
*  He said you were big reason why he was like I got to I got to stop doing this and get back to stand up.
*  Yeah, I'm like dude.
*  You're a great comic.
*  You're a funny guy and you're you that'll go away and you'll be you'll be at the at the beck and call of these people in the
*  Travel Channel who want to censor you.
*  I mean they everything has to be like squeaky clean down the middle like I was friends of Bourdain and he had real problems with the
*  Travel Channel.
*  Yeah, you know they at the time.
*  I think they were owned by very religious people and I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, there was a lot of weird shit.
*  So they wanted him.
*  He couldn't talk about no things.
*  Yeah, he's a parts of fucking Savage.
*  He's a drunk Savage and he's out there, you know, I mean he enjoyed being employed on television.
*  Right was all good.
*  It was not what a bad thing was a great job.
*  I'm sure he loved the job, but I equated it.
*  I had experience doing fear factor.
*  So for me was like kind of the same thing, but at least fear factor was in town.
*  Yeah, and I could do the store at night, but I was telling him like listen man.
*  You won't be happy unless you have a career as a stand-up.
*  You'll always going to wonder you always going to see these guys, but you going to drive by the improv see these guys headline.
*  And you could be me.
*  I could be up there having a great time.
*  Yeah, look and look at the level.
*  He's at now.
*  That wouldn't happen.
*  He's crushing it.
*  He's crushing selling out fucking theaters everywhere everywhere.
*  Yeah, it I mean it's a direct result of him deciding to take that chance and that's a hard chance to take when you have a family.
*  I'll tell you that's one of the hardest things in this business is betting on yourself.
*  Yeah, it's so hard to get stability in this business.
*  So when you get a taste of it, you're like, oh I can't I don't I don't want to mess this up.
*  Yeah, but you don't realize that the risk is greater.
*  It you might fail but the risk is if it works it works like five times.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But that's that's a hard leap for a lot of people to take it is it's one of the reasons why I have so many jobs.
*  I don't want I don't want anybody to have any power over me.
*  Yeah, like I want I just I have a good philosophy on how I do my thing.
*  You know, I want to just I just want to do my best and have fun and the more people that are in your ear talking you about stuff and telling you what to do and what not to do and what you get away with and not get away with the more you're fucked.
*  Well, yeah, it's like you're you're never going to find your best voice.
*  You're just not going to because you're not being you at the end.
*  Yeah, you're compromising yourself for some company or you're compromising yourself for because you want to get hired for the next job.
*  Right.
*  This job is over.
*  But when you don't have a job and you just you're just you're just an artist.
*  Right.
*  Then you just get to create the best comedy you can create and the podcast thing just sort of like became like a support.
*  But it started off just for fun.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it became like a support mechanism and then it became this what it is now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just bizarre.
*  Which how long ago was it that it started?
*  Ten years.
*  Ten years.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was like at the the forefront of it.
*  Yeah, I started after I got booted from the store.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I started two years later.
*  You're like fine.
*  Find your own outlet.
*  Well, was that I was also depressed.
*  I just come back from Colorado was trying to move to Colorado.
*  But then my wife got pregnant when we were in the mountains and we got a house in the mountains like 8500 feet above sea level like way up like to live.
*  I wanted to live up there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It just subs tired of like this for me is like big crowds like all these big crowds and what would be like the perfect antidote to big crowds.
*  No one.
*  Right.
*  Just peace.
*  So that was like so when you are when a woman gets pregnant at very high altitude, it's actually kind of dangerous.
*  Oh really?
*  Especially if you're not acclimated.
*  Denver, which is only 5500 feet has very high number of premature births.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, because of that because of the altitude.
*  Yeah, it's just you know, it's no fucking air up there.
*  People aren't supposed to live up there probably baby needs oxygen.
*  So we move back when we move back.
*  I was like, all right.
*  I was like, I got to do something different.
*  So me and Red Band started doing just with a laptop answering questions.
*  Yeah, just like doing a live stream and answering questions.
*  Yeah, knuckleheads like 200 people.
*  Yeah, you know, and that's how it started.
*  You put it up on your own website.
*  Put it up on you stream at first.
*  Okay.
*  And then after a few months, we decided to start uploading it to iTunes as an audio version of it.
*  Yeah, and then it became what it is now.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's very strange.
*  Yeah, but that also helps me to not have a job.
*  Right.
*  You know, it's like I don't have to think well now you are not making decisions out of fear.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, and that's where people really get bitten the ass.
*  Yes, everyone's making decisions out of fear, but it's hard.
*  It's hard to take that fucking leap.
*  You know, it's hard.
*  It's dangerous.
*  It's a dangerous leap to bet on yourself.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  When did you first like realize like fully you're making a living doing stand-up?
*  When did you go like I don't need anything else?
*  I mean, I like I said, I started touring in 2010, but it was like to you know, small clubs and...
*  Weed middling.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I never, I went straight from the store to headlining.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it was a weird journey.
*  That's crazy.
*  I wish I had middled.
*  How the fuck did you do that?
*  Last Comic Standing and Chelsea, they came back to back.
*  Yeah.
*  And so because I had been at the store for three years just honing my material and I was doing sets all the time.
*  I was doing shows constantly around town.
*  Last Comic Standing launched a lot of people, right?
*  Eliza.
*  Yeah.
*  Who else?
*  Felipe, you.
*  Was Alonzo?
*  Did Alonzo get launched from Last Comic Standing?
*  Yeah.
*  He's done so many things.
*  I think Kathleen Madigan and they did it early on.
*  Ralphie for sure.
*  Ralphie, yeah, and Gary Goldman.
*  It was early on.
*  But Gary Goldman was on that fucking...
*  Yeah, he'd already been doing...
*  ...Dane Cook thing.
*  That weird HBO thing that they did together.
*  I forgot about that.
*  Yeah, everybody did.
*  Yeah, and so I wish I had middled because I would have like, still this day I'm like, God, I'm so curious how other people do their shows, you know?
*  But I just sort of went from zero to 60, like doing the store for three years.
*  That's crazy.
*  To like headlining.
*  And so I just kind of...
*  How much time did you have?
*  Oh my God, I probably, really 30 minutes.
*  And you're headlining?
*  I was headlining, but I did a lot, because of my improv background with Groundlings, I did a lot of crowd work.
*  Oh, well that's good.
*  But good for you for taking that chance.
*  I was able to kind of trick people.
*  So you were three years into your act and you were headlining on the road off of television.
*  Off of TV, yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  But you know, I packed a lot into the first three years.
*  Like I was doing...
*  Because you know, a lot of people you're just trying to find stage time, but somehow I got lucky.
*  I was getting tons of stage time.
*  So for three years, I was doing like six nights, seven nights a week of multiple shows.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  So I was getting lots...
*  I was getting material quickly, I think.
*  A lot of reps.
*  A lot of reps, yeah.
*  I did the show for Adam Barnhart for a year every Sunday night.
*  He would give me ten minutes in brand new comic.
*  You know, that's huge when you're brand new comic.
*  So I was building material quickly.
*  But like for as far as like a good set was like 30 minutes.
*  But then I would do the crowd work and I would sprinkle it in.
*  And so it would, you know, turn out to be a decent 45 minute show.
*  And then I just kept doing that.
*  And then I was on Chelsea for four years.
*  I left Chelsea to do acting.
*  And then stand-up took a little bit of a dip.
*  But then I did my half hour for Netflix.
*  It came back up again.
*  And I was doing well at clubs the last couple years.
*  And then my Netflix special, Sweet and Salty, just came out.
*  And I've been...
*  This is my first theater tour and it's been selling well.
*  How did it...
*  So now I feel...
*  I guess to answer your question, right now.
*  Right now, 13 years in.
*  13 years in.
*  Because in stand-up, 13 years is like nothing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like people...
*  13 years to get into a theater tour at 13 years is amazing.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know the...
*  My timeline's so all over the place that I don't know.
*  That's really good.
*  13 years I was in doing a theater tour.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is my first one.
*  And, you know, that's the nice thing about the Netflix reach, you know, is that...
*  Does anybody come up to you and go, I love Sirius.
*  Sometimes, yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think though, Netflix is like 90% of the reach?
*  For the theater tour?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  The special?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've done a lot of acting the last few years.
*  I've been...
*  I did the Mindy project for three seasons and some other things.
*  A bunch of guest stars, some movies.
*  What kind of contract do you guys have for doing that Sirius thing?
*  I think we signed a year contract.
*  And then it's kind of like, we'll see it a year if everyone's happy.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  Let's talk after the show.
*  Okay.
*  I have some suggestions.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the special, as far as stand-up, I mean, I feel like I've...
*  A lot of people, because they knew me from acting, didn't know I was a stand-up.
*  But stand-up's always been so important to me.
*  And I was always on the road.
*  Even when I was acting, I was constantly headlining.
*  And I ran into Bill like a year ago on the road and he was like, what are you doing?
*  I'm like, I've been headlining.
*  He goes, you're headlining?
*  I go, yeah.
*  People don't know I've been headlining since 2010.
*  I just don't talk about it.
*  I just do my shows.
*  And now that I had my special come out, it's really great.
*  It's like I'm doing these cool theaters.
*  We're adding two shows most nights.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's awesome.
*  That's amazing.
*  People have been really lovely.
*  That's awesome.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  That's really cool.
*  I appreciate it.
*  And it's different than, like I said, it's a lot of storytelling.
*  Now, what do you do in terms of now that your special's out and then you're going to tour again?
*  How much new material?
*  I have about 40 minutes of new material.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  I'm still working.
*  When does your tour start?
*  Saturday.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Grand Rapids.
*  So are you going to throw some of the old bits in there?
*  I'll do a few classics.
*  Yeah, you got it.
*  Some people like that shit.
*  Nate Bregazzi was like, you should do your new stuff, do as far as you can, and then throw in some classics because people enjoy that.
*  They liked it from, they want new stuff, but then they like certain bits and why not?
*  Yeah, well, fans.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like there's some people that like Gaffigan has to do his fucking Hot Pockets bit or blow a gasket.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's certain people that like Sebastian does a lot of his classic bits when he does The Road.
*  Yeah.
*  He does a lot of that.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's, you know, the challenge as you know, it's like, oh crap, now I got to like, what's my story that I want to tell next?
*  Yeah.
*  What do I want to say?
*  So that's what I'm working on.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's I mean, that's the beautiful thing about being a writer, right?
*  Do you smoke weed?
*  Here and there.
*  It's not like a regular occurrence.
*  Maybe you should make it a regular.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I will say that I did this weed dinner with Chelsea where we ate like a five course meal that was all cooked with weed.
*  Oh great.
*  And I, because I love food, ate every course and like cleaned the plate.
*  I was like high as a kite, but I have never been funnier.
*  And I'm like, why don't I do this more often?
*  Did they give you transportation?
*  Yeah, they did.
*  Oh, I couldn't have.
*  I could barely walk by the end of the night.
*  Some people go into a fucking K-hole if you give them that much weed.
*  Oh, it was a lot.
*  I think I had like four joints.
*  Wow.
*  It was a lot like I was high at noon the next day.
*  But people to this day are like that weed dinner was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
*  Well, if everybody's high like that.
*  Yeah.
*  As long as you're in a good place.
*  Yeah, I was in a good place.
*  And then at the very end of the night, it was all fog.
*  I don't like nothing.
*  I like I remember sort of getting into the car.
*  I don't remember any of the drive and then open the door to my house and then blank again.
*  It was too much.
*  It was too much.
*  I do remember thinking in my head like don't text anyone.
*  Don't because you don't know or don't tweet.
*  You don't know what you're going to say right now.
*  So I just made myself pass out.
*  That's good.
*  That's perfect.
*  You slid right into home plate.
*  Yeah, that's perfect.
*  You made it perfect.
*  I nailed the landing.
*  There's not too much.
*  That's the exact right now.
*  Like you you you actually came in perfect.
*  But I think yeah, I should because it did sort of open something in my head.
*  Oh, yeah, that let the silliness just run.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  So I should do a little bit, you know, when I'm right.
*  Yeah, start right now.
*  Just want some right now.
*  Sure.
*  Hey kids, don't try to sit home.
*  We got a speed.
*  We just I'm gonna have to go home and write the new tour starting.
*  Yeah, I learned how to I don't even know.
*  I will tell you this because you were talking about Elon.
*  Your name sure being held I because I normally just do a little edibles.
*  I don't even know if I know how to smoke it, right?
*  I'm like the lamest person.
*  Oh hush.
*  No, you're not just a little bit of that.
*  That's a blunt tobacco on the outside weed on the inside.
*  I don't know if I know how to inhale right?
*  I figured out Bill Clinton.
*  Well, this isn't like Bill Clinton.
*  This isn't rocket science.
*  I think you good blow it out.
*  Just blow it out.
*  Yeah, let me see.
*  There's nothing in there.
*  Did it go in?
*  Seems like it did.
*  I think it went in.
*  Let's hold on to that.
*  You like don't do anymore.
*  Let's see how it works.
*  I like gulp that.
*  I was talking to Chappelle Lacey.
*  You know Chappelle?
*  Yeah, like the dude who's like a unbelievable athlete.
*  He was a cheerleading champion.
*  Oh, really level six world champion cheerleader and he's built like a tank.
*  I don't know him.
*  He is he's really funny, but he's he's funny.
*  Like he's never never smoked weed.
*  He's like, I think maybe I want to try it.
*  I was like, listen, if you try it, try it with a friend and try a tiny bit.
*  Yeah, try with a friend of smokes weed.
*  I just want you to go like this.
*  A little puff.
*  Hold on to it.
*  That's it.
*  Don't go crazy.
*  You have a bad experience.
*  Hold it in your mouth.
*  I mean, I inhale it.
*  Oh, God goes all the way in your lungs.
*  I'm pretty sure it's in my lungs.
*  I think I'm like, do you feel any different?
*  You feel any different?
*  Not yet.
*  I do.
*  You do?
*  Yeah, immediately.
*  Immediately.
*  Yeah, I feel like.
*  Woo.
*  Elevated.
*  Nothing.
*  No, but I feel like it definitely went down my throat.
*  But did it go all the way in like this and then all the way out?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think it did.
*  What if it did and I'm like, you don't need it.
*  You don't need it.
*  You're good.
*  I'm high on life.
*  I don't want you to I don't want you to freak out.
*  Well, no, I'll freak out.
*  I won't freak out.
*  We have people freak out.
*  Who's the biggest freak out we've ever had in here?
*  High.
*  About a few.
*  Like where they just start acting way different.
*  Sturgill Simpson told me he's not used to he's he lives.
*  I love Sturgill.
*  Yeah, he lives outside of Nashville.
*  That weed they have is I don't know.
*  It's not good.
*  Well, the way he was getting the stuff out here is like beyond beyond.
*  Yeah.
*  So we got barbecued before the podcast because I know he loves weed.
*  Yeah.
*  And he goes, dude, that podcast started.
*  I didn't know where the fuck I was.
*  I don't know what you're saying.
*  I don't remember anything.
*  Who's sitting there like locked in and then all of a sudden it's live too.
*  That was the other thing back then.
*  We did it live.
*  Yeah, which freaked a lot of people out just a live aspect of it.
*  They weren't sure what they would say.
*  There was like attention to it.
*  There's attention to the fact that all these eyeballs were on you right now currently.
*  Right.
*  Some strange reason.
*  Could you tell that he was like, you know, I was high as fuck too.
*  Oh, you're I don't know.
*  I mean, I'm not immune to it.
*  The only person that ever like gets gets me scared is Joey.
*  Oh, because he just he goes so deep.
*  Yeah, he goes so deep.
*  It doesn't even make sense.
*  He'll he'll throw down four stars of death.
*  Those are 250 milligrams and he does in front of you and he's laughing.
*  That's crazy.
*  He had to see the devil Joe Rogan.
*  He's always trying to see the devil.
*  He gave me some some pills to give to my lady.
*  Oh my God, the pills are dangerous.
*  But I was like, don't give her.
*  I don't know if you should take these.
*  No, he gave one to Tom Segura.
*  Tom Segura has a bit about it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't want to give away the bit.
*  Yeah, I don't want to.
*  Oh, it's in the special.
*  No, no, no.
*  It's a new one that he's working on.
*  Yeah, got you got you.
*  Recent occurrence.
*  Yeah, Joey dosed him.
*  Yeah, well, he tried.
*  I did Joey's podcast a while ago.
*  He tried to get you.
*  He tried to get me.
*  I was like, I don't know about this.
*  Oh, he's fucked some people's lives up for real.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, legitimately, because they go so they look.
*  This is something I had a guy on the podcast,
*  Alex Berenstein, who was it?
*  Berenson, Berenson.
*  He wrote a book and I had him on with a doctor.
*  It was a cannabis enthusiast.
*  This guy, Dr.
*  Mike Hart from Canada.
*  And one of the things that they talked about is
*  how marijuana to some people
*  can potentially induce schizophrenia.
*  Oh, and that's for real.
*  Real. Yeah, I think it's for real.
*  Yeah.
*  And so some people are so you think that happened to some of the people.
*  Joey, you'd have to ask Joe.
*  Oh, I'll tell you off air.
*  OK, for sure.
*  I think it can do that.
*  And for sure, I think I know people that have done that
*  that have lost their fucking minds.
*  Dang, because it's an alteration of reality.
*  But is it that star death stuff you're talking about?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, those and the Chiba chews that are even more strong.
*  Chiba chews that are 500 milligrams.
*  Savages.
*  I don't think it's legal anymore.
*  I think once they went full legal, there's is that the case, Jamie?
*  It's like 10 milligrams each now.
*  100 milligram per per container.
*  Right.
*  So if you get gummy bears, you'll have 10 that are 10 milligrams.
*  And that's 100.
*  So you'd have to take two and a half bottles to equal one of the old ones.
*  First of all, this is my I had a whole bit about this.
*  These fucking things aren't
*  they're not making these things in a lab right next door to a place where they're making microchips.
*  Right.
*  There's some dude, some dude is fucking cooking this shit up in some bullshit commercial kitchen
*  that he got his friends to chip in money for.
*  I mean, who knows who's making these things?
*  I mean, I'm sure a lot of them are being made by giant businesses now.
*  It's a thing now.
*  Yeah.
*  But back in the day, especially like right now, I can't really speak of it.
*  I'm ignorant.
*  I'm just joking around.
*  But back in the day when you would first get edibles, you had no idea.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure there's some testing methods.
*  I'm just fucking around.
*  If you're a grower, you like, bro, let me educate you.
*  I'm sure.
*  But back in the day, the only ones that ever worked on me that like I would just fall asleep.
*  Yeah, I found out it was like a grandma making them in her house that because she liked them.
*  Oh, she would sell her leftovers to this one particular dispensary.
*  I was like, but then they went away.
*  I could never get away again.
*  Yeah, I would trust the grandma.
*  It's the edibles.
*  But the star death one is 250.
*  Is that what you said?
*  Yes, that's an insane amount.
*  A thousand?
*  No, wait, he would tell you for a four of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, easy.
*  Easy.
*  He could do a thousand.
*  He could do two thousand.
*  That's that's great.
*  Joey can just eat it.
*  He doesn't eat.
*  Yeah, it freaks him out and he throws two more down.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  Does he do it on a regular basis?
*  Yes, we landed somewhere.
*  He's like, I almost had a fucking panic attack.
*  I was like, oh my God, I was so high.
*  He was I'm taking two more.
*  Fuck it.
*  He throws two more down and goes out.
*  He was so pumped about those pills that he gave me.
*  I was like, you're just wasting it on me.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't do this.
*  He's my favorite person.
*  Oh, I just don't know anybody like him.
*  I love Josh Wolf's old stories about them coming up together.
*  You're in Seattle, I think.
*  He's just a genuine human.
*  Yeah, funny.
*  I like him a lot.
*  But the thing is this Berenson guy, Alex Berenson, who wrote
*  this book, had a really good point.
*  Is that we think it's fine because it's fine for you.
*  But that doesn't seem to be the case for everybody.
*  Everybody has a different point they can go to.
*  I think people have different brain chemistry, right?
*  That's one of the reasons why some people have depression
*  running their family.
*  And we could all say, oh, hey, you just got to suck it up.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  Because we're built in a way where we can suck it up.
*  That's true.
*  But also, it's like, I don't know how your brain is working.
*  It's just guesswork.
*  There's no thing.
*  I could take your temperature.
*  And if your temperature is like 96, whatever the fuck it is,
*  it's hot.
*  What's hot?
*  What is it normally?
*  98.5 is normal, right?
*  96, yeah.
*  And then so 99.5 and 100 is higher.
*  Yeah, we start getting pretty warm.
*  That's weird.
*  How come the float tank, they want it to be 94?
*  94 is like the sweet spot.
*  They say that's the surface of your skin?
*  Yeah, as I say, your internal temperature is 98.6.
*  But when you get to the outside, it's not probably the exact same.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not a doctor.
*  Yeah, I'm not a doctor either.
*  But my point is you can measure that.
*  Right.
*  But you can't measure how a person feels.
*  No.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, so we could assume, oh, they just
*  got to get their shit together.
*  But it could be a thing like a thyroid issue.
*  Right.
*  Or it could be a thing like a, like some people
*  are born with bad vision.
*  Right?
*  Why wouldn't we assume that that would
*  be the case with mood too?
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  With mood.
*  Of course.
*  It's got to be.
*  Some people are born having less happiness.
*  There's less of a feeling of joy, like maybe
*  an overwhelming sense of gloom just genetically.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we all know people who've just always been kind of down.
*  Right.
*  Now, if you give certain people like that some medication,
*  it can help them.
*  Right?
*  And I think.
*  It's a leveling thing, right?
*  It levels certain things out.
*  I mean, it's not an exact science.
*  Right.
*  They're always trying to find things that work for you.
*  But they can help you.
*  Like if people are in a situation where I know people
*  that have been really suicidal and they got on some stuff
*  and it helped them a lot.
*  And then they slowly wean themselves off of it
*  after they had improved their lives
*  and they found they didn't need it anymore.
*  Yeah, because it dulls other things.
*  It's some of that stuff, you know?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  It's tricky.
*  You're messing with brain chemistry.
*  You know?
*  Like hopefully it works.
*  Right.
*  But the goal is to get you feeling better than you feel.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  But I feel like since some people need that
*  and some people don't, it just makes sense
*  that some people would interact with everything differently
*  than you would.
*  Right.
*  Whether it's alcohol or drugs or cocaine or amphetamines.
*  There's some people that get a taste of amphetamines
*  and they can't get enough.
*  Yeah.
*  And then other people don't want to have
*  nothing to do with that shit.
*  They're like, get that crazy fucking sauce away from me.
*  I don't want to be running around like a maniac.
*  I barely take like an Advil.
*  That stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But I wonder what it is about weed
*  that can open some other portal to,
*  like you said, the schizophrenia thing for some people.
*  Again, obviously I'm an idiot and I don't know anything
*  about what I'm talking about.
*  But I would imagine that what's going on
*  is that some people have a tendency
*  to lean towards mental illness anyway.
*  Maybe they're struggling a bit.
*  And then something comes along like a big dose of edibles
*  and it just knocks their already shaky cart
*  off the trail.
*  They just can't do it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just too much.
*  It's a blowout event that their brain wasn't ready for.
*  Oh, man.
*  That's what I think.
*  And I think there's a bunch of mitigating factors.
*  I would like to know, when do these people experience
*  these bouts of schizophrenia?
*  Is it directly related to stress?
*  Is it directly, is it just something
*  that's genetically they're predisposed to?
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows?
*  But he was saying that it's possible
*  and we don't know what the numbers are.
*  But some people might have real mental health episodes
*  because of a high dose of weed.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  I think we've got to, here's the real problem.
*  The problem is because it's been illegal for so long,
*  they haven't funded adequate testing.
*  And it wasn't even legal to test on for a long time.
*  It's like the federal government has
*  to approve whether or not you can test
*  on shit that's schedule one.
*  If you wanted to do some studies,
*  and you wanted to do some studies on cocaine
*  and what it's like when people use cocaine,
*  what's the effect of cocaine?
*  Like you're going to fund cocaine studies.
*  Right.
*  They're like, it's illegal.
*  Why would we want to get to the bottom of what it does to you?
*  Definitely.
*  What?
*  Cocaine might not be schedule one, right?
*  You might be right because it's got medical.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  So schedule one is all the good stuff.
*  It's mushrooms.
*  Schedule one is mushrooms.
*  All the stuff they can get you to see God is schedule one.
*  hallucinogenic stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Is heroin schedule one?
*  It is.
*  That's interesting.
*  What about morphine?
*  Because morphine, don't they still use that shit in the hospital?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  If I would say morphine is out.
*  That button is rude.
*  The fact they give you the ability to just juice yourself up.
*  That's so crazy.
*  You can just hammer that thing.
*  Because why would you stop?
*  Why would you stop?
*  Especially if you could feel sorry for yourself.
*  You're at surgery.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, nobody wants to sit there in pain.
*  No.
*  Fuck that.
*  You're like.
*  Especially when you're just sitting there anyway.
*  Let's go for a ride.
*  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
*  Let's put five quarters into this ride.
*  It's like I don't know.
*  I can do that and go, OK, I don't want to do that ever again.
*  But some people can't.
*  And I don't think we should think of that as anything other than a chemical thing.
*  Seems like there's going to be behavioral things with people, right?
*  There's some people that are addicted to gambling, right?
*  It's not a chemical thing.
*  But it still kind of is.
*  It's a rush.
*  Yeah.
*  I think all that behavioral shit, it all ties in together.
*  It's really interesting.
*  Like dopamine.
*  Yeah.
*  Like spurt.
*  Well, it's really interesting to think how other people's brains work.
*  We were talking about Elon Musk.
*  He's too smart.
*  He's too smart.
*  I can't imagine what it would be like looking through that guy's brain.
*  His brain works different than mine.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Right?
*  There's different brains out there.
*  And some of them create wild art, right?
*  Well, there's also the middle part.
*  The pistons have to shoot.
*  You have pistons?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Beep, beep, beep, beep, boop.
*  They have to connect.
*  In the left brain and the right brain.
*  There's the whole left brain, right brain thing.
*  I've never looked into that.
*  Sometimes the wires are crossed.
*  So that's why some people are better at math.
*  Some people are better at writing.
*  You know, there's a different part of your brains affect those.
*  That's interesting.
*  I wonder if there's going to be a way to target those.
*  I bet there's going to be a way where they put something on your head
*  because the things they do for PTSD patients,
*  they do this thing where they energize with magnets,
*  some crazy magnetic thing.
*  It concentrates on a certain area of your brain where they feel you've been damaged.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And fighters and some people with CTE injuries from the war,
*  they've gone to this.
*  It's near where the bases are down in San Diego.
*  Pretty close.
*  I think maybe within an hour of San Diego.
*  And they use magnets to stimulate your brain.
*  I'm obviously butchering it.
*  But somehow or another, they're helping your brain heal itself.
*  Right.
*  When I hear something like that, I'm like, okay, what if you just juiced up the right side?
*  Right.
*  What if you just juice it every day?
*  Like nothing's wrong with it.
*  Nothing's wrong with it.
*  But I just want you to juice the fuck out of it.
*  I'd like to be able to pass my math test today.
*  Imagine if they came up with a technology.
*  If they can come up with a technology that allows you to help your brain heal.
*  And I know this is stupid and I know I'm not a biologist.
*  But if they came up with that and they can help use these super magnets or whatever it is,
*  from the outside you're wearing like a helmet or something and it juices up your brain
*  and helps your brain heal itself.
*  Right.
*  Why couldn't they make you smarter?
*  I don't know why it stops.
*  Could you fucking imagine if they just started using like really rich people just started wearing those helmets all day
*  and just juicing their brain up all day and their brains just keep getting bigger
*  and their heads start growing?
*  Oh my God.
*  What if that is the future hot look, right?
*  Future hot look.
*  Like the hot look used to be like the bigger the person,
*  like if a king wasn't fat, he wasn't attractive.
*  Like kings wanted to look fat because that would mean you had all this wealth.
*  Right.
*  And all this prosperity.
*  Yeah.
*  And then people got skinny like it's oh this means you're fit.
*  This is the ideal.
*  Maybe one day the ideal is going to be big fat.
*  Big fucking alien head.
*  You're so smart.
*  You just juicing your brain up.
*  I didn't even know you could I don't know much about even repairing your brain.
*  You always heard that once you mess it up, it's messed up.
*  Yeah, I think they're they're learning.
*  I mean, there's I mean, there's for sure therapies that they're doing,
*  but I think they're learning a bunch of different methods of how to help people heal from certain brain injuries.
*  Yeah.
*  And this was part of that.
*  It's I mean, it's really the brain is such a weird one, right?
*  It's because that's how you interface with the whole world.
*  Their whole body is like, you know, it affects everything.
*  It affects how you see things and think about things.
*  It's where you control all of your emotions.
*  It's how you stand up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's who you are.
*  And the brain is a strange thing to fuck with.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you're like you're juicing the pump station.
*  That's why I'm like you ride a motorcycle, put a helmet on.
*  Yes.
*  You know, please do.
*  Have you seen the videos when they're doing brain operations and they like I think they make the people like play a guitar.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, there's a video of a girl playing the violin.
*  Yeah, during surgery.
*  I think you lose the ability or they're afraid of maybe they're afraid they might lose that ability if they're not continuing to do it.
*  Right.
*  Jesus Christ, that's nuts.
*  The best is when people wake up from brain surgery and they have this whole their skill, you know,
*  there's like stories of people like suddenly being fluent in Spanish.
*  You're like what?
*  Yeah, they can play instruments.
*  I've heard that.
*  I mean, I don't know anybody like that, but I hear stories.
*  You know what's funny?
*  That is a really fascinating idea that someone could get a brain injury and come back with some new special skill or a language.
*  You would think I would looked into that.
*  Yeah, you would think I would have read about that.
*  I haven't looked into that shit once.
*  Well, I was reading an article about Mary Stenberg and she married a Ted dancing.
*  I don't know how to say her last name.
*  Yeah, she had a she had some sort of injuries.
*  She had surgery.
*  I don't know if it was brain or not.
*  It might have been brain something.
*  She came back and had suddenly the ability to write music.
*  Well, and she like wrote the songs for like a soundtrack of a movie that just came out and it was and she never had that.
*  Oh, the Stenberg brain became became musical.
*  Brain became musical after a strange complication from a routine surgery.
*  Wow.
*  All my thoughts became musical.
*  Oh my God.
*  Who discovered a new passion for songwriting.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah, that stuff's trippy.
*  That's weird.
*  That's what I was saying earlier.
*  It's like everybody's brain is just different.
*  We all want to hold people like the way they think to a certain standard, right?
*  They want people to think everybody wants everybody else to think the way they do.
*  They want to enforce their ideas and thoughts.
*  We just have to come up with a better way of a better way of expressing that no one has any idea how you see the world.
*  Right.
*  The way we talk to each other, we assume that your version of the world is exactly the same as my version of the world.
*  That we're coming from the same place.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but not only are you coming from a different environment, but your brain.
*  Your brain's different.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  Like the way some people see the world, they just see it different than you.
*  They're looking through a different window.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can tell when you're talking to those people.
*  We got to be a little bit more, I think we have to be a little bit more understanding of some people like that.
*  That's where all the weirdos, that's where the crazy ones come from.
*  That's why they say that, oh, that person's wired differently.
*  You don't think Quentin Tarantino is wired differently.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, how are you going to make a movie like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, unless you're wired differently?
*  Right.
*  That you can see this alternative ending to this horrific story.
*  You want to go on a ride through that dude's brain?
*  Yeah, man.
*  You know, who knows what's going on there?
*  That guy creates some fucking wild dark images.
*  Oh, I know.
*  But you know, that guy's, his brain is different.
*  It's fucking different.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why a lot of this, you can do it stuff that you hear, like inspirational shit that you hear.
*  Like you can do anything.
*  Just set your mind to it.
*  Not always.
*  Not everybody.
*  No, not really.
*  Just like, you know.
*  Well, you want to think positive.
*  That's always like if you can think on the positive side, but not everybody can physically do everything.
*  You should definitely think positive in terms of energy, in terms of the way you view people and accept the moments.
*  But you shouldn't think positive in terms of you can do something that's not physically possible.
*  Yeah, you shouldn't jump on a moving vehicle.
*  You shouldn't.
*  Like if I decided at 52, I want to play football in the NFL.
*  Right.
*  That's not physically possible.
*  It's literally not physically possible.
*  You might be wired different after that.
*  I'd be wired different for sure.
*  I'd be wired up.
*  My career would last 10 seconds if I was lucky and that would be it.
*  That is just physical reality.
*  It doesn't matter how much positive thinking I do.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, I'm not going to change.
*  There's no changing.
*  I'm not winning any sprinting contest.
*  I can't dunk.
*  There's nothing special happening here.
*  You know, like that's physical reality.
*  It doesn't matter how much positive thinking I ever have.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  That's where people get weird.
*  Well, that's like when people who don't believe in science, you know, someone gets sick.
*  They go, we'll pray.
*  We'll pray that it will take it away.
*  You go, okay.
*  Listen, I'm not knocking praying.
*  Pray all day.
*  But at some point this person needs medicine.
*  Yeah, you know, God invented people.
*  People figured out medicine.
*  God made medicine.
*  Just take the medicine.
*  Just take the medicine.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Just people that are studying their entire lives to try to figure out how to fix you.
*  They're not always right, but they're right way more than you are or naturopaths.
*  Sometimes you just need medicine.
*  I'm sure there's real naturopaths out there.
*  I'm sure there are.
*  But just the term makes me go, what are you doing?
*  Did you go to real school for that?
*  Naturopath, I'm sure is a real thing.
*  But for sure also, there's a lot of people that are like kind of faking that thing.
*  Yeah, that like they don't telling you how to heal yourself and tell you telling you what herbs to take like, hey, where's the evidence?
*  Right.
*  There's evidence.
*  These herbs are doing jack shit.
*  They're like just drink celery juice like homeopathy.
*  That shit's that's nonsense, right?
*  Isn't it?
*  I don't know.
*  Has that been proved to be nonsense about it?
*  Homeopathic medicine, right?
*  There's a certain amount of you just believe in you got some medicine, right?
*  Yeah, all like the placebo effect.
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  There's a certain amount of that.
*  I mean, if you take something that's like sugar pills and you've definitely feel it could made a big difference to your illness took a turn for the better.
*  We just immediately start thinking that.
*  But yeah, but we know that's not possible.
*  There's no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions.
*  Some practitioners also claim homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases.
*  There's no evidence to support this and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases.
*  NHS UK.
*  Yeah, that's those English people though.
*  They're probably trying to save money on their socialized medicine.
*  Kidding.
*  Yeah, I think if you believe that, you know, eating walnuts is going to going to make you feel like you have more energy and feel pure and someone tells you and convince you.
*  You eat those walnuts.
*  You'll start feeling different for sure.
*  You decide you feel different in like, I don't know what percentage of people you're not going to get the really skeptical people.
*  Yeah, the real cynical people.
*  But for some people you give them some sugar pills and it'll work if they really believe it works.
*  We don't even know why that is.
*  We don't know.
*  No one.
*  They don't understand the placebo effect.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's real.
*  It's measurable.
*  And I think depending upon how much you buy into it, I bet that has a big impact on the effectiveness.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Because if you buy in 100 percent, you do I think feel that change.
*  But if you're like, yeah, this is not going to do anything.
*  Yeah, it's not going to be the same.
*  It's almost like some religions are that's what they are.
*  They're a theological sugar pill.
*  Like some religions are just if you believe if just really believe you get rewarded if you really believe and that's like the that's the pull of a cult.
*  Right.
*  That's how you start any wacky cult.
*  Oh, well, yeah.
*  You got to really believe.
*  Do you really believe?
*  I believe too.
*  We all believe together.
*  Right.
*  Oh my God, we're so connected.
*  We all believe together.
*  And they're saying they got the answer.
*  Oh, you got the answer.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and that's also how you get people to you know, the churches that do the tithing.
*  Yes, it's beautiful.
*  10 percent.
*  10 percent.
*  That's a good amount of money.
*  That's a big chunk of change.
*  Good slice of cash.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good slice of cash right there.
*  I don't know.
*  Mormons tithe.
*  Is that still a thing in other churches?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Some some Christian religions definitely do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Tithe.
*  They 10 percent.
*  Man.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  Yeah, especially if you're an entertainer and you're giving your agent 10 and your manager 10.
*  Yeah.
*  It's um, I don't know if Jesus would have wanted you to give payments like that.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think he would have.
*  I see his method is we just pass the collection plate and you know, if you put a dollar, how's that different than a 20?
*  It's like I put I gave something wouldn't Jesus be just happy that I made the effort?
*  Yeah, it's almost like they should just charge a membership fee.
*  Like stop fucking around.
*  Like do you get more prayers if you put in a 20?
*  That's a good question.
*  I bet you do.
*  I bet you get preferential treatment.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it like raffle ticket?
*  Is it like raffle ticket?
*  It's like raffle tickets.
*  Yes.
*  I would like $20 worth of prayers.
*  Well, do you remember when preachers these late night preachers they came up with this really dastardly move and the really dastardly move was to convince poor
*  people to send them all of their money and that God would return it tenfold or twofold or whatever it is and they had all these different stories of all these poor
*  gullible people that they were telling.
*  I mean, I don't know who was doing the stories where they would tell the success stories.
*  Right.
*  I did this and this happened to me and I made so much money afterwards and now we have a house.
*  We have a car and they get these people convinced.
*  If I just send my last remaining imagine targeting people's last remaining dollars.
*  There's a special place in hell.
*  That's it.
*  Did that not some of that televangelist stuff is, you know, really prayed on that especially back in the day.
*  It was like, like you said those commercials look at what they have because they did this for the church for us.
*  It's crazy.
*  Meanwhile, the preachers are flying jets.
*  There was a preacher.
*  I think I heard on Stern.
*  There's a preacher that told the church flat out.
*  I need another plane.
*  I need you to donate money.
*  You're like what?
*  That's a bunch of them have done that.
*  Yeah.
*  And there was one it was a woman interviewed this preacher as he was getting into his limo just getting off his plane.
*  She asked him is it because you think poor people are demons?
*  God he he had said something crazy about he doesn't want to fly commercially with all those demons.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's like aka poor people.
*  Yeah, this is the guy.
*  Oh man.
*  And he says don't you say that don't you say I said that you like me he got really serious with her pointed in her face.
*  It was very scary.
*  Man that was all the rage because I'm from outside of Charlotte.
*  It was a Tammy Faye and Jim Baker.
*  Jim Baker just had to be shut down.
*  He was selling some fake coronavirus shit.
*  He went to prison right now.
*  He's out and about making things happen.
*  He had a fake coronavirus thing that apparently he got busted for it.
*  They told him to stop stop selling that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Man.
*  There it is Missouri Attorney General sues Jim Baker over misleading coronavirus cure claims.
*  Oh that just came out bro.
*  That's what he looks like now.
*  It looks great.
*  Yeah, he looks great is the best he's looked in years.
*  Oh he was selling it for on his website.
*  A hundred totally eliminated kills it deactivates it.
*  That's what it said.
*  I love when guys like I love when guys go to prison for being shady and they're like not stopping.
*  Look at that the product is to $125 and it shows website.
*  So he's saying he's got a hundred twenty five dollar cure for the coronavirus.
*  It does not exist.
*  It was like cleaning.
*  Oh my god.
*  Is that cleaning products?
*  Just selling them Drano.
*  He just took the label off.
*  Just drink this hand sanitizer when you throw up.
*  That's the demon coming out of you.
*  Oh my god.
*  I didn't know he was still a wheeling and dealing.
*  Still wheeling and dealing.
*  Is he still preaching?
*  I think he is.
*  Yeah, I think he has a TV show.
*  Well, he's out there rocking it.
*  Oh, he does the Jim Baker show.
*  Kapow.
*  Shout out to the Jim Baker show.
*  Yeah, North Carolina.
*  I don't know.
*  Imagine if he really did have he really did have the cure and we were mocking.
*  I know and he's like you assholes.
*  What if it was like one scientist that lives in the woods?
*  And he brought the guy in and the guy had the cure and they figured out it worked.
*  But no one else knew.
*  He can't get fucked over by the FDA.
*  So he's just going to sell it from his website.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like I tried to tell you.
*  I thought I sold it for a deal.
*  What if Jim Baker becomes the king of the world?
*  He's the only one left.
*  Everyone else is like we don't have the cure.
*  We don't have a vaccine.
*  It's just him and his believers.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Damn.
*  We'll find out.
*  Tune in.
*  Tune in folks.
*  Man.
*  Tune in next week.
*  But I miss Tammy Faye.
*  Rest in peace.
*  She was a wild one, huh?
*  Anybody that gets their makeup tattooed on.
*  Does she get her tattooed on the whole deal?
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  Yeah.
*  All the risky move.
*  All that eye makeup.
*  You letting somebody drill ink into your eyelids.
*  Whoa.
*  I think it's like become like more women do it than you think.
*  It's just that they do a lot better job now.
*  They have like better tools and techniques.
*  So people get them tattooed on but you can't tell.
*  I think we're one or two generations from them being able to do whatever the fuck you want.
*  Right.
*  What do you want your face to look like?
*  Go to like a thing.
*  One or two generations like 50 years from now.
*  But you know like I feel like what the you know people can change their face so much already.
*  It takes out some of that when people fix certain things they take away what was unique about them.
*  You know Jennifer Grey.
*  Dirty dancing.
*  Yeah sometimes people fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And you with your face you can't really go back.
*  Yeah, it's hard right?
*  You can't be like.
*  Lips are real hard.
*  My bad.
*  Yeah.
*  You know some guys got convinced that they needed to get their lips thicker and so they had surgeries on them.
*  Or had their lips opened up.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's so painful.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know so you can get scar tissue anytime you have surgeries.
*  You get weird spots.
*  That's why I became a comedian.
*  That's why you didn't want to get your lips done.
*  Lips are weird too if they don't match your face.
*  Yeah.
*  Immediately you're like what's happening here.
*  It's just the ratios off.
*  Yeah.
*  You know but I think that people thought because they could do it with tits why can't they do it with lips.
*  Like let's keep this party rolling.
*  Let's make everything ridiculous.
*  Like ridiculous tits.
*  We're like okay we're in.
*  I've heard that small boobs are in.
*  They're back.
*  That's what that's the word on the street.
*  I'm off the market so I haven't been testing it.
*  That's probably like people have trends right?
*  Yeah.
*  People are like getting their implants removed too.
*  Well that's good for health reasons.
*  Right.
*  You know some people there's a woman named Kat Singano and she fought in the UFC.
*  Now she fights for Bellator.
*  She was one of the top Band of Wayne contenders.
*  She fought Ronda Rousey for the title.
*  Yeah.
*  She had hers removed and she detailed it on her Instagram.
*  Talked about all the negative effects it was having on her health wise.
*  And now once she got them removed she felt infinitely better.
*  Well especially the old implants you know how they were leaking and a lot of people were getting sick from it.
*  Yeah.
*  But the problem is apparently it's just like everything else like stuff we were talking about earlier.
*  Some people have a reaction to it and some people don't.
*  Exactly right.
*  For some people it's like for whatever reason their body rejects it and it creates like an immuno...
*  What's that word?
*  Immunological.
*  Is that the word?
*  Immunological.
*  Sounds right.
*  Response by their immune system.
*  It creates inflammation.
*  Some people have real problems with it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  Well the trend right now small boobs big butts.
*  Wow.
*  That's what I've heard.
*  Interesting.
*  I'm not on the floor.
*  Like a track star.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah pretty much.
*  That makes sense.
*  We need to streamline for when our society collapses.
*  We have to go back to live in the forest.
*  Oh man.
*  Mad Max style.
*  I don't want to live in the forest.
*  This is the like this coronavirus turns out to be just like the flu and everybody just gets the flu.
*  I hope that's the case.
*  But we got to be really prepared for a real one.
*  Right.
*  Because really prepared for like a plague.
*  Yeah.
*  Well because you're seeing how fast this is spreading.
*  Not just that but how underprepared we are.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I say we as if I'm out there doing science.
*  Well you got to get a need funding.
*  Well you got to have tests.
*  You don't have the tests.
*  I think we need to pay way more attention to this shit.
*  I think I don't know what I mean I have no idea if they're underfunded or if it's a matter of scientific innovation like how much time it takes to figure out a new better way to
*  protect from these diseases or if he was talking about some of the existing
*  vaccines that they you know that they could have possibly worked on to make a vaccine for a coronavirus.
*  They never bothered doing it after SARS.
*  Right.
*  Apparently which is another coronavirus type thing like animal to person type thing.
*  Well there's a lot I think apparently a lot of them like that including the flu.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of them are people get it from like pigs as the swine flu birds avian flu.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the jumps.
*  It jumps from the animals to us.
*  We get sick as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Spooky shit.
*  It's really scary because you're already dealing with like life.
*  Right.
*  And then you're like oh you need a plague is rolling through the land.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You keep hearing the words pandemic and it's also this is my take on it like the way we look at it is it.
*  We look at it like it makes sense because people we know about colds.
*  We know colds kill people.
*  We know we know diseases kill people.
*  So it seems to make sense.
*  But if those were demons and not diseases.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know how terrifying the world would be if like all the people that are dying of diseases were really just dying of demons.
*  That would be scary.
*  I would buy that $125 thing Jim Baker was selling.
*  Why is why is it less scary to have them die of disease than it is for them to die from demons if they're both just going to kill you.
*  Why are we saying if we just looked at diseases like demons there's a fucking holy war going on out there.
*  There's a holy war going on out there.
*  The demons are trying to get us.
*  I mean instead we're like oh no it's just covid 19.
*  Stop.
*  It's a demon.
*  Yeah.
*  You guys are mislabeling these diseases.
*  They're all demons.
*  You're like can I take vitamin C for that.
*  We should treat health care in this country the same way we would treat fighting demons.
*  Well how do you even fight demons.
*  They have a path to fight most of those demons like silver bullet fucking stake through the heart.
*  Yes.
*  That's a werewolf.
*  We haven't put enough money into fighting the demons.
*  We've accepted a certain amount of loss of the demons every year.
*  Imagine if that was it.
*  Like we would be so angry at our leadership.
*  You fuck you're invading Afghanistan.
*  You haven't done shit for the demons at home.
*  Everyone's dying demons are claiming everyone.
*  Like how many people die of disease in this country every year.
*  A lot.
*  A lot right.
*  Like a lot of young kids and old folks die from the flu that happens.
*  And this heart disease like the worst one.
*  I'm sure.
*  Yeah but it's not a disease.
*  I'm sorry to say but general like you mean like a contagious disease.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean like something you can't.
*  Like you come down with something.
*  Yeah.
*  Because cancer is a disease too.
*  And a lot of people get cancer.
*  You know we've thought about all that shit like demons.
*  We'd be working harder to fight it.
*  I never thought about that.
*  There's a holy war.
*  There's a fucking holy war out there.
*  But how do we fight it?
*  I don't know.
*  It's not a coronavirus.
*  It's a fucking demon.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's we got to call it.
*  Maybe it's a bitch ass demon.
*  It's only going to kill people with lung problems.
*  You know it's not strong like a strong demon like the Spanish flu or.
*  Shape-shifting demon.
*  Oh dude.
*  Maybe.
*  A cuckoo.
*  A shape-shifter.
*  Like the outside.
*  Are you watching that show?
*  No, but I've heard it's awesome.
*  Very good.
*  I'm deep in.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there only 10 episodes?
*  It's over.
*  I didn't get to the end.
*  These good shows do like eight or 10 episodes.
*  You're like, ah.
*  Well this one can easily make a comeback.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah easily.
*  It's really good.
*  It's a really good show.
*  It's just a really well done horror show.
*  Really?
*  It's a Stephen King.
*  It's based on a Stephen King book.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  Or is it?
*  Did he write it?
*  Did he write?
*  Is it based on a novel or is it something?
*  I know it's his his writing.
*  I believe so.
*  Yeah, he does that a lot.
*  He gives his stories out for young directors to make projects with.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  They nailed it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's really cool.
*  Where where where's the plan?
*  HBO.
*  It's really good.
*  Yeah, but HBO does that thing when they make you fucking wait.
*  Oh, long time.
*  Make you wait a week.
*  Yeah.
*  What's with the waiting?
*  It feels like forever.
*  Streaming.
*  Catch up bitch.
*  Streaming.
*  It's only streaming.
*  I know that's where it can't go back to like 8 p.m.
*  here to an end.
*  I know it's it's it's to wait a week for these shows is so it feels like a month.
*  Well, they also have to give into this idea of like the certain window of prime time.
*  Certain window of prime time, which is, you know, whatever the fuck it is, right?
*  8 to 10 people want to watch whatever the fuck they want to watch.
*  Yeah, they want to download it for their plane ride.
*  Netflix just jacked the whole system.
*  It's like like there's some gears.
*  And that's yeah.
*  Yeah, streaming just fucked everything over for these people that want you to tune in.
*  Have you seen this show?
*  Devs?
*  What is your boy Alex Garland that did Ex Machina?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  It seems like it.
*  I don't know.
*  This is me guessing based off the trailer.
*  It just came out.
*  It looks like it's about the people that make the simulation sort of.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  I'm too high for this.
*  Jamie, I'm too high for this.
*  I'm too high.
*  It's really fun.
*  Nick Offerman is.
*  Oh, that all he's a really he's a good actor.
*  Looks good.
*  Just came out.
*  Have you ever contemplated the idea of life as a simulation?
*  No.
*  Have you ever heard of simulation theory?
*  That's what they're talking about.
*  Like that there will be a like the Matrix type thing.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Oh, I don't know about that.
*  Fucking Elon Musk believes it.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  He said if you had one question, what did he say?
*  He would want to know what's behind the simulation or what's beyond the simulation.
*  You mean like who's controlling it?
*  That was like his one question he would want to have answered.
*  Right.
*  What's on the other side?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like who's controlling the simulation?
*  What's beyond the simulation?
*  I think was his quote.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, he believed he said that it's possible.
*  And then if you talk to some scientists that have tried to study this like look at it objectively.
*  They think it's more probable that we are living in a simulation than not.
*  Yeah, but it would be like yeah, the question really is what it can't just exist, right?
*  Right.
*  Like eventually it's going to be here, right?
*  This is what we all agree.
*  Eventually there's going to come a time where if you think about what you can do now.
*  Have you ever fucked around with one of those like HTC Vives?
*  Oh, they are.
*  Or Oculus?
*  Have you done the Oculus thing?
*  The Oculus one is pretty sweet because it's just a headset.
*  Yeah.
*  And it plugs into a laptop or the iPad rather.
*  So the iPad sitting there plugged in and you step away from it and you're in this fucking world.
*  Yeah, you're in a whole other place.
*  Yeah, you can play all these games.
*  There's boxing games.
*  There's games with swords and shit and you're swiping at like geometric patterns that are flying by you and you're playing drums on them.
*  And it's so realistic.
*  So realistic.
*  And we're this is at its infancy.
*  But we know for sure if they keep going with that, think about what a movie used to look like in 1930.
*  It was so ridiculous.
*  Like watch King Kong.
*  Special effects is so bad.
*  They're so bad.
*  Yeah, it's like for kids today.
*  It's actually funny.
*  I've showed it to my kids and they thought it was funny.
*  Right.
*  But back then it was amazing.
*  Yeah, it was like beyond anything anyone had seen.
*  That's not even a hundred years.
*  Right.
*  So what we can do now with these HTC vibes and these oculus is all these these places like sandbox where you go and play these games and these warehouses with virtual reality.
*  This is just the beginning.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  This stuff is going to be indistinguishable.
*  Right.
*  There's going to come a time where they can create a digital realm that you can exist in and it's indistinguishable from this world.
*  Yeah, that's going to happen.
*  It's going to happen.
*  It's just going to take time.
*  If we don't blow ourselves up, it might take.
*  That's the thing.
*  We have plagues.
*  Yeah.
*  If we don't get eaten by the demons.
*  Climate stuff.
*  We don't get attacked by aliens.
*  We have us if we can survive for a certain amount of time in prosperity.
*  When are the aliens coming to get us?
*  I don't think they're going to come get us.
*  Okay.
*  They're probably going to stop us from destroying the world.
*  I bet they would do that.
*  Yeah, they were really watching.
*  If I was from another planet, I wouldn't think it would be a good idea to fuck with people.
*  Let's just let them sort this out.
*  Hopefully they'll get it right.
*  But I definitely would want to step in before they hit the nukes.
*  Right.
*  You know, like we can't let them nuke the whole planet.
*  These idiots.
*  You know, my God says you guys suck.
*  Yeah, I get the fucking fingers on the nukes like Pakistan and India, right?
*  They both have nuclear weapons.
*  Oh, and they're right next to each other.
*  When Trump was fighting with Kim Jong-un, I was like, I'm like, we're really close.
*  California is very close.
*  Does Pakistan, do they have nuclear weapons as well?
*  I think so.
*  Well, India for certain has, right?
*  They're right next to each other and they hate each other and they get mad.
*  They get fucking missiles.
*  Oh, it's crazy.
*  No, please.
*  There's like one dude that if he's like really pissed off, who's going to stop him, you know?
*  Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction is one of the nine states to possess nuclear weapons.
*  Pakistan began development of nuclear weapons in January of 1972 under Prime Minister Zulfikar al-Buto.
*  Is it Ali-Buto?
*  Zulfikar?
*  I don't want to say his name.
*  I'm fucking it up.
*  No disrespect.
*  Who delegated the program?
*  Okay.
*  And so everyone, it's just like what, a gentleman's agreement that they're not going to use these?
*  Zulfikar Ali-Buto.
*  Prime Minister's, is that it?
*  That's a crazy thing too.
*  Like parts of the world that just have wacky ass names, you know?
*  Like there's a dude who fights in the UFC.
*  He's the UFC lightweight champion and he's from Dagestan.
*  They have a totally different way of using words over there.
*  And their names are crazy.
*  Like his name is Khabib Nurmagomedov.
*  Like this long?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like this powerful, you know, Russian sounding name.
*  Like that so identifies you with that part of the world.
*  Like a name like that.
*  There's a guy, Magomed Sherapov.
*  His name is Zabit Magomed Sherapov.
*  I fucked it up.
*  Think of that name.
*  Zabit Magomed Sherapov.
*  Still sounds terrible.
*  Coming out of my mouth, it sounds terrible.
*  Incredible fighter.
*  And he's from that part of the world too.
*  There he is.
*  Magomed Sherapov.
*  Look at that long name.
*  Like that name shows you that it's that part of the world.
*  It's like, but Mike Jones.
*  Hi, I'm Jim Smith.
*  That's so American, right?
*  We have like a boring ass name development program.
*  Well, we got lazy when people came off the boat, right?
*  They're like, oh, that's too long.
*  We're going to cut it.
*  Hi, Mike Williams.
*  Hi, nice to meet you, Pete.
*  It's William Snovovic.
*  Pete Jones?
*  Pete Jones.
*  Good to see you.
*  Oh, have you met Pete Jones?
*  Which Pete Jones?
*  The Idaho Pete Jones?
*  No, no, no.
*  You know?
*  Or they would just take your trade.
*  Oh, you're Shoemaker.
*  There's your name.
*  Craig Shoemaker.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that nuts?
*  But some parts of the world, they have fucking gallant names.
*  You know, long with like liberal use of Zs.
*  They use a lot of Zs.
*  Yeah.
*  But like some languages though, it's like this huge long name and then it's like a zero
*  with a slash.
*  You're like, that's how they write it.
*  It's like all this long name can be represented by like a tiny symbol.
*  In some languages.
*  Is that true?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm making shit up.
*  I think the weed hit me.
*  Oh, for sure it did.
*  Like a Chinese symbol.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Like that.
*  Imagine having to learn that now at a grown age.
*  As a grown up.
*  Imagine if you had to go learn Mandarin.
*  So hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking really hard.
*  Yeah.
*  You had a brain injury and you just couldn't understand it and you couldn't explain anyone.
*  That's had to have happened.
*  That's had to have happened.
*  What you're seeing.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  The crazy thing about Asian characters too, they developed a whole different way of saying
*  stuff.
*  They developed a way of saying stuff like they can recreate our language inside their
*  language, but they're doing it with these little symbols and they all kind of know what
*  it all means when it's all pushed together like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we look at it as just like a bunch of lines that we don't understand.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  But if you could see it.
*  Like that would be one of the weirder things about like learning to read it.
*  All of a sudden it would look like language.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's no longer just symbols.
*  No longer nonsense.
*  Yeah.
*  Like look at that.
*  And don't they read from certain languages that read the other direction, right?
*  Imagine if you had to write all that out.
*  Like, good Lord.
*  Like that's and that's perfect.
*  Yeah, that's like beautifully.
*  Like imagine like, you know how bad doctors have prescription handwriting stuff?
*  How bad was the slang of that?
*  What's like a guy whose handwriting is terrible?
*  What's his note look like?
*  You know, do you have to really understand Mandarin to sort through that?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, like, oh, that was supposed to have three dots.
*  I've gotten mail, like actual mail from friends, like a Christmas card or something like that.
*  They write something in it.
*  And I'm like, hey, bro, what did you want to say to me?
*  Because I can't read a word of what that scratch was.
*  But they still send it to you.
*  No, that's not.
*  Oh, look at that.
*  What is that?
*  Well, no one teaches handwriting.
*  They don't teach handwriting anymore.
*  Oh, my God.
*  But that's how they're doing it in Chinese.
*  That's the Chinese version of it.
*  See what that is.
*  Oh, oh, Jesus Christ.
*  You imagine what kind of 10th degree black belt in Chinese you'd have to be to even understand what the fuck that is.
*  That's amazing.
*  Of course, though, it just makes sense if we're thinking that people have terrible handwriting in English.
*  Why wouldn't they have terrible handwriting in Chinese?
*  For sure.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's illegible.
*  Like, if you told me that was Chinese, I'm like, bro, that's scribbles.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it looks like bad cursive.
*  OK, that kind of looks like Chinese.
*  But wow, look how everything flows.
*  And it's on top of each other.
*  Oh, it looks like letters that are being attacked by a tornado.
*  Doesn't it?
*  It looks like letters that are all being attacked by cartoon tornadoes.
*  And squiggly lines at the bottom.
*  Everything's a tornado attack.
*  It's a complicated language, though.
*  It's so much more interesting than ours.
*  I'm so bummed out that I'm too stupid to learn it at this day and age.
*  I mean, just to learn Spanish is hard.
*  Spanish is useful, though.
*  There's way more Spanish people over here.
*  Of course.
*  Way more Spanish speaking people over here.
*  But it's not near.
*  The beauty of Spanish is that things sound like they're spelled.
*  The hard part of the English language is so many things are not pronounced how they're spelled.
*  Yeah.
*  So Spanish is very literal.
*  Yeah.
*  And Spanish is all using the same letters that we use.
*  You know, like if you had to learn Russian, like, whoo.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn.
*  You're jumping to a different system.
*  It's a different alphabet.
*  There's a bunch of those little weird Russian symbols.
*  You're like, what is that?
*  That must be how a Russian looks at English if they don't speak it.
*  But the thing is about other countries, a lot of them are bilingual.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We're way behind with that stuff.
*  Way behind.
*  I lived in Spain for a year and everybody there spoke two languages at minimum.
*  And a lot of them were coming from other countries and they spoke multiple languages there.
*  I wonder if that's one of the things that makes places like Italy or countries like that a little bit more artistically sophisticated still.
*  Maybe it's the fact that everybody knows more than one language.
*  I wonder if their brains just work a little better from doing that, processing two languages.
*  Every time I visited Italy, I'm like, how did all this art come out of this one place?
*  I know a lot of it they stole from other spots when they were the Romans.
*  But just the shit that they made for sure in Italy is like this one little country.
*  How the fuck did you guys do this?
*  They had really good coffee.
*  But my argument falls apart under scrutiny because they just spoke Italian back then.
*  They didn't speak English back then, did they?
*  I don't think so.
*  They probably never made contact with each other like they do now.
*  But even now you'll go to a gelato shop and the cashier is fluent in Italian and English.
*  You could make a gazillion dollars being a translator, but they're like, oh, we all know two languages.
*  That's just how it is.
*  Yeah, some of them are perfect.
*  But that's such a valued skill.
*  And rare.
*  And then I don't think they even know how much they have, like what value they have in them.
*  I used to know this dude that I used to do taekwondo with and he was an international shipment guy.
*  He would get things in other countries and bring them back to America and sell them.
*  And this is like pre-internet.
*  I used to deliver pizzas with this dude when he was trying to start his business.
*  But anyway, he could learn languages.
*  He just had a unique ability to learn languages.
*  And he was really into it.
*  And he would recite things from these languages to you.
*  I'm like, damn dude, that's impressive as fuck.
*  He just kept learning.
*  He was really into learning languages.
*  And then he'd buy and sell things from other countries.
*  And he could talk to these people on the phone in different languages.
*  Yeah, well I think it's like having a musical skill.
*  I think you hear things, like you are just able to translate it better.
*  One of my best friends growing up, he speaks like five languages.
*  I'm like, I can't.
*  I think you just have to be predispositioned to be good at that.
*  You think so?
*  Is that what it is or is it just you just have to love it?
*  I think it's a combo of like you have to love it, you have to practice it.
*  But I do think certain people have like the gift to do it more than others.
*  I wonder how many kids become really good singers as adults
*  because they get encouraged to do it as children.
*  And they develop their vocal cords and their ability to project while they're growing.
*  I wonder if it's the same thing.
*  So they train it?
*  Yeah, it's the same thing as like there's certain physical skills like martial arts in particular.
*  Where they think that the very, very elite cream of the crop, they start really young.
*  And guys like Floyd Mayweather started boxing really, really young.
*  And he's pretty much regarded the best boxer ever.
*  And as he grew up, he grew up like his body was developing while he was boxing.
*  So it becomes almost like a part of who you are.
*  Your body and your skills become one in the same.
*  Yeah. And they think that when you're learning and you're like in your 30s,
*  like say if you were like a pretty athletic person, you're learning in your 30s,
*  you're always going to have like a giant deficit when you're dealing with a guy like Floyd Mayweather.
*  Because he's just so clean. It's like in his bones.
*  It's in his DNA. Everything's clean and honed.
*  The pathways are so polished.
*  And he has so much understanding because he's been doing it his whole life.
*  It's like there's certain things you see, you almost like you can't catch up.
*  You can't catch up to certain things.
*  You have to, if you want to develop those skills to like the ultimate peak,
*  for some people it has to be done while they're growing and evolving.
*  It seems as if, and I was wondering if that was the case with voices too.
*  When little kids are singing when they're really young,
*  I wonder if those little kids develop amazing voices because they're like strengthening it as they're...
*  I would think so.
*  You would think so, right?
*  Like swimmers, they start young, gymnasts.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Everybody starts young.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe it would make sense that, I feel like there's a lot of energy involved in singing.
*  I can't sing, but I feel like there's a lot of projection and energy involved in that.
*  I would think that if you learn how to do that as you're young,
*  as your body's growing and developing, it'll...
*  I would think so.
*  I would think so.
*  Yeah. Because you can, you know, people get classically trained.
*  They get all these different trainings.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you started younger, it does seem like you would be at such an advantage.
*  I wonder if that's the case with talking shit too.
*  You got to learn young.
*  You know, if you don't learn how to talk shit when you're really young,
*  it becomes a real problem as you get older.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to learn.
*  You're like, oh.
*  Yeah. It's hard to learn how to talk shit when you're in your 30s and 40s.
*  You at least have to have siblings.
*  I feel like people with siblings are good at talking shit.
*  Or good friends.
*  Right.
*  Good friends that can shit on you.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, good friends that can say ridiculous things.
*  You need friends that shit on you.
*  It's not a bad thing to have.
*  Yeah.
*  If it's funny, it's got to, you know...
*  Keep you on your toes.
*  That's fucking good for you. It's good for everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, we're funny. People are funny.
*  Well, I think that's what made me have a thicker skin.
*  I have two older brothers.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So you're just like from day one, you're a piece of shit.
*  But they love you, but they taught you in a different...
*  You're not coddled, you know, with brothers.
*  They're just like toughen up.
*  Yeah, it's a totally different kind of relationship.
*  They know you. They know the everyday you.
*  You know?
*  It's...
*  You always find that really tough people, the really toughest people,
*  a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot of them,
*  they have older brothers that used to beat their asses.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Some of the best fighters in the UFC have older brothers.
*  Oh, sure.
*  Like, I don't fight, because why would I fight?
*  But if I had to, like, protect myself,
*  I know that old school fighting with my brothers would just come out
*  and I would beat somebody up.
*  Because that instinct would come back, that fighter flight.
*  You're like, oh, my brother's about to beat the shit out of me.
*  I better toughen up and fight back.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they didn't care if you were a girl.
*  There was no, like, oh, you're a girl, you can't hit girls.
*  We'd be like... And I'd be an instigator, too.
*  I'd be like, come on, motherfucker.
*  I had such a potty mouth.
*  At, like, eight, I was like, that's all you got? Fuck you.
*  They're like, you're eight.
*  That's hilarious. You were like that at eight?
*  I think I had brothers, because I had brothers.
*  Wow. And how old were your brothers?
*  They, the oldest one's seven years older than me,
*  and the middle one's three years older than me.
*  Oh, my God. That's a lot.
*  Yeah, so like...
*  Three's a lot, seven's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's almost like you're... I'm like, are you my dad?
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, like, I had...
*  I remember I got sent to the principal's office in, like, second grade,
*  because I gave somebody a bird.
*  They're like, how did you learn to...
*  Where did that come from?
*  I'm like, my brother.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  That makes sense, that would lead you to comedy.
*  They turned into, like, really good guys,
*  but like, when they were young, I heard stories, like,
*  when they would walk past...
*  That was back when people would keep their doors open
*  in our little town.
*  Everyone would see my brothers coming and would shut their doors.
*  Like, they were like the rugrats of the neighborhoods.
*  I just learned to be, you know, a little feisty.
*  Do you think that helps you in comedy?
*  It certainly, certainly helps,
*  because you just, you know, we all eat shit at some point,
*  and you just go, all right, I eat shit.
*  Moving on.
*  That's the hardest thing for people to take, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Oftentimes.
*  Well, yeah, it's hard, because you're like,
*  it's just you and a microphone.
*  If you're bombing, you gotta sweat through it.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, it certainly helps with, like, you know,
*  social media that we talked about is brutal at times.
*  You just, you're like, ah, you know, it's not fun,
*  but you just kind of shrug it off and go, oh, well, and move on.
*  Yeah, but those bombings are so valuable.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  God damn, they're valuable.
*  Failures are so valuable.
*  Like, we look at them like they're really bad,
*  and it's terrible, but if you have energy,
*  failures are valuable, because, like, it makes you realize,
*  like, I got some correcting to do.
*  I gotta figure out what the fuck went wrong.
*  I gotta do better, and it re-energizes you.
*  Yeah, because if people were just laughing,
*  it's not making you get better at that thing.
*  Yeah, you gotta sweat it.
*  Sometimes you just sweat it.
*  And it sucks when you're in it, but it does make you,
*  you're like, oh, something's not working here.
*  Yeah, so I try to pretend that I just bombed every day.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially when I'm about to go on stage or writing.
*  I've thought about it that way, like,
*  I pretend like I'm doing a set right after I bombed.
*  You know that feeling?
*  You gotta get to work.
*  Right.
*  It's a weird thing we do.
*  And it doesn't get any less weird.
*  No.
*  You keep doing it 20, 30 years.
*  It's still weird. It's weird.
*  Well, I think that's why, with the stand-up's a great equalizer,
*  these huge comics can go, for their audiences, go kill, kill, kill.
*  But then they gotta go back to the comedy club,
*  and with that new stuff, and start from square one,
*  and work it back up.
*  So it doesn't matter how big you are,
*  everybody's gotta go back to the club at some point.
*  And that's the beauty of it.
*  It really is. That's the beauty of this era.
*  We've been talking about that a lot lately,
*  because it's such an important point.
*  You become a beginner again.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you have new shit.
*  Yeah, and you don't know if it works.
*  And I was hanging out with Tommy this weekend.
*  Tom Segura was in Vegas.
*  He just happened to be there doing stand-up the same weekend.
*  I'm there for the UFC.
*  So he came to the fights, and I came to see his show.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  And his show, he's got, you know, his special's just about to come out,
*  and he's got all this new shit that he's been working out at the clubs,
*  and all this.
*  It's so fun to see that stage where someone's putting it together.
*  You know, they got these big laughs,
*  and then he's got this part where they're trying to figure out where this goes,
*  and then you can see how much of his is new, and how much of his is polished.
*  Where he's going with it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, with someone like Tom who's so seasoned,
*  do you look at stuff and ever be like, hey, I have a suggestion?
*  Or do you kind of just, you know, do you ever?
*  If I really sauce?
*  I mean, we talk about stuff, and he'll give me one too.
*  He'll tell me, you know, I like it when you did it this way.
*  First show you did it this way.
*  We definitely do that to each other.
*  Yeah, that's nice.
*  Especially if you see something glaringly.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like we ask each other to like Bert and I were talking about a new bit
*  that he had where he did it one way during the first show,
*  and he missed the part of why it got such a big laugh.
*  And we were explaining it.
*  I was like, this is how, because I watched both sets,
*  I was like, this is how I saw the first one.
*  But this is how I saw the second one.
*  You were implying something that's more funny.
*  Right.
*  And he was like, oh, right.
*  Yeah.
*  OK, so that, yeah.
*  So I need more of a pause there.
*  I was like, exactly.
*  Right.
*  Otherwise, it seems like it's part of the sentence before.
*  Yeah.
*  I love that.
*  I love getting that feedback.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, it's great getting it too.
*  You know, some good comics have given me really good advice.
*  It's cool when you see it through somebody else's eyes.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Because, yeah, there's so many things you miss.
*  Yeah, because Bert was doing that with me.
*  He was like, oh, you said this thing.
*  You got to go back to that thing and explore it.
*  Right.
*  Did you record all your sets?
*  Half of them.
*  I need to get better about that.
*  Sometimes I forget.
*  I just.
*  I listen to half of them.
*  Yeah.
*  So we're even.
*  I record all of them.
*  I listen to half of them.
*  That's how I learned how to do it.
*  I feel like if I learn that way, it seems to me that when I'm doing it, it's just.
*  It's always just trying to do your best.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And for me, part of doing my best, I have to hear it.
*  I got to listen to it.
*  Yeah.
*  And if I felt like something went weird or something was clunky or I tried to do something
*  backwards, I try to do the punchline first and she's just fucking around with a bit,
*  trying to expand on it.
*  I need to hear it.
*  Yeah.
*  I need to hear it.
*  I need to hear it.
*  And I mean, you can hear it.
*  You know, if it worked like here clunky.
*  Yeah.
*  You can especially when shit's new.
*  It's like, oh, this is clunky.
*  Yeah.
*  This entrance is clunky.
*  I don't know how to get there.
*  I got to make a line.
*  It's such a science, right?
*  It is kind of, but it's also like, like what's great about Joey Diaz is that it's an art.
*  Right.
*  There's no science to him.
*  Right.
*  It's feel.
*  A plus B doesn't equal C.
*  Yeah, it's feel.
*  It's just he knows what's funny.
*  Right.
*  It's, you know, but he's like that all the time.
*  Like, listen, fortune, cut the shit.
*  Let's cut the shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Just cut the shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's got a lot of opinions and they're funny.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I just start with what's funny to me and then expand from there and hope that
*  other people find it funny.
*  If they don't, you jump ship, try a new bit.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you're doing it, you're doing it for a specific reason, right?
*  You're doing it because you're trying to figure out how to make it work.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  It's a little, little science project you're doing.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  Well, cause you know that certain stories from your life or family or whatever are funny.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes like we were like, but how do I get that across?
*  In it not be a, you had to be there moment.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Like how do you make the audience be there?
*  That's the part for me that's always like what I'm aiming for.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want them to go away going, oh, I guess you had to be there to find that funny.
*  I want them to be like, oh, I felt like I was in that moment with you watching it happen.
*  I like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's just a really good joke, right?
*  I always say that most jokes that you see recorded, it's probably 70% as funny as it
*  was if you were there.
*  Right.
*  Do you feel like that's accurate?
*  For sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause there's a feeling that you get when you're laughing with people.
*  There's a communal feeling to it.
*  It's fun about being in the audience.
*  Yeah.
*  It brings it out of you too.
*  That's fun.
*  It's fucking fun.
*  It's fun.
*  Part of the fun of what we do is the fact that we do it in front of an audience.
*  Everybody's jazzing the awful experience.
*  Everybody's having a good time.
*  And the audience can control so much of the mood of the show.
*  Yes.
*  You know?
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  You're watching it at home, rather.
*  You're just getting a ghost.
*  You're getting a ghost of that night.
*  You're right.
*  You're not getting the full juice.
*  A simulation.
*  So you think someone's funny.
*  What I'm saying is if someone thinks you're funny from Netflix, and I'm sure they will,
*  you're more funny.
*  Right.
*  On top of that.
*  You're more funny on top of that in real life.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just.
*  Cause there's a magic.
*  There's a magic.
*  With a lot of people.
*  You know?
*  You watch them live.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's one of the cool things about what we do is that it has to be done live.
*  And then it has to, it has to learn.
*  You have to learn how to do it live.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to practice it live.
*  People know what's going on now though.
*  You know?
*  They know you're doing that.
*  Before, like, when people would come to see you, they wanted every bit to be, you know,
*  polished and done and ready.
*  But now they know that if you come to the Tuesday night to the comedy store, there's going to
*  be some clunky premises tossed about.
*  You're like, you paid $15 for this ticket.
*  This is what you're getting.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes, there's, I sometimes, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
*  I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm

*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
