**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c)

*  Good to see you brother. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=15.0s)]
*  Glad to be back. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=16.0s)]
*  Can I pluck my dates real quick before I forget? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=19.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to be in Denver at Comedy Works on July 13th through the 15th in Liberty [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=20.0s)]
*  Live in West Nyack, New York on July 20th through the 22nd. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=27.0s)]
*  Get those tickets on BrianSimpsonComedy.com. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=32.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=35.0s)]
*  Listen to the podcast, BS with Brian Simpson. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=36.0s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very good. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=38.0s)]
*  You enjoy doing it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=39.0s)]
*  I love it man. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=40.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=41.0s)]
*  I feel like you need something outside of comedy, like when you start doing it for money, you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=42.0s)]
*  know you have to do something else so you're not just doing comedy, you know? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, it also helps your brain just because you're talking about stuff and thinking about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=50.0s)]
*  stuff. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=55.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=56.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=57.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=58.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm getting better at it too. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=60.0s)]
*  Just having to find your own energy every week or whatever. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=61.0s)]
*  I just like having something to do. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's great. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=64.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=66.0s)]
*  I think the best tool for comics is the one person podcast, which you do too. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=67.0s)]
*  It's like where one person gets to rant about things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=72.0s)]
*  You have guests on but sometimes you just rant about things. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=74.0s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=77.0s)]
*  I think that is like where Burr comes up with a lot of his material. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=78.0s)]
*  That's where Tim Dillon comes up with a lot of his material. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=81.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=84.0s)]
*  He's got his extra superpower. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=85.0s)]
*  I get a lot of mine from regret. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=86.0s)]
*  Like I'll say something because what I do is I have my producer find these articles [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=87.0s)]
*  and I've never read them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=91.52s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=93.0s)]
*  And he gives me the gist of it and I just react. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=94.0s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, oh, why did you say that? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=96.0s)]
*  When I heard about the submarine people, the first thing I said was, what kind of stupid? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=99.0s)]
*  But I forget, I got empathy for the people still. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=103.0s)]
*  I do too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=106.0s)]
*  They're dumb as fuck but being trapped in a box is one of the worst ways to go. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=107.0s)]
*  They haven't found them yet but they're hearing banging now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=116.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean they have 30 hours, less than 30 hours now just before they run out of air. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're dead. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=125.0s)]
*  I think they're already gone. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=127.0s)]
*  Well, if there's banging, if someone's banging. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=129.0s)]
*  As of Tuesday afternoon they had 40 to 41 hours. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=131.0s)]
*  That was 24 hours ago now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=136.0s)]
*  As of recording. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=137.0s)]
*  So they got like 20 hours. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah, like everybody that's still alive is really sleepy right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=139.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=143.0s)]
*  5 or 6 a.m. Thursday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=145.0s)]
*  Eastern Standard Time is when they run out of breathable air. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=147.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Tomorrow morning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=150.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=152.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=154.0s)]
*  Well, that's if they're all still alive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=155.0s)]
*  True. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=157.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=158.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=159.0s)]
*  I think somebody on there might have made a heroic sacrifice or something. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=160.0s)]
*  What does that do for anybody? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=163.0s)]
*  It leaves the air for one person to breathe. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=165.0s)]
*  Do you think someone killed someone so they have more air? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=167.0s)]
*  I think somebody might have killed themselves so everybody else had more air. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=169.0s)]
*  How are you going to kill yourself in front of everybody on a little tiny submarine smaller than this room? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=172.0s)]
*  Just have somebody choke you out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=176.0s)]
*  You know how much energy it would take to choke someone out? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=180.0s)]
*  You'd rather just sit still. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=182.0s)]
*  One of them down there with their son. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=184.0s)]
*  Can you imagine being on there with your child? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=186.0s)]
*  You're like, baby, look, daddy showed you how to do, I showed you how to do the rear neck. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=188.0s)]
*  Finish me off. Live for the rest of us. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=194.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=196.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody's going to do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=198.0s)]
*  I think they're just going to assume they're all going to die together. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=203.0s)]
*  If they die together. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=204.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, I have no idea what ability they have to pull that thing up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=211.0s)]
*  Can you imagine what's on the cell phones? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=212.0s)]
*  Like these hours now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=216.0s)]
*  They still had hope yesterday probably. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=217.0s)]
*  But like right now, can you imagine? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=219.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=222.0s)]
*  Or being the guy that forgot your charger? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=223.0s)]
*  Well, the crazy thing is Jamie pointed this out yesterday and it's there's lawsuits apparently. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=225.0s)]
*  Did you point it out? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=231.0s)]
*  No, you didn't tell me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=232.0s)]
*  Someone told me in the green room. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=233.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=234.0s)]
*  It was you? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=235.0s)]
*  About the window? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=237.0s)]
*  Oh, that was you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=239.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=240.0s)]
*  So tell people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=242.0s)]
*  Someone yesterday I read that there was a lawsuit in 2018. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=243.0s)]
*  A whistleblower was trying to report that the window, the glass wasn't rated for that depth. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=256.0s)]
*  And they fired him apparently. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=257.0s)]
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, you sent it to me on Twitter. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=260.0s)]
*  Oh, you found it? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=261.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=262.0s)]
*  Ocean Gate was warned of potential for catastrophic problems with Titanic Mission. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=263.0s)]
*  In January 2018, the company's engineering team was about to hand over the craft, named [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=273.0s)]
*  Titan, to the crew who would be responsible for ensuring the safety of its future passengers. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=278.0s)]
*  But the experts inside and outside the company were beginning to sound alarms. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=282.0s)]
*  Ocean Gate's director of marine operations, David Lockridge, started working on a report [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=286.0s)]
*  around the time according to court documents, ultimately producing a scathing document to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=292.0s)]
*  which he said the craft needed more testing and stressed the potential dangers of the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=296.0s)]
*  two months later, Ocean Gate faced similar dire calls from more than three dozen people, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=300.0s)]
*  industry leaders, deep sea explorers, and oceanographers who warned in a letter to its [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=310.0s)]
*  chief executive Stockton Rush that the company's experimental approach and its decision to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=314.0s)]
*  forego a traditional assessment could lead to potentially catastrophic problems with [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=319.0s)]
*  the Titanic Mission. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=323.0s)]
*  So apparently they've done this a hundred times? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not enough. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah, they've done it a hundred times. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=330.0s)]
*  Imagine being number 99, and you hear about this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and I read too this morning, some reporter was on one, he was on the boat [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=336.0s)]
*  last year and it got lost for like five hours, the submersible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=342.0s)]
*  And he didn't say anything. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=346.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=348.0s)]
*  It says Mr. Lockridge reported learning that the viewport that lets the passengers see [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=349.0s)]
*  outside the craft was only certified to work at depths of up to 1,300 meters. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=354.0s)]
*  That is far less than would be necessary for trips to the Titanic, which is nearly 4,000 [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=360.0s)]
*  meters below the ocean surface. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=364.0s)]
*  The paying passengers would not be aware and would not be informed of this experimental [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=367.0s)]
*  design, lawyers for Mr. Lockridge wrote in court filings the meeting led Ocean Gate to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=371.0s)]
*  fire Mr. Lockridge. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=379.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=380.0s)]
*  According to court documents filed by both sides, Ocean Gate has said in court records [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=381.0s)]
*  that he was not an engineer, that he refused to accept information for the company's engineering [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=385.0s)]
*  team, and that the acoustic monitoring of the hull strength was better than the kind [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=390.0s)]
*  of testing that Mr. Lockridge felt necessary. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=394.0s)]
*  The company said in its lawsuit that it appeared Mr. Lockridge was trying to be fired. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=397.0s)]
*  Mr. Lockridge responded by alleging wrongful termination, legal battle ended in a settlement [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=402.0s)]
*  later in 2018. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=407.0s)]
*  So it seems like it was him but two dozen other people? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=408.0s)]
*  A separate warning came from... [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=412.0s)]
*  38 experts. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah, received the same year from 38 experts in the submersible craft industry. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=415.0s)]
*  All of them were members of the Manda Underwater Vehicles Committee of the Marine Technology [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=419.0s)]
*  Society, a 60-year-old industry group that promotes studies and teaches the public about [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=423.0s)]
*  ocean technology. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=428.0s)]
*  The experts wrote in their letter to Mr. Rush that they had unanimous concern about the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=429.0s)]
*  way the Titan was developed and about the planned missions to the Titanic wreckage. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=434.0s)]
*  Look at this shit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=439.0s)]
*  The letter said that Ocean Gate's marketing of the Titan had been at minimum misleading [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=441.0s)]
*  because it claimed that the submersible would meet or exceed the safety standards of a risk [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=444.0s)]
*  assessment company known as DNV even though the company had no plans to have the craft [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=448.0s)]
*  formally certified by the agency. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=453.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=455.0s)]
*  People are gross. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=456.0s)]
*  Money. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=457.0s)]
*  It's always money. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=458.0s)]
*  It's always money. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=459.0s)]
*  It's always money. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=460.0s)]
*  It's money and hubris. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=461.0s)]
*  It's money and hubris. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=463.0s)]
*  Man, it's weird because for some people, there's no such thing as enough money. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=469.0s)]
*  And I don't understand that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=470.0s)]
*  I don't understand it either. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=471.0s)]
*  If I go the rest of my life making the money I'm making right now, I'd be great. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=472.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got enough money. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=477.0s)]
*  It's like I got enough money where I don't make decisions based on that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=478.0s)]
*  You know what Brian Callan told me once? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=482.0s)]
*  It's a great quote. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=484.0s)]
*  He said, once you have enough money to go to a restaurant and not worry about what food [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=485.0s)]
*  costs, he goes, everything else is bullshit. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=488.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, just about that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=491.0s)]
*  You just go to dinner and not think about it, not worry. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=492.0s)]
*  What was that old saying? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=494.0s)]
*  It was like $70,000. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=495.0s)]
*  Once you pass $70,000, more money doesn't make you happy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=496.0s)]
*  I mean, that was years ago. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=499.0s)]
*  It's probably like 85 now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=500.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=501.0s)]
*  But it was like once you pass that, once you up around there where you can just buy a good [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=502.0s)]
*  meal and not think about it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=507.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I don't make decisions where that's the number one factor where it's like, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=508.0s)]
*  oh, you could make $10,000 and do a good job or you could make $100,000 and be trapped [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=512.0s)]
*  with $90,000 and betray your two closest friends. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=520.0s)]
*  It's like, I think I'll just take the 10. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=524.0s)]
*  I don't need $90,000. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=525.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=526.0s)]
*  But they don't think about the guilt that would come with the betrayal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=527.0s)]
*  Imagine bringing your son down there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=530.0s)]
*  Imagine the arrogance. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=533.0s)]
*  Oh, well, that guy, I think the guy with his son, is that the same guy that flew in Jeff [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=535.0s)]
*  Bezos' rocket ship? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=540.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=541.0s)]
*  This dude's a breast taker. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the guy that owns the whole. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=543.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=545.0s)]
*  I mean, he owns the ship, not the submersible company. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=546.0s)]
*  But. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=549.0s)]
*  Dude, that is so terrifying. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=550.0s)]
*  But didn't James Cameron do that? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=553.0s)]
*  Yeah, James Cameron went down there before he filmed Titanic. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=555.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=559.0s)]
*  But I don't think he. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=560.0s)]
*  I think he went solo. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=561.0s)]
*  But he didn't take all, but he was in control of the craft. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=562.0s)]
*  I don't think somebody was controlling it from somewhere else. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=564.0s)]
*  See if you have footage of that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=566.0s)]
*  James Cameron's a wild motherfucker. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=570.0s)]
*  He's a wild dude. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=571.0s)]
*  I mean, just to be him and decide to do that because you're filming the Titanic. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=572.0s)]
*  I think that was he was filming Avatar, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=577.0s)]
*  He was filming a documentary. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=580.0s)]
*  On the Titanic. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=582.0s)]
*  On, yeah, on like what it's like to even do. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=583.0s)]
*  Deep Sea Challenge is what was called. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=587.0s)]
*  3D trailer. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=589.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is wow. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=590.0s)]
*  And they went, I think they went to the bottom of the ocean. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=591.0s)]
*  How far is that? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=594.0s)]
*  There's another video I was pulling up. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=595.0s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=598.0s)]
*  Like it's an animation of how deep the ocean gets. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=603.0s)]
*  And it shows you how compared to a bunch of stuff on land, how and then like how far the minimum depths are, then the maximum depths. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=604.0s)]
*  So he went to the maximum like Mary on a Trash. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=610.0s)]
*  It's more than twice as far down as the Titanic is. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=612.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=616.0s)]
*  And now don't they think there's a deeper plot? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=617.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they found some other spots they think are deeper. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=619.0s)]
*  Challenger deep. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=621.0s)]
*  Why am I thinking about that? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=623.0s)]
*  They might have done this live, I think, too. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=624.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=626.0s)]
*  No, Challenger Deep is an area in the Mariana Trash. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=627.0s)]
*  I just imagine just relying on all that equipment to continue to work properly. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=630.0s)]
*  But it also looks like they maybe not. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=635.0s)]
*  Whereas this current submarine didn't have any sort of tethering to it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=638.0s)]
*  His did. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=642.0s)]
*  He might have, but I don't know. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=643.0s)]
*  Actually, I'm trying to see. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=645.0s)]
*  You know what was wild to me, though, is you know how one of the conspiracy about the moon landing is that they really got a Stanley Kubrick to film it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=646.0s)]
*  We have a fucking director here claiming that he went to the bottom of those and no one suspects that he made it all up. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=656.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=664.0s)]
*  Yeah, how we know he fucking really went down there? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=666.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=668.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=669.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=670.0s)]
*  How many people were there? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=671.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=672.0s)]
*  Who's the witness? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=673.0s)]
*  All we got is footage of him inside that thing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=674.0s)]
*  And that's from the 90s. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=676.0s)]
*  It was probably cheaper to fake it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=677.0s)]
*  No, that's new. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=679.0s)]
*  That's pretty new. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=680.0s)]
*  I think it's like 2010 or 11. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=681.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's less than 10 years old. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=682.0s)]
*  Oh, so he didn't do that for the Titanic? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=683.0s)]
*  No. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=685.0s)]
*  No, I think he did it for Avatar. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=686.0s)]
*  Because you know, Avatar 2, a lot of it is water. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=690.0s)]
*  Apparently, it's like one of the most expensive movies to film ever. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=691.0s)]
*  It was a great movie. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=693.0s)]
*  They just pushed the fuck. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=694.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, it was great. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=695.0s)]
*  The next three got pushed back. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=696.0s)]
*  The last one's coming out now in 2031. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=697.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=699.0s)]
*  And the main girl's like, I'll be like 50 when I shot this, the first one, and like I was 20 something. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=700.0s)]
*  Yeah, but all you're doing is making faces. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=706.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=708.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'll be all right. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=709.0s)]
*  But if you get like in a role like that, or you have to come back again and again and again, like it's a little bit of a velvet prison for a lot of those guys. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I imagine they want to do other stuff. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=723.0s)]
*  But it's also you want that security. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=724.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's why they, is that why they killed off Batman? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=726.0s)]
*  I mean, Iron Man in the Avengers? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=729.0s)]
*  Was Robert Downey Jr. like enough already? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=732.0s)]
*  No, they have a giant, giant, giant story plan that's going on. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=734.0s)]
*  That's way bigger. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=740.0s)]
*  They're on phase five now or something wild with that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=741.0s)]
*  They're allowed to do weird shit now because of the multiverse. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=744.0s)]
*  They can just go back in time and reset things. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=747.0s)]
*  That happened in DC, brought in the multiverse too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=749.0s)]
*  They've earned so much leeway from the fans. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=751.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=756.0s)]
*  A Marvel movie just has to be better than okay. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=757.0s)]
*  And people are like, right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=760.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=762.0s)]
*  Because those, the end, because we know at the end what's going to happen. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=763.0s)]
*  Because the people in the comics, they go way harder than they do in the, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=766.0s)]
*  like if HBO had bought the rights to Marvel, it would be some dark shit. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=771.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=776.0s)]
*  Yeah, in the comics, so did you watch any of the movies, the Marvel movies? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've watched a few of them, most of them. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=780.0s)]
*  In the movies, Thanos' motivation is he wants balance in the universe. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=783.0s)]
*  So he wants to find an invincible zone so he can snap away half the people [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=788.0s)]
*  so there's more resources for the people left. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=791.0s)]
*  That's a stupid fucking reason. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=793.0s)]
*  In the comics, what happened is from a little kid, Thanos was like, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=795.0s)]
*  he was a freak, like a mutant. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=800.0s)]
*  He looked like that and people treated him like shit. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=802.0s)]
*  His only friend was Mistress Death. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=804.0s)]
*  She would visit him. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=806.0s)]
*  Death was her realm. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=807.0s)]
*  She was in charge of all dead shit. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=808.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=810.0s)]
*  And something happened and she fucking hates him. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=811.0s)]
*  He's banned from her realm. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=813.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=816.0s)]
*  He's in love with her. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=817.0s)]
*  He's banned from her realm. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=819.0s)]
*  That's why he can't die. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=820.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=821.0s)]
*  And he's trying to impress her by sending her more souls [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=822.0s)]
*  so he wants to fill it so he can snap it away. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=825.0s)]
*  So the movie would have ended in a completely different way. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=828.0s)]
*  He ended up having like, he created a platform for her in a throne [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=831.0s)]
*  so she could watch when he snapped away the rest of the universe. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=836.0s)]
*  And all of the fucking Avengers and everybody showed up to fight this motherfucker. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=839.0s)]
*  It was an epic battle. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=843.0s)]
*  And what happened to his daughter, you know, the robot chick? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=845.0s)]
*  That betrayed him? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=848.0s)]
*  Her punishment was like, she was just stuck standing still. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=849.0s)]
*  I forget it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=853.0s)]
*  He did something horrible to her. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=854.0s)]
*  But she was just stuck like a slave standing still. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=855.0s)]
*  And every superhero in the universe is fighting this just Thanos [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=857.0s)]
*  trying to get that gauntlet off before he snaps, you know? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=861.0s)]
*  And the robot bitch who he... [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=864.0s)]
*  The last person he saw coming, she like used her last bit of willpower [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=869.0s)]
*  and snapped out of it for a second and snatched the glove off. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=873.0s)]
*  The comic books went hard, man. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=876.0s)]
*  I wonder why they took that plot line away because that's a great plot line. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=879.0s)]
*  He's in love with death. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=882.0s)]
*  Bro, there's this dude on YouTube called Comics Explained. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=884.0s)]
*  He's the biggest... [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=888.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't read any of that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=890.0s)]
*  He does these videos where he just walks you through the whole story. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=892.0s)]
*  You know, some of them four, five, six hours long, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=896.0s)]
*  he goes through the whole issues and tells you the whole shit [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=898.0s)]
*  so you don't have to... [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=900.0s)]
*  And I was like, I watch this motherfucker all the time. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=901.0s)]
*  He walked me through that whole shit. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=903.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is way better than the movies. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=904.0s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=906.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it would have just taken them longer. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=908.0s)]
*  Because they have to make the movies for people that don't read the comics. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=910.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=914.0s)]
*  So they can't always do everything that's in there. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=915.0s)]
*  That sounds better, though. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=917.0s)]
*  It's way better. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=919.0s)]
*  We're halfway through four now, I think, on here [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=920.0s)]
*  of everything they've made in order, the timeline. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=925.0s)]
*  And then they have all the stuff that's coming out. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=927.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff on the way, too. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=929.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's two new giant adventures, reward movies coming. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=930.0s)]
*  No, we're in phase five now. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=933.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're here. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=935.0s)]
*  We're like... [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=936.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy, though? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=937.0s)]
*  Oh, Blade? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=938.0s)]
*  There's a Blade coming out later this year. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=939.0s)]
*  Daredevil, I've seen X-Men. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=941.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's X-Men supposedly supposed to be coming out. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=943.0s)]
*  At some point, they're bringing them back into the fold. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=945.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=947.0s)]
*  Oh, Captain America New World Order? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=948.0s)]
*  They just got the rights to Hulk back, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=950.0s)]
*  so I'm expecting another Hulk movie to get announced. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=951.0s)]
*  But Mark Ruffalo's not going to be the Hulk again, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=953.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=955.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be a new Hulk. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=956.0s)]
*  Depends if they... [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=957.0s)]
*  I mean, Mark Ruffalo is busy being a political activist or something. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=959.0s)]
*  He could take the rights to his face and put somebody else in there. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=962.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=965.0s)]
*  Deepfaked Hulk. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=966.0s)]
*  He's out there like, Hulk, recycle. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=967.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=969.0s)]
*  They can kind of do anything with CGI now. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=970.0s)]
*  Bruce Willis gave up all the rights. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=973.0s)]
*  He sold all the rights to his voice, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=975.0s)]
*  because he has a thing that's called aphasia. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=977.0s)]
*  He's got a serious neurological condition, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=980.0s)]
*  something's really wrong with him. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=982.0s)]
*  And so he gave up the rights to AI using deepfakes of him [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=984.0s)]
*  for ads and for a bunch of other things. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=989.0s)]
*  He sold that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=991.0s)]
*  Wow, for how much? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=992.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=993.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=994.0s)]
*  I mean, that's worth it if you can't talk no more. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=995.0s)]
*  Well, if you know that it's over and you're never going to work again... [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=996.0s)]
*  Yeah, way to get the bag. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=999.0s)]
*  You're just trying to stay alive. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1000.0s)]
*  I mean, he's just trying to stay alive. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1002.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1005.0s)]
*  There was a video of him with his family. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1006.0s)]
*  I think they were celebrating a birthday, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1008.0s)]
*  and you could see him struggling. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1011.0s)]
*  It's so sad. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1014.0s)]
*  Just for clarity, I just looked up an article. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1016.0s)]
*  There's a report that he actually did not sell his rights. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1018.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1022.0s)]
*  But it's very confusing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1023.0s)]
*  It says, actor denied selling rights to AI company for Digital Twin. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1026.0s)]
*  But there was also articles that said he did it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1030.0s)]
*  Right, 100%. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1032.0s)]
*  I'm looking up, it says that he did it, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1034.0s)]
*  but there's one that's counter to that that says he did not. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1035.0s)]
*  And then the quote is something like, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1038.0s)]
*  the wording about rights is wrong, Bruce couldn't sell. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1040.0s)]
*  Anyone writes they are his by default. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1042.0s)]
*  Anyone who writes they are his by default. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1045.0s)]
*  The deepfake companies use artificial intelligence [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1048.0s)]
*  to create realistic simulations of famous figures. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1050.0s)]
*  A deepfake of Willis appeared in an advert [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1052.0s)]
*  for a Russian telecoms company last year. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1054.0s)]
*  In August 2021, Megafon launched an ad campaign with Bruce Willis [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1057.0s)]
*  and requested us to create a digital twin of the star. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1060.0s)]
*  Upon their request, our engineers processed a data set [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1063.0s)]
*  composed of 34,000 images of Bruce Willis [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1066.0s)]
*  and made his digital twin for this series of Megafon ads. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1069.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1073.0s)]
*  It says James Earl Jones did something similar. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1075.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, it makes sense. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1078.0s)]
*  Especially if you're an old dude and you're done. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1082.0s)]
*  You don't want to act anymore. Just sell your rights. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1085.0s)]
*  I mean, James Earl Jones will be making that Star Wars money [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1087.0s)]
*  until he die. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1089.0s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1090.0s)]
*  And way after. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1091.0s)]
*  They can just keep using his voice? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1092.0s)]
*  Just for his voice. Isn't that wild? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1093.0s)]
*  Man, I'm trying to get that bad. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1095.0s)]
*  The money you make when you don't have to do anything is, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1097.0s)]
*  you know, that's freedom right there. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1100.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1103.0s)]
*  Yeah, just passive income. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1104.0s)]
*  Just keeps floating in for you. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1106.0s)]
*  I was just talking about this with somebody else about this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1108.0s)]
*  I think there's people that dream of being rich, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1110.0s)]
*  but what they really want, the fantasy is really that they can do [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1114.0s)]
*  whatever they want. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1119.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1120.0s)]
*  They really dream of freedom. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1121.0s)]
*  They really dream of freedom. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1122.0s)]
*  But because we're in a capitalist society, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1124.0s)]
*  freedom is being rich. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1126.0s)]
*  They dream of stuff too though. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1128.0s)]
*  They dream of stuff. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1130.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1131.0s)]
*  Stuff. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1132.0s)]
*  Like if you don't have stuff, you want stuff. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1133.0s)]
*  Oh right, that's what I mean. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1135.0s)]
*  Being able to buy what you want to buy, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1136.0s)]
*  being able to do what you want to do. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1137.0s)]
*  But then there's like the Bezos-es of the world where it's like, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1138.0s)]
*  for them it's about dominating. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1141.0s)]
*  It's not about the amount of money. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1143.0s)]
*  But he seems to, like he resigned from the company, right? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1145.0s)]
*  Did he? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1149.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1150.0s)]
*  And he's not in the CFO anymore. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1151.0s)]
*  Did he? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1153.0s)]
*  And I think he's just bawling. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1154.0s)]
*  That's what I think he's doing. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1156.0s)]
*  He's just banging that super hot girlfriend of his [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1157.0s)]
*  and traveling around the world in the biggest yacht that no one's ever built. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1160.0s)]
*  He's doing all that anti-aging shit. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1163.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing ham. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1165.0s)]
*  Who's that one billionaire that I was telling you about? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1166.0s)]
*  He takes blood transfusions from his son. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yes, that guy's weird. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1170.0s)]
*  Man, but he does look younger. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1172.0s)]
*  He looks great. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1174.0s)]
*  But I mean, you probably could look that, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1175.0s)]
*  there's guys that look that good that are his age that just work out all the time. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1177.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I don't know, because he's doing so many things [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1180.0s)]
*  that I don't know what is he going overboard with. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1183.0s)]
*  Like he takes like 40 vitamins in the morning and 40 more in the afternoon. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1186.0s)]
*  He always sleeps at the same exact time no matter what. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1191.0s)]
*  That seems tedious. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1195.0s)]
*  I know, it's like I'd rather just die sooner. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1197.0s)]
*  You know, like I was telling you I had a headache last night [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1199.0s)]
*  because of all the shit that's going on in the club. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1201.0s)]
*  Nonsense. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1203.0s)]
*  There's nothing bad. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1204.0s)]
*  So then I had a hard time going to sleep, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1207.0s)]
*  and then I got up in the morning and I was foggy as shit, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1210.0s)]
*  got in the cold plunge. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1213.0s)]
*  Like I know I'm not at optimum today. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1215.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1217.0s)]
*  I know it, but you know, that's life. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1218.0s)]
*  That's life. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1220.0s)]
*  That is life. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1221.0s)]
*  Suck it up, bitch. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1222.0s)]
*  Like, is that him and his son? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1223.0s)]
*  So he looks to me like a normal fit 40-year-old guy. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1225.0s)]
*  No, but show a picture of him from like five years ago. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1229.0s)]
*  What, did he look bad? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1232.0s)]
*  He just didn't. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1233.0s)]
*  He looks better? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1234.0s)]
*  He looks worse, yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1235.0s)]
*  He looks better now. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1236.0s)]
*  Well, maybe back then he was working, too. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1237.0s)]
*  See, that's him right there. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1240.0s)]
*  See what the... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1241.0s)]
*  Is he working still? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1242.0s)]
*  Yeah, go back. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1244.0s)]
*  Oh, that's him? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1246.0s)]
*  Right, that's him right there. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1248.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1249.0s)]
*  Well, also it looks like he lost weight, he got fitter. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1250.0s)]
*  Yeah, he went golf. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1253.0s)]
*  Which makes you healthier. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1254.0s)]
*  He looks like more like a superhero than goth. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1255.0s)]
*  Like, what is that strap on his shoulder? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1257.0s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1259.0s)]
*  Is that a bulletproof vest? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1260.0s)]
*  Is that guy a superhero? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1261.0s)]
*  What is that outfit? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1262.0s)]
*  Imagine wearing that outfit. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1264.0s)]
*  If you showed up at the mothership with that outfit, everybody would be like, Brian Simpson, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1265.0s)]
*  what the fuck are you smoking? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1269.0s)]
*  Tony might rock that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1271.0s)]
*  Tony would rock that with a big belt buckle. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1272.0s)]
*  No, but I bet you it's probably something that lets a certain frequency of light to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1275.0s)]
*  his nipples that helps him retain vitamin D or some shit. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1280.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1283.0s)]
*  What is that stupid shirt, man? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1284.0s)]
*  That shirt's ridiculous. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1285.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's got them Zero shoes on. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1286.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1290.0s)]
*  Oh, he's doing all the face stuff, too. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1291.0s)]
*  See, that's another thing that they can do. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1293.0s)]
*  They do this face thing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1294.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, what happened to his face? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1295.0s)]
*  I think it just got cold. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1297.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a different guy. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1299.0s)]
*  He said, I tried. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1300.0s)]
*  He tried. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1301.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1302.0s)]
*  But what is he doing right there? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1303.0s)]
*  It says 45-year-old CEO to the right of that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1308.0s)]
*  So what is he doing? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1309.0s)]
*  Okay, so there's... [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1310.0s)]
*  The way Cummings does. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1311.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1312.0s)]
*  There's a thing that they do where they put these micro needles all over your face and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1313.0s)]
*  then they rub stem cells in your face. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1317.0s)]
*  I know a few people that have had that done. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1319.0s)]
*  Now imagine the son doing this from 18. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1321.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1324.0s)]
*  That might be a whole different thing. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1325.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he eats 2,000 calories a day. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1328.0s)]
*  But he's vegan. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1330.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1331.0s)]
*  That's a lot of vegetables. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1332.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1334.0s)]
*  But that's interesting that he would choose that route, the vegan route for longevity [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1335.0s)]
*  because there's a lot of nutritional pitfalls in that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1339.0s)]
*  Can you not make up for those? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1344.0s)]
*  You can. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1345.0s)]
*  Because like you said, he takes like 50, 60 vitamins. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1346.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's possible. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1348.0s)]
*  It's possible to do. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1349.0s)]
*  But the most nutrient-dense foods are red meat. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1351.0s)]
*  That's the most nutrient-dense foods. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1354.0s)]
*  There's just a lot of weird propaganda. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1356.0s)]
*  He might switch it up. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1358.0s)]
*  Well, who knows? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1359.0s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't look that good there though. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1360.0s)]
*  So that thing again... [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1362.0s)]
*  But it's like for a lot of people on vegan diets, it's hard to put mass on. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1364.0s)]
*  I mean, he looks okay. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1369.0s)]
*  But he looks like a normal 45-year-old guy that's fit. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1371.0s)]
*  And I think that's his dad too. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1374.0s)]
*  See that picture right there in the middle? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1375.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1377.0s)]
*  Him, his son, and his dad all did the transfusion thing. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1378.0s)]
*  I'm not sure I like that picture. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1380.0s)]
*  Him in the middle. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1382.0s)]
*  Like why were you looking at me like that? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1383.0s)]
*  Imagine if you go over to someone's house and the son and the dad and the little kid, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1385.0s)]
*  they're all posed like this. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1390.0s)]
*  Like come on. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1391.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1392.0s)]
*  If I went over to your house and you were there with two other dudes, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1394.0s)]
*  I'd be like, hey man, I'm going to leave. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1398.0s)]
*  We were embracing? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1400.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I want you guys to be happy. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1401.0s)]
*  The one on the right is not as bad as the one on the left. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1402.0s)]
*  No, the one on the right is normal. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1404.0s)]
*  Like Joe, this is how we stay younger, Joe. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1405.0s)]
*  It's cuddle puddles. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1407.0s)]
*  It looks like his dad's not listening. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1408.0s)]
*  Intergenerational cuddle puddles. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1410.0s)]
*  That bellpuckle is fucking straining. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1411.0s)]
*  Yeah, well he's definitely holding in his stomach. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1414.0s)]
*  Yeah, on top of that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1417.0s)]
*  Like that guy's not listening. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1419.0s)]
*  Isn't it funny? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1421.0s)]
*  Like the son is on this crazy health kick. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1422.0s)]
*  The dad looks like he's eating meatball subs. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1425.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1427.0s)]
*  Well I think he was estranged from the dad and the son until like recently. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1428.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1431.0s)]
*  And they got back together for the transfusion. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1432.0s)]
*  Oh man, that is so hard for people. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1434.0s)]
*  I've met people that like their kid won't talk to them. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1436.0s)]
*  Like oh my god. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1439.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1440.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1441.0s)]
*  And then I meet the opposite. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1442.0s)]
*  Like last night at the club there were two people that were just like a dad out with his son. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1443.0s)]
*  Well one was out with his son and one was out with his daughter. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1450.0s)]
*  I was like that's awesome. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1451.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1452.0s)]
*  If you're 50 and your 25 year old daughter wants to still hang out with you, you did pretty good. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1456.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1457.0s)]
*  No, it's beautiful. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1458.0s)]
*  Hanging out with your kids is awesome. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1459.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1460.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, all sorts of circumstances. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1461.0s)]
*  Divorce. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1463.0s)]
*  Parents turn. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1464.0s)]
*  Parents turn. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1465.0s)]
*  One kid against the other parent. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1466.0s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1468.0s)]
*  I've seen that shit happen. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1469.0s)]
*  That's like when you date manipulative, vindictive people and they do it to other people and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1471.0s)]
*  you don't think they're ever going to do it to you, guess what? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1476.0s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1479.0s)]
*  You're going to be other people if they don't like you anymore. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1480.0s)]
*  You know what though? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1482.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1483.0s)]
*  While sleeping, Johnson is hooked up to a machine that counts the number of nighttime [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1484.0s)]
*  erections. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1487.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1488.0s)]
*  This guy's going too hard with data. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1489.0s)]
*  He also takes daily measurements of his weight, body mass index, body fat, blood glucose [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1492.0s)]
*  levels and heart rate variations. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1497.0s)]
*  I mean, okay. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1499.0s)]
*  Maybe he has a lucky number. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1500.0s)]
*  He wakes up 13. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1503.0s)]
*  13 boners. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1504.0s)]
*  How many boners do you think you get in a night? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1505.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1506.0s)]
*  What's a good number? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1507.0s)]
*  I didn't know you got them at night. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1508.0s)]
*  I get them every now and then. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1509.0s)]
*  I go to pee and I got to like do the lean. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1510.0s)]
*  But why do you need to measure? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1512.0s)]
*  Is there a normal amount? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1513.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1515.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1516.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1517.0s)]
*  I don't want to know that much data. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1518.0s)]
*  I don't want to be worried about stuff like that. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1519.0s)]
*  There's so much data. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1520.0s)]
*  And then it's going to come out with like an apple cock ring that will measure for you. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1521.0s)]
*  Five. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1526.0s)]
*  Five nocturnal erections during an eight hour sleep cycle, typically, with each erection [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1527.0s)]
*  lasting about 25 minutes. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1532.0s)]
*  That's about one erection every 90 minutes. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1534.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1536.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1537.0s)]
*  But that's weird. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1538.0s)]
*  Like why is he measuring, I guess to find out what his testosterone levels are, but [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1539.0s)]
*  wouldn't you be able to do that with blood levels? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1542.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1545.0s)]
*  You can go crazy. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1546.0s)]
*  Like when I had that whoop thing, like if I looked at it, I mean, I still have it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1548.0s)]
*  I just haven't been wearing it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1552.0s)]
*  But if you look at it and it says you only got like 25% recovery, but you feel good, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1553.0s)]
*  you're like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1557.0s)]
*  How come I feel good? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1559.0s)]
*  You know, that was actually a sign that a lot of people had COVID because they would [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1561.0s)]
*  have an eight hour sleep and then wake up and be like 4% recovery. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1564.0s)]
*  Like what the fuck is going on? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1567.0s)]
*  Like the way you were breathing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1568.0s)]
*  Your body's struggling. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1569.0s)]
*  Your body's not doing so good. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1571.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1573.0s)]
*  I'm sometimes I still do the health tracking, but sometimes I want to. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1574.0s)]
*  I just listen to my body for the most part. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1578.0s)]
*  I mean, I do measure my heart rate and I do wear a heart rate strap when I do some of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1580.0s)]
*  my workouts. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1584.0s)]
*  But like yesterday, there's a couple of people in my family that are sick right now. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1585.0s)]
*  Not bad, but enough, you know, that it's like they're sick. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1590.0s)]
*  And I was working out yesterday. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1594.0s)]
*  I was like, boy, do I feel like a bitch. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1595.0s)]
*  Like I just wanted to stop. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1598.0s)]
*  But I felt strong enough to do it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1599.0s)]
*  But it was like this. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1602.0s)]
*  So I'm riding this line where I don't want to overstress myself and like tax my immune [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1603.0s)]
*  system, but I don't want to pussy out of my workout. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1608.0s)]
*  So I got to feel it along the way while I'm doing it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1610.0s)]
*  It's like I'm going through a dark room and I'm just feeling the walls by hand. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1613.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1618.0s)]
*  See, that's you got more discipline than me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1619.0s)]
*  I would just I would just give in. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1620.0s)]
*  Well, I have a particular type of mental illness. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1622.0s)]
*  Like I need to do physical things. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1625.0s)]
*  If I don't, my brain doesn't work that good. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1628.0s)]
*  It just it's like too confused. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1630.0s)]
*  It's riddled with extra energy and data that it doesn't need. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1632.0s)]
*  It concentrates on stupid shit. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1637.0s)]
*  It's not good for me. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1639.0s)]
*  For me, I need exertion. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1640.0s)]
*  But when I have exertion, I'm calm and friendly and nice and easy going. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1642.0s)]
*  And I'm compassionate. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1646.0s)]
*  And I think about other people like their problems before I reacted things. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1648.0s)]
*  But when I'm like amped up, like if I haven't worked out for three days, like I'm not good at decisions. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1652.0s)]
*  You know, because then you know, you want to say things like shut the fuck up. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1658.0s)]
*  But when you say shut the fuck up, nobody here shut the fuck up. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1662.0s)]
*  They get mad at you. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1665.0s)]
*  Like they don't think, oh, I should shut the fuck up. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1666.0s)]
*  Like it's the most ineffective thing to say unless you're really thinking about violence and you're letting someone know if you don't shut the fuck up, I'm going to put you in the hospital. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1668.0s)]
*  Unless it's that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1677.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1679.0s)]
*  Unless it's a warning. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1680.0s)]
*  We talked about respect the other day. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1681.0s)]
*  That should have saved your life in a whole bunch of situations. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1683.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1685.0s)]
*  Respect people. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1686.0s)]
*  If all else fails, just be respectful. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1687.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1689.0s)]
*  Always be respectful. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1690.0s)]
*  It's wild now because nowadays it's like it just seems like a lot of people are comfortable being disrespectful. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1691.0s)]
*  It's internet. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1697.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1698.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy, man. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1699.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1700.0s)]
*  It's that internet culture is like that way of communicating becomes a part of your system. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1701.0s)]
*  You're used to communicating like that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1706.0s)]
*  There's so many people that are so crazy on Twitter. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1708.0s)]
*  The way they talk to people. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1710.0s)]
*  Like I couldn't imagine talking to someone like that to their face just because it's so mean. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1712.0s)]
*  It's so shitty. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1716.0s)]
*  It's fighting words to some people. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1717.0s)]
*  It's also such a pussy move because you know the person's not there. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1718.0s)]
*  You're saying mean shit to them to hurt their feelings knowing that they're not there. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1722.0s)]
*  And then you keep checking for replies like a sick fuck. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1727.0s)]
*  Because on top of it, it's like everyone sees this. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1730.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1734.0s)]
*  It's more important for me to get in a good clap back than it is. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1735.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1738.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1739.0s)]
*  I had an old gym. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1740.0s)]
*  One of my gym teachers used to like whenever it got physical in physical education class, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1741.0s)]
*  like somebody wanted to fight or whatever, he would let us fight. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1747.0s)]
*  But he would take you in the closet where we put the mats. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1750.0s)]
*  And he would be like, well, y'all can fight in here in front of me. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1753.0s)]
*  But you just can't fight in front of everyone. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1756.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1758.0s)]
*  And 90% of the time people go in that closet and make up. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1761.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1762.0s)]
*  Because it's the wanting to save face that makes you not be able to let shit go. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1763.0s)]
*  It's also when you get in that closet, you realize it's real. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1768.0s)]
*  You start looking for a way out of this. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1771.0s)]
*  And I don't get anything out of it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1772.0s)]
*  No one sees it. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1773.0s)]
*  So now how do I benefit from beating you up? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1774.0s)]
*  We're going to go over to your sleeve here and tell people what happened. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1776.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1778.0s)]
*  No one's going to see it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1779.0s)]
*  And you know, it's also you're about to get your face punched in. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1784.0s)]
*  But that shit will backfire though too. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1785.0s)]
*  Because some people really want to scrap. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1786.0s)]
*  But you take them in there and it's a problem. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1789.0s)]
*  They're looking forward to it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1790.0s)]
*  I had Mike Perry on the podcast the other day. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1791.0s)]
*  He's a bare knuckle boxing guy that came over from the UFC. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1794.0s)]
*  That dude, like some people pretend to not give a fuck. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1797.0s)]
*  That dude doesn't give a fuck. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1800.0s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1802.0s)]
*  Better him than me. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1803.0s)]
*  Thank God there's people like that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1807.0s)]
*  There's people like that out there and they're so fucking entertaining to watch them fight. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1808.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1811.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1812.0s)]
*  As much as I made fun of it when it first came out, the slap league. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1813.0s)]
*  You like it? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1816.0s)]
*  I like the highlights. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1817.0s)]
*  I haven't watched the full match, but some of the people in there are characters, man. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1823.0s)]
*  If you're going to get slapped in the face for a living, it'll probably be a character. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1824.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1828.0s)]
*  It's designed for those clips. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1829.0s)]
*  I think Dana needs to spring off. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1831.0s)]
*  They need to have a separate champ for front hand and back hand slaps. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1834.0s)]
*  Ooh, back hand slap. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1839.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need a back hand slap champion. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1840.0s)]
*  If you back hand slap, you got to be dressed like a pimp. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1843.0s)]
*  You got to have some fly velvet suit on, something just beautiful and purple. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1846.0s)]
*  Instead of a belt, it's just a cape for the champ. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1853.0s)]
*  Yeah, a cape. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1855.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1856.0s)]
*  Yeah, and a crown maybe too. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1857.0s)]
*  Big old pimp crown. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1859.0s)]
*  And a chalice. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1861.0s)]
*  Big time. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1862.0s)]
*  Remember pimp sup hose down? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1863.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1864.0s)]
*  There was a while where they would never air shit like that today. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1865.0s)]
*  It's horrible exploitation. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1869.0s)]
*  And they were celebrating these guys. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1871.0s)]
*  HBO, listen, we got to give HBO their flowers. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1873.0s)]
*  They've made some of the most sensational TV since, I mean, from the time I was a kid. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1876.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1881.0s)]
*  Up to now. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1882.0s)]
*  They got some, they got more, they probably got, their batting average is higher than every other network for sure. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1883.0s)]
*  Their batting average is sensational. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1888.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1890.0s)]
*  So many good shows. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1891.0s)]
*  There's more good shows than bad shows on HBO. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1892.0s)]
*  Just Succession, which just ended. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1894.0s)]
*  Yeah, Succession was great. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1896.0s)]
*  Fucking great show. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1899.0s)]
*  Fucking great show. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1900.0s)]
*  And the ending, holy shit. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1901.0s)]
*  Man, you know what? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1903.0s)]
*  I clapped in my house. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1904.0s)]
*  I was like, thank you. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1905.0s)]
*  I feel different about the ending every time I think about it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1906.0s)]
*  Well, it's so, there's so much there. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1908.0s)]
*  You're so conflicted because there's no heroes. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1910.0s)]
*  There's no heroes. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1913.0s)]
*  They're all fucking losers. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1914.0s)]
*  And that's real. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1915.0s)]
*  That's the real corporate world. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1917.0s)]
*  Think about the fact that at the end of the day, losing was still them all being rich. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1919.0s)]
*  Billionaires. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1926.0s)]
*  Like unbelievably wealthy. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1927.0s)]
*  Unbelievably wealthy. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1928.0s)]
*  And they were so, because like I told you, people like that, it's not about the amount of money. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1929.0s)]
*  They wanted to be CEO. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1934.0s)]
*  They all did. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1936.0s)]
*  And none of them ended up being. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1937.0s)]
*  And what's the, you know, the whole art of war thing when it's like, never go beyond victory. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1939.0s)]
*  So when I first watched it, I was like, man, fuck Shiv. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1948.0s)]
*  She'd rather be under Tom, who betrayed her, than her brother being in charge. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1951.0s)]
*  But then I thought about it at the end. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1955.0s)]
*  And it's like, the brother fucked up. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1958.0s)]
*  And I don't know if this was intentional, but I think I like to think it is. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1960.0s)]
*  You never go beyond winning. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1964.0s)]
*  He had it won. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1967.0s)]
*  He had it sewed up. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1968.0s)]
*  And you stop. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1969.0s)]
*  You don't do too much. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1970.0s)]
*  And when he was, he wanted to gloat one last time in the room. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1971.0s)]
*  And remember, he excluded Shiv again. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1975.0s)]
*  He was like, me and my brother was able to bring it across the line. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1978.0s)]
*  That was her one thing. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1983.0s)]
*  Like stop excluding me. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1985.0s)]
*  I'm smarter than both of y'all. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1986.0s)]
*  And he, one last time, and that's when she got up and was like, I got to think about it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=1988.0s)]

*  But it's a thing like gambling addicts. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2028.0s)]
*  Like I was talking to my friend Sean about gambling addicts the other day. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2030.0s)]
*  Like growing up in pool halls, not growing up, but being in pool halls when I was younger, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2034.0s)]
*  it was my first exposure to real gambling addicts. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2039.0s)]
*  And it is a sickness that's different than anything that I ever thought it was. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2042.0s)]
*  It is just like crack. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2047.0s)]

*  It's all money is just gambling coupons. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2058.0s)]
*  Yeah, they love the risk of it. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2061.0s)]
*  They don't, it's not the winnings or the losings. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2062.0s)]
*  It's the fucking adrenaline rush. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2064.0s)]
*  And you're watching the game. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2066.0s)]

*  It's fucking great. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2072.0s)]
*  I can't watch it again. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2073.0s)]
*  It's so anxiety. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2074.0s)]
*  Because like I knew people like that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2075.0s)]

*  Blew everything. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2080.0s)]
*  I watched people blow tons of money. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2081.0s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2084.0s)]
*  In pool halls, man, it's like everyone's a junkie. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2085.0s)]
*  They're all junkies. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2089.0s)]
*  You got your players who are like, they just, they're addicted to playing and [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2090.0s)]
*  they're also addicted to winning and they're addicted to making scores. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2095.0s)]
*  But then you got the line people, the people that aren't even, they're not playing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2099.0s)]
*  They're fucking betting on the side. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2103.0s)]
*  Those are the big bets. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2105.0s)]
*  That's the big money. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2106.0s)]
*  Sometimes people are playing for $25,000, but there's $500,000 in the room. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2108.0s)]
*  These are like big money games in the Philippines. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2114.0s)]
*  Big money games and you know, like when they get, some guy will come over from Europe [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2118.0s)]
*  and match up with somebody. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2122.0s)]
*  They'll have these like three day tournaments where they're playing for $100,000. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2124.0s)]
*  But there's so much betting on the side. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2128.0s)]
*  But has anyone ever, I wonder if they just sit down and do the math and realize like [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2132.0s)]
*  you lose way more than you win. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the fucking action. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2138.0s)]
*  You think you win sometimes, you're going to keep winning. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2141.0s)]
*  You're going to win again. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2143.0s)]
*  I'm going to get them back. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2144.0s)]
*  I mean, that was Uncut Gems. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2145.0s)]
*  There's always like chasing after that money. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2146.0s)]
*  That's what they all do, man. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2148.0s)]
*  It's wild to watch because it was so scary to me. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2150.0s)]
*  I got, I was nervous about gambling on pool. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2154.0s)]
*  Like I would only gamble a certain amount. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2156.0s)]
*  You think it's easy to have a friend with a gambling problem or a drinking problem? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2158.0s)]
*  I know a lot of good people that have kicked drinking. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2165.0s)]
*  I know a lot of really good people that had drinking problems and now they're awesome. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2168.0s)]
*  Like look at David Tell. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2172.0s)]
*  He had a drinking problem and he kicked it and became, he was already one of the best [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2174.0s)]
*  comics alive when he was a drinking guy and then quit and got even better. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2179.0s)]

*  You want to escape and it's usually some pain that you're dealing with in your life. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2197.0s)]
*  Some childhood shit or some failure shit. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2202.0s)]
*  Some of you're avoiding. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2204.0s)]
*  Yeah, or it's a genetic thing. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2205.0s)]
*  Some people, they just have a genetic propensity to alcoholism. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2207.0s)]
*  It just runs through their whole family. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2210.0s)]
*  Dude, I just heard a friend of mine told me about a guy the other day where he has a drink, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2211.0s)]
*  he has a drinking problem, but he also is an alcoholic. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2217.0s)]

*  You got to recognize that shit is like your arch nemesis. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2234.0s)]
*  But there's a thing about addictions where it's like, even if you know it's bad for you, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2237.0s)]
*  you can't get pulled into it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2242.0s)]
*  It's hard to explain that to somebody that's never been addicted to anything, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2244.0s)]
*  or at least they think they haven't, but you know. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2247.0s)]

*  I'm a fan, Adrienne. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2321.0s)]
*  I don't know if she's here tonight. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2322.0s)]
*  She'll be here tomorrow. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2323.0s)]
*  She'll be here tonight. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2324.0s)]
*  But yeah, I got to meet her during the Moon Tower. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2325.0s)]
*  She came by. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2328.0s)]
*  The mothership is so dope. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2329.0s)]
*  How about Bottom of the Barrel? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2330.0s)]
*  See, I didn't talk about Bottom of the Barrel at the beginning of the show. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2334.0s)]
*  But it's so much fucking fun. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2335.0s)]
*  I look forward to it so much. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2337.0s)]
*  I was bummed out that I didn't get on stage the second one. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2339.0s)]
*  But you never know, man. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2342.0s)]
*  You never know. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2344.0s)]
*  Like, I've had two premises that I've gotten out of Bottom of the Barrel that became actual [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2345.0s)]
*  bits. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2349.0s)]
*  Yeah, every night. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2350.0s)]
*  And it's a different show every night. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2351.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2352.0s)]
*  It's so silly. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2353.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the crowds. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2354.0s)]
*  And now we're starting to get to the point where regular people are coming back and back. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2355.0s)]
*  Yeah, they come back. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2359.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like... [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2360.0s)]
*  It's always different. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2361.0s)]
*  It's always different. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2362.0s)]
*  It's always different. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2363.0s)]
*  And some of the suggestions are hilarious. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2364.0s)]
*  Yeah, I give out prizes if I get a good one. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2365.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2368.0s)]
*  That's all... [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2369.0s)]
*  The fly gun. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2370.0s)]
*  It's a gun called Bug Assault. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2371.0s)]
*  They sponsor our show. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2372.0s)]
*  And they give us... [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2373.0s)]
*  And the thing is, this is one of those places where they didn't offer to sponsor. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2374.0s)]
*  I got one, and I was like, everyone should have one of these. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2379.0s)]
*  Like, I would be their spokesperson if they paid me. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2384.0s)]
*  Because I don't know if I've ever told you this, but I have a real... [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2387.0s)]
*  My relationship with flies... [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2391.16s)]
*  When I was deployed, my first deployment to Iraq, it was when we didn't have shit going [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2392.16s)]
*  on. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2399.0s)]
*  We just came over the border. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2400.0s)]
*  And we just camped in this town called Numanaya. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2401.0s)]
*  And this had the most fertile soil I've ever seen. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2403.0s)]
*  It just looked nutrient. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2407.52s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2409.04s)]
*  But we would dig holes to shit in every day. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2410.72s)]
*  We didn't have any porta potties. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2414.02s)]
*  And whoever got in trouble had to bury the holes. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2417.32s)]
*  But anyway, these were the biggest, most numerous flies that I've ever seen in my life. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2420.24s)]
*  I learned that they hibernate. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2426.64s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2428.12s)]
*  That's probably not the scientific term. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2429.12s)]
*  But they sleep at night. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2431.34s)]
*  And to the point where I would wake up at the top, we had all our things, it would be [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2433.28s)]
*  completely covered in flies. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2437.24s)]
*  Like millions of flies. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2438.8799999999997s)]
*  And you could scrape them off. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2441.0s)]
*  They wouldn't move. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2442.2s)]
*  They wouldn't wake up. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2443.2s)]
*  And we did it every morning. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2444.2s)]
*  We killed them all. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  And every morning, it was full again. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  Imagine if you didn't kill them. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2448.4399999999996s)]
*  And there were so many flies. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2450.64s)]
*  And they were starving. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  Any chance of moisture. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2454.12s)]
*  So we would eat these MREs. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2455.4399999999996s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2457.64s)]
*  You ever had an MRE? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2458.64s)]
*  So everybody eats it out of the bag it comes in. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2460.56s)]
*  And so when you open that bag, you had about three seconds to get the food in your mouth. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2464.0s)]
*  Because it's like they would sense the moisture. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2469.2s)]
*  And even if you got the bag closed in time, they would pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2471.36s)]
*  Because all of you, just anything. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2474.2s)]
*  If you cried, they were on your tears. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2475.2s)]
*  They were just starving. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2476.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2477.96s)]
*  That's why I don't eat outside. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2479.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2482.04s)]
*  Like if there's too many women in the group, they always want to eat outside. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2483.04s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2485.04s)]
*  I'm not going to come. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2486.04s)]
*  Because I already know the cutest girl is going to go, we should get outside. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2487.04s)]
*  And I'm going to be pissed. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2491.44s)]
*  The first time a fly lands on my food, I hate this bitch. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2493.6s)]
*  You wanted to do this. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2497.04s)]
*  And so when I discovered a gun that could kill these motherfuckers, yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2499.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you know my wife took mine away? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2504.8399999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2507.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2508.64s)]
*  She's like the whole fucking house is going to be covered with salt. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2509.64s)]
*  You're going to leave the doors open just so you can kill more flies. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2512.4s)]
*  Did you get the pistol or the rifle? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2514.64s)]
*  You gave me a rifle. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2517.04s)]
*  Oh Joe, no, no, no. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2518.04s)]
*  The pistol? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2519.04s)]
*  We got to upgrade you tonight. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2520.04s)]
*  The pistol's different. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2521.04s)]
*  I told you she took the rifle. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2522.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to hide the pistol. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2523.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to seal carry. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2524.48s)]
*  The rifle's cool. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2525.48s)]
*  The rifle comes with an infrared sight. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2526.48s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2529.48s)]
*  It's accurate within I think four feet. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2530.48s)]
*  But you pump it. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2532.48s)]
*  And that's cool. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2533.48s)]
*  That'll knock a fly out of the sky. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2534.48s)]
*  But the pistol's called the Shredder. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2536.12s)]
*  Now the Shredder, okay, it comes with a CO2 cartridge. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2537.88s)]
*  And it's a revolver. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2544.64s)]
*  So it literally has little revolver things. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2546.32s)]
*  You rub it in salt, load it up. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2548.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2550.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, bugger, salt shredder. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2552.3599999999997s)]
*  And you can get a little holster for it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2553.3599999999997s)]
*  And bro, when I tell you, because now that thing, it'll rip a fly to pieces. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2556.3599999999997s)]
*  You hit a fly with that motherfucker and it's dead. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2560.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2562.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2563.9199999999996s)]
*  I need one of these. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2564.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, I got you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2565.9199999999996s)]
*  We have them at the club. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2566.9199999999996s)]
*  I get fucked up by mosquitoes in my yard because I'm out there doing archery. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2568.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'll do it during the day with shorts on because it's 95 fucking degrees out there. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2573.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm out there for two hours. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2578.0s)]
*  And I come inside and my ankles are just brutalized. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2580.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, they call them no-seals. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2582.08s)]
*  This is one made for cockroaches. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2584.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2586.08s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2588.08s)]
*  It's for big bugs. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2589.08s)]
*  Bro, it just blows them away. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2590.08s)]
*  Bang! [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2592.08s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2593.08s)]
*  Boom! [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2594.08s)]
*  Hey, are you shooting salt into your fucking food? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2595.08s)]
*  Well, if it's popcorn, that's fine. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2596.08s)]
*  This is just such a setup. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2598.08s)]
*  Oh, that guy got fucked up. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2599.08s)]

*  And you know what, dude, it was probably her fault. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2875.2400000000002s)]
*  My cat only acts up. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2878.2400000000002s)]
*  This is fucking hilarious. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2881.2400000000002s)]
*  That cat was like, shut the fuck up. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2886.2400000000002s)]
*  No warning. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  Just shut the fuck up. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  You should have fed them. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  My cat only acts up when I'm wrong. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2890.2400000000002s)]
*  She's never wrong. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, something's always wrong. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2892.72s)]
*  If she's acting up, it's either something's wrong health wise or I'm late feeding her [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2893.72s)]
*  or her litter box is dirt. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2899.72s)]
*  Like something. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2900.72s)]
*  There's always something I didn't do. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2901.72s)]
*  She never just starts acting a certain way. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2902.72s)]
*  So she probably was fucking something up. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2904.72s)]
*  Well, she's annoying. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2906.72s)]
*  That whole she her pronouns thing is annoying. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2907.72s)]
*  Watch the water bowl, bitch. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2909.72s)]
*  If you're annoying about that, you're probably annoying about other stuff. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2910.72s)]
*  The cat was like, she need to change my fucking water bowl. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2912.72s)]
*  The litter box thing is rough. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2917.72s)]
*  If you don't change litter boxes all the time, like people go to their house and it smells [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2919.2s)]
*  like piss. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2923.2s)]
*  It's like you don't all factory senses are interesting in that they detect change. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2924.2s)]
*  They don't detect static smell. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2930.2s)]
*  So like you get used to being like if you live in a town where that has a slaughterhouse, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2932.2s)]
*  you get used to that. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2937.2s)]
*  If you live in a town that's got like a lot of agricultural chemicals around that terrible [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2938.2s)]
*  smell. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2942.2s)]
*  Like my parents used to live in Pennsylvania and I used to drive to visit them through [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2943.2s)]
*  Jersey. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2946.2s)]
*  And when you go into Pennsylvania, when going to where they lived, there was a lot of like [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2947.68s)]
*  agriculture and the smell was so bad. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2952.4399999999996s)]
*  You rolled on the window like what the fuck? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2955.4399999999996s)]
*  These people live with that every day, but they don't notice it after a while. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2958.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2961.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2962.2799999999997s)]
*  So like that's the thing with people's houses. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2963.2799999999997s)]
*  When you go over there and they have a box of piss and like, hey, you got to get rid [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2964.2799999999997s)]
*  of this. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2968.2s)]
*  Like you have a box in your house. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2969.2s)]
*  The technology is so high now. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2970.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2972.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2973.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2976.16s)]
*  They got the automatic joints. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2977.16s)]
*  It's like it don't make sense. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2979.16s)]
*  It's a little drawer, drawer, change it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2981.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2983.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2984.16s)]
*  But then if you got an outdoor cat, like, you know, she shits outside somewhere. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2985.16s)]
*  I have no idea where she shits. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2987.56s)]
*  I have no idea where she shits at. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2989.8799999999997s)]
*  And I don't clean it up. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2991.9199999999996s)]
*  I think they bury it a little. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2992.9199999999996s)]
*  Do your roommates take care of her when you go out of town? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2994.6s)]
*  No. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2996.68s)]
*  No? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2997.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they watch out for her, but not anymore. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=2998.68s)]
*  The only time. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3000.3999999999996s)]
*  They leave food out for her? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3001.3999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3002.3999999999996s)]
*  I'll have Sam. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3003.3999999999996s)]
*  You know Sam, Derek's fiance, Sam? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3004.3999999999996s)]
*  She runs bottom of the barrel with me. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3006.12s)]
*  I would rather her do it. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3009.12s)]
*  You know, men don't. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3011.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3012.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3013.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  Because like they'll take care of her, but they won't do what I would do. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3015.2400000000002s)]
*  She'd do what I would do. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3016.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3017.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's like, but only if I'm going for more than a few days. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, if I'm doing like four days somewhere, then I'll have, I'll just have her go check [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3021.08s)]
*  on her a little bit. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  If you have a cat and you come back home after a couple of days, the cat's like, oh, look, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3025.7200000000003s)]
*  you're back. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3028.2000000000003s)]

*  She gets mad at you? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3030.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3031.76s)]
*  She's always upset. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3032.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3033.76s)]
*  What does she do? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3035.1200000000003s)]
*  She meow at you? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3036.1200000000003s)]
*  She got like abandonment issues. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3037.1200000000003s)]
*  So she always, whenever I leave for more than a day, she thinks I'm going to leave her. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3038.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3041.5600000000004s)]
*  I've had strays, stray dogs that were like that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3042.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3045.48s)]
*  They get so sad when you leave. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3046.48s)]
*  But man, the bitch fine. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3047.48s)]
*  She's just, she got two fountains. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3048.48s)]
*  She got a dad home. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3049.48s)]
*  She just doesn't know. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3050.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3051.48s)]
*  She doesn't need a lot. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3052.48s)]
*  Her food, the bowl is automatic. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3053.48s)]
*  The water fountains are automatic. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3054.48s)]
*  She got two of those. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3055.48s)]
*  The litter box is automatic. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3056.92s)]
*  That food can't be good. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3058.2400000000002s)]
*  That dry ass bullshit food. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3059.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3060.8s)]
*  I mean, I feed her wet food when I'm home. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3061.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3062.8s)]
*  But like I said, I couldn't trust anybody else to do it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3063.84s)]
*  I wonder if cats get mercury poisoning from like eating tuna and shit like that. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3066.44s)]
*  I think they... [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3071.32s)]
*  Is that an issue with cats? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3072.32s)]
*  I think their kidneys are all pretty fucking strong. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3074.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3076.52s)]
*  But I mean, mercury is, it's a heavy bettle poison. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3077.52s)]
*  Like I don't think it's good for any animal. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3080.32s)]
*  And they're not giving them sushi grade fish. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3082.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, a lot of those, that's true, but a lot of those tuna, they're riddled with it because [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3085.0800000000004s)]
*  the big fish are the ones that are eating the most little fish. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3089.52s)]
*  And a lot of the little fish are the ones that have the heavy metal poison. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3093.08s)]
*  They can get it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3095.08s)]
*  Oh, they can. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3096.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3097.08s)]
*  Animals do not show signs until several weeks after being poisoned by organic mercury. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3098.08s)]
*  Signs can include blindness, excitement, abnormal behavior and chewing, lack of coordination [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3102.16s)]
*  and convulsions. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3107.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3108.68s)]
*  Oh, convulsions. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3109.68s)]
*  Cats show hind leg rigidity, lack of coordination and tremors. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3110.68s)]
*  Neurologic signs may be irreversible. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3114.76s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3116.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's not common to cats, but it may be the first thing a veterinarian suspects. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3119.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's possible that mercury poisoning happens, but is not diagnosed. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3123.48s)]
*  Oh, may not be the first thing a veterinarian suspects. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3126.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3129.6400000000003s)]
*  I had a dog once, a puppy that I got, and it had distemper. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3130.6400000000003s)]
*  And you can't fix that in a puppy. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3136.2000000000003s)]
*  What is distemper? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3138.1200000000003s)]
*  Distemper is horrible. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3139.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it's, is it parvo or distemper? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3140.1200000000003s)]
*  Are they the same thing? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3143.0800000000004s)]
*  It's a horrible virus that puppies get, and he would just go into these terrible convulsions, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3145.5s)]
*  like these seizures. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3152.5s)]
*  It was so sad. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3153.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3154.9s)]
*  The cutest little guy, and there's nothing they can do about it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3155.9s)]
*  There's nothing they can do about it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3159.54s)]
*  At the time, at least, it was 20 plus years. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3160.82s)]
*  Watching something cute dies difficult. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3162.9s)]
*  Oh, it was so horrible. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3164.3s)]
*  He was so adorable. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3165.3s)]
*  He was such a little sweetie. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3166.3s)]
*  It's not the same thing. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3168.9s)]
*  So distemper and parvo are not the same disease. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3170.34s)]
*  Both are highly contagious viral diseases that could cause serious symptoms and even [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3173.54s)]
*  death, especially for unvaccinated puppies and adult dogs. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3177.54s)]
*  Distemper hepatitis parainfluenza. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3183.18s)]
*  I got him from the pound, and he was a rescue puppy. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3184.82s)]
*  Sometimes they're around, who knows where they are before the pound gets him, and he [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3189.06s)]
*  was already infected. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3192.9s)]
*  So sad. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3194.7s)]
*  He was such a cute little guy. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3195.7s)]
*  Why'd you take him home if he was already going to die? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3197.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3199.5s)]
*  I didn't know until after I had him. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3200.5s)]
*  He started showing symptoms a while after we got him. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3202.5s)]
*  He was real young too. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3207.26s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3209.3s)]
*  Oh, that's tough. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3210.3s)]
*  He was so cute. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3211.3s)]
*  I haven't lost my pet yet. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3212.3s)]
*  I've had animals die on me, but they were never mine. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3215.02s)]
*  I don't know what I'd do if something happened to this. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3218.14s)]
*  I saw a dead deer on the side of the highway. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3219.74s)]
*  I got sad. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3221.74s)]
*  This is a deer out here dropping their fawns. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3222.74s)]
*  So you got these cute little baby deer that are running around. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3224.14s)]
*  We were walking the other day, and the mother deer ran away and left the fawn. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3228.8199999999997s)]
*  The fawn just lies down on the ground because they're so small they can't run yet. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3234.94s)]
*  The mother tries to distract you by running away so that you chase her. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3239.18s)]
*  Hopefully the fawn blends into the grass. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3244.1s)]
*  They don't have any defense mechanisms. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3248.18s)]
*  They're too small. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3249.62s)]
*  For the first, I don't know how many days, they really can't run away. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3251.3799999999997s)]
*  Now they can kind of run away. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3254.6s)]
*  Now I see the same little baby deer and now they're running around. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3255.98s)]
*  That's a bad plan from other deers. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3261.3s)]
*  It's a plan that ensures that there's going to be less deer because you can't have too [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3263.78s)]
*  many deer. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3269.26s)]
*  It can't be perfect where they come out running full speed. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3270.26s)]
*  Coyotes would never get them. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3275.14s)]
*  That's more planning than those submarine people. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3276.86s)]
*  That shit pisses me off the more I think about it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3280.54s)]
*  It scares the shit out of me. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3282.86s)]
*  It just seems like a horrific way to die. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3283.86s)]
*  How you don't have a plan B? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  You know what's so strange about that whole situation to me? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3287.6200000000003s)]
*  I was telling Jamie earlier. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3289.34s)]
*  They started out with four days worth of air, Jamie. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3294.5s)]
*  Someone thought if something goes wrong they're going to need extra oxygen. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3300.7400000000002s)]
*  The trip was less than a day, but they have four days worth of air. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3306.1400000000003s)]
*  Someone was thinking about what they might need in an emergency and they stopped right [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3309.22s)]
*  there. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3313.66s)]
*  They gave them extra air and then no other way to get out of a bad situation. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3314.66s)]
*  They can't control it from inside of it. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3317.7799999999997s)]
*  There's no emergency surface button. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3320.3199999999997s)]
*  There's no transponder. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3322.22s)]
*  They don't control it from inside of it? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3323.22s)]
*  No. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3325.14s)]
*  It's controlled from the ship. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3326.14s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3327.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3328.14s)]
*  The ship got to be directly above it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3329.14s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3331.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3332.14s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3333.14s)]
*  If that doesn't happen, if somehow they lose contact with the ship, the ship is not directly [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3334.14s)]
*  above it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3338.46s)]
*  That's it. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3339.82s)]
*  There's no plan B. What? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3340.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3342.5s)]
*  So is it like, is there a tide that moved them away from under the ship? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3343.5s)]
*  Like what the fuck happened? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3346.94s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3347.94s)]
*  Maybe somebody crashed. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3348.94s)]
*  Maybe, you know, maybe that window failed at a certain depth. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3349.94s)]
*  That's what I think happened. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3354.86s)]
*  I think the thing failed. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3355.86s)]
*  I think they're dead. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3357.38s)]
*  I think it imploded on them. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3358.38s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3360.46s)]
*  Because it seems like... [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3361.9s)]
*  What do you think the banging is? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3363.26s)]
*  I think the banging is just, it's banging up against something or maybe the banging [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3367.06s)]
*  is something else. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3370.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's the ship shaking. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3371.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, they've never measured the sounds around that area. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3372.98s)]
*  It's not like they can say that that banging is outside the norm. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3375.3s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3378.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the Titanic's down there. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3379.14s)]
*  It's probably still creaking and swinging and who knows what that banging is. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3380.2599999999998s)]
*  But I could be wrong. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3384.9s)]
*  That could be them banging. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3385.9s)]
*  Seems like a waste of energy. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3386.9s)]
*  Like nobody's going to hear you. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3388.46s)]
*  But if someone is hearing them. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3390.0s)]
*  Oh, like they're thinking, oh the sonar will hear them. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3391.2599999999998s)]
*  Well I guess that's what it's for. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3393.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3394.94s)]
*  They've heard it through a plane. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3396.1s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3398.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3399.34s)]
*  So there's a plane that detected the banging. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3400.34s)]
*  But it's still unconfirmed. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3402.02s)]
*  From what I was just reading. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3403.02s)]
*  Someone's claiming they heard that and then they're like... [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3405.58s)]
*  But at this point we know there's no hope of saving them. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3409.06s)]
*  Even if they're alive, like right now... [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3412.9s)]
*  How do they get them out? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3415.46s)]
*  How do they get them out? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3417.18s)]
*  Even if they... [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3418.18s)]
*  Do they have another one of those things? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3419.18s)]
*  Even if they were on the surface right now, like if they had risen to the surface somehow, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3420.18s)]
*  there is an emergency. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3423.78s)]
*  They still can't breathe. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3425.64s)]
*  They can't open it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3426.64s)]
*  They can't open it from the inside. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3427.64s)]
*  So they have to find them to save them. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3429.6s)]
*  And even if they found them right now, they've got to bring them to the surface slowly. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3433.44s)]
*  You know, they can't bring them up too fast. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3438.12s)]
*  So who even fucking knows, man? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3440.64s)]
*  I think it's... [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3442.44s)]
*  How long does it take to get them to the surface? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3443.44s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3445.56s)]
*  I think... [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3447.12s)]
*  But it's longer than you'd be comfortable with. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3448.12s)]
*  So I think... [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3451.68s)]
*  It's not about how much air they have left, right? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3453.08s)]
*  It's about do they have enough hours of air left that it would take them to raise them [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3455.04s)]
*  to the surface and open that hatch. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3459.92s)]
*  How do they even plan? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3463.56s)]
*  See if there's like some sort of a detailed strategy of retrieval. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3464.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm looking. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3468.32s)]
*  How could they possibly get it out? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3469.88s)]
*  What I've found so far is that during... [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3471.2s)]
*  They spoke with somebody else, one of the writers for The Simpsons or creators for The [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3475.36s)]
*  Simpsons or something, took this tour last year. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3478.72s)]
*  And they had problems on their trip. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3484.0s)]
*  Three times on the... [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3488.12s)]
*  Or it says communication was lost during all three of his dives, including that to the [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3489.64s)]
*  Titanic. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3494.0s)]
*  It's like when they were trying to do it for TV, they couldn't even find the Titanic or [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3495.0s)]
*  something. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3499.52s)]
*  The boat has to be near the sub so communication can happen. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3500.52s)]
*  And if they are not near each other, communication is just gone. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3506.7599999999998s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3511.08s)]
*  GPS doesn't work underwater, nor does radio. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3512.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3517.3199999999997s)]
*  And they don't have a line attached to it? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3520.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's like some... [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3522.44s)]
*  In theory, which is probably not correct, it could have resurfaced at some point and [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3525.04s)]
*  it's just floating somewhere and they can't get out. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3529.2799999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  They said there's seven different... [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3532.7599999999998s)]
*  Not backups, but there are seven different possibilities for it to resurface. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3535.04s)]
*  And they're like, well, if none of those happened, the other possibilities are that there was [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3539.36s)]
*  a leak, in which case there's no backup vessel. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3543.48s)]
*  You're kind of fucked. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3546.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3549.44s)]
*  Yeah, any kind of leak, any kind of opening at that depth is going to kill everybody. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3550.44s)]
*  It's so scary. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3555.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3556.36s)]
*  That's such a... [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3557.36s)]
*  Because it's so slow. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3558.36s)]
*  Like getting down there so slow and knowing that all that water is above you. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3559.7200000000003s)]
*  Miles. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3564.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, just a column of water sitting on top of you. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3565.6400000000003s)]
*  Two miles down, basically. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3569.2s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3571.44s)]
*  And then imagine you sitting there and thinking about the one motherfucker that was trying [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3572.44s)]
*  to tell you that window wasn't good. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3578.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3580.8s)]
*  Right, the guy who's sweating it, the CEO, who has the information. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3581.8s)]
*  Because we got to kill somebody to save air, we're killing him first. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3586.16s)]
*  I'm talking a group into it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3588.52s)]
*  Hey man, you know what, you had a good run. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3590.0s)]
*  Boy, everybody involved in that company is fucked. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3594.28s)]
*  Somebody's going to pay for that. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3598.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3599.2799999999997s)]
*  One of the guys is a billionaire. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3600.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, it depends on which political party makes it their issue. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  If the Republicans make it their issue, somebody's going to pay for that. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3604.68s)]
*  What is happening with that Sam Bankman freed guy? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3608.3199999999997s)]
*  I heard they dropped five of his charges. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3610.72s)]
*  Which is wild. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3613.04s)]
*  I wonder how that happens. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3615.08s)]
*  Which is wild. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3616.56s)]
*  They just quietly did that while they're telling us about aliens. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3617.56s)]
*  Yeah man, this is the end of the death of truth. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3620.04s)]
*  This is the age where you can't tell what's true, you can't tell who's who. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3624.56s)]
*  Who's being bribed, who's not, who has an agenda. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3628.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3631.52s)]
*  So now people are going based off, it's like what you're likely to believe is whatever [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3632.52s)]
*  you want to be true. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3637.4s)]
*  Did you see that James O'Keefe left Project Veritas? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3639.2000000000003s)]
*  He was the guy that does all those gotcha videos, investigative reporter videos. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3643.04s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3647.2400000000002s)]
*  Undercover videos. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3648.2400000000002s)]
*  He got a lot of them. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3649.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know what led him to leave Project Veritas, but he started his own group. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3652.0s)]
*  He was in his own group yesterday. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3656.84s)]
*  He got some guy from this corporation talking about how easy it is to bribe politicians. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3658.04s)]
*  So he's on a date. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3664.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, you sent me this Instagram thing. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3665.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3667.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3668.6800000000003s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3669.6800000000003s)]
*  Cause this guy, he's like, you know, you can get a Senator for like 10 grand. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3670.6800000000003s)]
*  Does he know he's being recorded? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3675.48s)]
*  It doesn't look like he does. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3678.4s)]
*  No, he's on a date. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3679.4s)]
*  At some point he says that, he's like, you might be an undercover reporter, but then [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3680.4s)]
*  he still keeps telling the girls. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3683.48s)]
*  Cause he's trying to be funny. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3685.2000000000003s)]
*  He's, find that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3687.44s)]
*  I think he's trying to impress a girl. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3689.88s)]
*  But that's what it always is. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3691.6800000000003s)]
*  Like a lot of them are these chatty gay guys and they get some cute gay guy to go on dates [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3692.6800000000003s)]
*  with them. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3696.76s)]
*  Yeah, but there's one part of the video where he's like at a job fair or something. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3697.76s)]
*  He's just talking. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3701.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so this is it. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  Play it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3704.32s)]
*  Oh, I mean, well, okay. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3705.32s)]
*  I don't know, but I suspect it's probably because it's easier to do things when people [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3706.32s)]
*  aren't thinking about it. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3712.84s)]
*  All of these financial institutions, they buy politicians. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3713.96s)]
*  You can take this big f**k ton of money and then you can start to buy people. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3716.1600000000003s)]
*  I work for a company called BlackRock. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3721.96s)]
*  Meet Serge Varley, a recruiter at BlackRock. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3724.96s)]
*  Let me tell you, it's not through who's the president. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3728.6400000000003s)]
*  It's who's controlling the wallet. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3731.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it says, let me tell you, it's not the president. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3734.6400000000003s)]

*  And who's that? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3739.7200000000003s)]
*  The hedge funds, BlackRock, the banks. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3740.7200000000003s)]
*  These guys run the world. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3742.6s)]
*  Also, what a f**king- [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3743.88s)]
*  Campaign financing, yep, you can buy your candidates. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3745.12s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3746.92s)]
*  Obviously, we have the system in place. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3747.92s)]
*  You got 10 grand, you can buy a senator. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3750.92s)]
*  500 grand. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3756.24s)]
*  Does, like, everybody do that? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3757.24s)]
*  Does BlackRock do that? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3760.24s)]
*  Everyone does what he's saying. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3762.88s)]
*  Doesn't matter who wins. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3763.88s)]
*  They're in my pocket at this point. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3764.88s)]
*  Here's Serge Varley. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3766.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3768.36s)]
*  What a loser. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3769.36s)]
*  Well, these people always, it's always single people on dates. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3770.9599999999996s)]
*  But who talks like this on a first date? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3775.48s)]
*  Guys do if they want to impress a girl. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3777.7999999999997s)]
*  Guys do if they want to let a girl know, like, hey, they're a f**king big mover shaker in [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3779.7999999999997s)]

*  It's like, oh my God, I want to be with the man who runs the world. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3788.0s)]
*  Government secrets don't impress women, do they? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3789.0s)]
*  Well, that's not really government secrets. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3790.9599999999996s)]
*  It's corporate secrets. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3792.9599999999996s)]
*  I guess you're right. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3793.9599999999996s)]
*  I think it's them using their influence and money to affect the political system. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3795.2s)]
*  But it's, you know, it's power. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3801.7200000000003s)]
*  And when a guy can talk about how much power he has to a girl on a date, it's probably [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3804.08s)]
*  very intoxicating. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3809.16s)]

*  What's that? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3815.0s)]
*  I Googled his name and when you clicked this, they removed it. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3816.0s)]
*  They removed it. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3820.28s)]
*  Yeah, of course they removed it. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3821.28s)]
*  I also don't know when it got added. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3822.28s)]
*  Yeah, but of course they removed it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3823.6000000000004s)]
*  They always do that whenever someone gets busted. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3825.6400000000003s)]
*  He definitely don't work for BlackRock no more. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3828.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, he's in trouble. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3829.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably dead. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3830.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably at the Clintons ranch, swinging from a tree with a shotgun wound [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3831.8s)]
*  in his a**hole. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3837.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3838.96s)]
*  He killed himself by shooting himself in the a**hole. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3839.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good for him. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3842.44s)]
*  But they'll just disavow him and none of the major media networks will cover that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3846.0400000000004s)]
*  That's where it gets interesting. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3850.7200000000003s)]
*  When something like this happens, whether it's a pharmaceutical company, he's done that with [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3852.88s)]
*  a lot of those people, like Pfizer. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3855.96s)]
*  He got this guy talking about engineering viruses and it never makes the news. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3858.16s)]
*  I'm going to try that on my next date. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3863.24s)]

*  She probably didn't even fuck him. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3886.6s)]
*  No, she didn't fuck him. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3888.2s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3889.6s)]
*  That's like, that's the whole thing. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3890.6s)]
*  She got free dinner. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3892.56s)]
*  She's trying to win. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3893.56s)]
*  Free dinner, a hot scoop, and then destroys your a**. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3894.56s)]
*  You get a couple of cocktails in someone like that, you know, and they don't think about [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3897.7999999999997s)]
*  what they're saying. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3902.84s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're giving up some serious global details. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3903.84s)]
*  But then won't that always be, I mean, that pretty much gives Black Rock a way out. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3908.2s)]
*  It's like, oh, he was just trying to get laid. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3912.3199999999997s)]

*  For sure. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3914.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3915.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3916.7999999999997s)]
*  He could totally be full of shit. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3917.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's literally what one of the guys said that they busted. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3918.7999999999997s)]
*  He goes, I'm an actual liar. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3920.3599999999997s)]

*  I'm trying to impress my date. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3923.2s)]
*  I'm lying. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3924.2s)]
*  The guy said that, like on the spot. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3925.2s)]
*  And maybe he was telling the truth. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3927.16s)]
*  You know, people definitely lie on dates and pretend they know more than they know. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3928.6s)]
*  She recorded him being like, yeah, I have a 12-inch dick. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3932.3199999999997s)]
*  People wouldn't be like, well, that must be true. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3934.64s)]
*  He said it on tape. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3936.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, true, right? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3939.0s)]
*  But it seems like what he was saying is based on personal experience. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3940.0s)]
*  But that shit's, I mean, but we already knew that was true. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3944.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3946.7200000000003s)]
*  He said he was a recruiter, so he's never done any of that stuff. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3947.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3950.32s)]
*  He just picks the people that do it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3951.32s)]
*  Also, if it only cost $10,000 to buy a senator, I feel like we should own them all. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3952.32s)]
*  You could own them all. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3957.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, at least for one election cycle. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3958.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3961.2400000000002s)]
*  I wonder how that works with political donations. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3962.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what Trump always said. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3964.0s)]
*  He donated to people to make things happen. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3965.68s)]
*  He donated to people for this. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3968.0s)]
*  He went to their weddings. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3969.4s)]
*  He donates to their charity, where they also happen to be an employee and with a salary. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3971.4s)]
*  Didn't he say he paid Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton to be at his wedding? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3976.68s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3982.0s)]
*  I think it was either his wedding or one of his kids' weddings. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3983.4s)]
*  I think you can pay people and they'll do an appearance. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3986.68s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3990.4s)]
*  That sounds like torture. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3991.8s)]
*  How wild is that, though? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3993.22s)]
*  Give me $250,000. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3995.84s)]
*  I'll show up at your wedding. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3996.84s)]
*  I mean, just to be there, that might be worth the trip. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=3997.84s)]
*  I think they're doing that all the time, so it adds up. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4001.56s)]
*  Knowing Donald Trump, he probably didn't have their meals covered. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4004.92s)]
*  He's like, well, I'll pay you to come and you read the contract. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4007.52s)]
*  It's not an open bar. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4009.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4010.52s)]
*  The bar, it costs money. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4011.52s)]
*  It's expensive. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4013.52s)]
*  What was the story with that? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4016.52s)]
*  Is that legit? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4017.52s)]
*  Did he say that? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4018.52s)]
*  He said that. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4019.52s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4022.52s)]
*  I was trying to find the video of it, but it's not coming up. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4024.12s)]
*  Their quote is written here. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4027.12s)]
*  It says, if you're to believe him. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4029.12s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4031.12s)]
*  With Hillary Clinton, I said, be at my wedding. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4032.12s)]
*  And she came to my wedding, Trump replied. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4034.12s)]
*  You know why? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4036.12s)]
*  She had no choice because I gave. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4037.12s)]
*  He added that he gave money to the Clinton Global Foundation without understanding how [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4039.12s)]
*  his funds would be used. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4043.12s)]
*  I didn't know the money would be used on private jets going all over the world, he said. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4045.12s)]
*  It was. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4049.12s)]
*  Clinton had a front row seat at Donald Trump's wedding, his third wedding in 2005. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4050.72s)]
*  The Clinton team didn't immediately respond to request for comment on whether the Clintons [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4054.72s)]
*  only attended Trump's wedding because he contributed to her Senate campaign. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4059.3199999999997s)]
*  They're all in cahoots. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4063.12s)]
*  Just give them some money. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4064.72s)]
*  Give some money. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4066.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they'll do anything. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4067.52s)]
*  And then they use it on private jets. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4068.52s)]
*  They'll do anything for money. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4069.52s)]
*  Isn't that crazy though? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4070.52s)]
*  They could just use it on private jets. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4071.52s)]
*  They just got like a private jet slush fund. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4072.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4075.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4076.72s)]
*  Like, that's why I don't feel bad for people. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4077.72s)]

*  again. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4084.12s)]
*  If you use it correctly, and they use it to the most. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4085.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4088.32s)]
*  Yeah, they make the loopholes. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4089.32s)]
*  So they use every single loophole to benefit them, to make sure they will never go broke [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4091.32s)]
*  and their kids will never go broke. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4095.52s)]
*  Especially bankers. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4097.12s)]

*  Oh, well this might have been because of that. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4147.54s)]
*  I think that's why he said, yeah, like his lawyer said two tiers of justice. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4149.94s)]

*  Like Julian Assange. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4185.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4193.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4196.780000000001s)]

*  That's Chelsea Manning now. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4198.780000000001s)]
*  Right, Chelsea Manning transitioned while in government custody for Treason. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4199.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4204.780000000001s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4205.780000000001s)]
*  No one ever talks about that. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4206.780000000001s)]
*  Or did it happen after? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4207.780000000001s)]
*  Because I thought, I thought when she initially got arrested, it was Bradley Manning. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4208.780000000001s)]
*  And while she was still in custody, it changed to Chelsea Manning. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4213.780000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4216.780000000001s)]
*  And I was like, because I'm like, because it's so different. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4217.780000000001s)]
*  Because it seems like you're getting mistreated, but also like if you can transition, they're [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4223.42s)]
*  treating you pretty nice. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4228.42s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4229.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4232.42s)]
*  Like in prison. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4233.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4234.42s)]
*  So I'm just always confused. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4235.42s)]
*  I mean, I wonder what the transition consists of. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4236.42s)]
*  I mean, someone can transition by just identifying as a woman now. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4239.219999999999s)]
*  You just start dressing like a woman and saying, you don't even, you can still keep your dick, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4243.38s)]
*  still keep your hormones. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4246.42s)]
*  I think most of them start taking hormones. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4247.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4249.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4250.78s)]
*  I don't know what the percentage is. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4251.78s)]
*  Because you can, I think, because women, I think you, listen, it transition into from [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4253.78s)]
*  a woman to a man would probably be easier. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4257.78s)]
*  But I think women can tell you're not one of them. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4261.34s)]
*  You got to take estrogen if you transition into a woman because you got to think like [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4264.0199999999995s)]
*  them. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4267.139999999999s)]
*  They can pick up on the vibe. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4268.139999999999s)]
*  I don't think you're not taking your estrogen. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4269.139999999999s)]
*  Like, what is this logic? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4272.139999999999s)]
*  Do you know what autogynephilia is? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4275.139999999999s)]
*  Autogynephilia? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4278.139999999999s)]
*  Autogynephilia. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  Autogynephilia. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4280.139999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to guess. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4281.5s)]
*  Auto means happening without, like, unconsciously. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4282.5s)]
*  Gyna is vaginas, right? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4286.820000000001s)]
*  Like gynecologist, I'm guessing. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4288.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4291.14s)]
*  Philia means love. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4292.14s)]
*  Oh, so it means somebody that automatically loves pussy? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4293.14s)]
*  No, autogynephilia is men have a sexual fetish where they're attracted to women, but they [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4299.14s)]
*  want to dress up like a woman. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4307.46s)]
*  Oh. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4309.06s)]
*  They want to dress up like a woman and fuck women. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  Autogynephilia is defined as a male's propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought of himself [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4313.14s)]
*  as a female. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4316.900000000001s)]
*  It's a paraphilia that is theorized to underline transvestism and some forms of male to female [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4317.900000000001s)]
*  transsexualism. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4327.22s)]
*  So, you used to be able to say this. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4328.22s)]
*  That was like a normal statement. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4331.02s)]
*  Now that is transphobic, which is really wild because it's been in the psychological literature [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4332.780000000001s)]
*  forever. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4338.740000000001s)]
*  It's like Rocky Horror Picture Show shit. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4340.42s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a kink. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4342.139999999999s)]
*  I got a homie like that. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4343.86s)]
*  He transitioned to a woman, but he fucks women. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4345.219999999999s)]
*  Like, he loves, he still loves women. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4347.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's autogynephilia. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4349.3s)]
*  So maybe it's like he loves women so much that he also wants to be a woman. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4350.3s)]
*  I think he just gets turned on by the idea of him being a woman. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4353.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4356.54s)]

*  It's this aggression that gets introduced to you. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4430.86s)]
*  And it hits every man at the worst possible time. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4433.74s)]
*  When your body's just getting coordinated, you don't know shit about life, and this is [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4436.58s)]
*  a drug that makes you want to fucking kill and dominate and win, and it's just the highest [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4440.46s)]
*  dose you're ever going to receive. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4444.98s)]
*  You take like 15 years for it to fucking wear off. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4447.98s)]
*  That's why they want people to join the Navy and the Army and the Marines when they're [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4452.259999999999s)]
*  17, 18 years old. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4455.58s)]
*  When they can whip you into a fervor with just a little speech. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4458.099999999999s)]
*  You fired up. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4462.299999999999s)]
*  You're ready to kill. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4463.299999999999s)]
*  You want to live forever? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4464.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4465.299999999999s)]
*  See, now I'm like, yeah, I do. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4466.299999999999s)]
*  I would have got on that sub when I was 19. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4469.299999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4472.46s)]
*  But now I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with y'all? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4473.46s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4475.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I probably did it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4476.339999999999s)]
*  I was young and stupid, and I didn't understand consequences, but I probably would have been [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4477.339999999999s)]
*  regretting it halfway down. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4481.34s)]
*  Not understanding consequences. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4482.820000000001s)]
*  That's the most horrific of consequences, and the whole world's watching, too. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4483.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4489.3s)]
*  Oh my God, that scares me. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4490.3s)]
*  The thing is, because they're all rich, it's a joke. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4493.34s)]
*  Sure, some people have empathy, but right away Twitter's like ... [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4497.3s)]
*  Yep. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4501.9800000000005s)]
*  They went right in on it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4502.9800000000005s)]
*  The memes are coming. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4503.9800000000005s)]
*  If you search right now on Twitter for the knocking sound, it's just beats. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4506.54s)]
*  It's just real hip hop songs. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4510.78s)]
*  People are like, I heard they were listening to this, and it's just Young Jeezy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4512.3s)]
*  Or it's like the New Killer Mike album. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4514.86s)]
*  I can't believe they got it down there. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4516.78s)]
*  It came out the same day. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4518.42s)]
*  What's that? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4519.42s)]
*  I heard a couple of farts. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4520.42s)]
*  It's like listening to a knock, and then just someone ripping ass. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4521.42s)]
*  The New Killer Mike album's a fucking amazing song. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4523.66s)]
*  It's very good. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4525.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4526.179999999999s)]
*  It's very good. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4527.179999999999s)]
*  David Lucas played it in the green room last night. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4528.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very good. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4529.58s)]
*  This is Mike in his bag right now. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4530.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's in his own right now. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4532.58s)]
*  I try to talk him into doing a podcast. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4534.94s)]
*  I hope he listens. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4536.46s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4537.46s)]
*  He would have an amazing podcast. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4538.46s)]
*  That'd be incredible. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4539.46s)]
*  He'd have the best podcasts out there. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4540.62s)]
*  When he gets to give public speeches about things, he's so good at that, man. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4543.62s)]
*  He's very articulate. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4549.46s)]
*  He's also empathetic and kind and wise. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4550.46s)]
*  He's very wise. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4554.3s)]
*  Because he practices something that I learned from doing comedy for real, and it's that [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4555.3s)]
*  people will say, if you ask somebody, is it okay to talk about this or whatever, people [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4562.46s)]
*  will say yes or no or whatever. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4566.06s)]
*  The way they respond to a joke, you breaking this shit down to where it's obvious that [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4567.86s)]
*  you've put a lot of thought into it is enough for most people to not have a negative reaction, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4575.42s)]
*  even if it's a controversial subject. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4581.86s)]
*  When he goes and gives speeches about controversial issues or he talks to a group of people that [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4584.62s)]
*  all disagree with him, he's so thoughtful that you can't not like him anyway, even [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4588.94s)]
*  if he's saying something that you totally don't agree with. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4595.5s)]
*  He understands how his words are being interpreted by the people that he's talking to. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4600.5s)]
*  He's very smooth and careful with how he does it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4605.18s)]
*  Yeah, meticulous too. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4609.54s)]
*  He'd be an awesome podcast. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4610.54s)]
*  He's a great guest. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4612.54s)]
*  He's always got great opinions about things. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4613.54s)]
*  That's all you need. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4616.74s)]
*  There's always room for more people like that. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4617.74s)]
*  I'm always trying to encourage interesting people to start podcasts. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4620.42s)]
*  It's such a great way to get stuff out there. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4624.42s)]
*  For me, I want to hear how different people think. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4627.5s)]
*  I'm always wondering, why do I think like this? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4631.66s)]
*  What's the genesis of it? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4635.02s)]
*  You know what I love about doing my podcast? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4636.02s)]
*  It's not hugely popular yet, but it lets me get all my thoughts out without the obligation [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4638.02s)]
*  to be funny. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4646.82s)]
*  Because sometimes you've got to get through all of the unfunny to find the funny. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4648.7s)]
*  You don't always have time to do that on stage. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4653.54s)]
*  It's nice to just ... It's like finding a gold nugget, but it's all covered in shit. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4656.7s)]
*  You've got to chip off and wash off. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4664.18s)]
*  Sometimes the nugget's buried so deep that I don't have time to do it on stage. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4667.42s)]
*  Normally, I would just be sitting there thinking those thoughts or saying them to myself. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4672.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, but when you're saying them out loud like that too, you're hashing them out and [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4675.9s)]
*  you're working it out in real time. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4680.06s)]
*  Tim's the best at that shit. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4682.7s)]
*  Tim Dillon is so funny off the cuff on those rants. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4684.34s)]
*  This motherfucker get started on a rant. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4687.38s)]
*  Oh my God, his rants are fucking incredible. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4688.94s)]
*  He's dystopian. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4692.58s)]
*  He's the best at ranting. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4693.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's the best. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4694.58s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4695.58s)]
*  It translates to a standup. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4696.58s)]
*  His standup got way better after he started doing his podcast. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4698.46s)]
*  It's a premise factory. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4703.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4704.94s)]
*  Another person that's been in the mothership, most of the people have come now. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4705.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, everybody's right there. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4709.139999999999s)]
*  Man, it's so awesome. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4712.62s)]
*  Tim talks a lot of shit, but he bought a second house here. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4714.62s)]
*  He can shut the fuck up. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4716.62s)]
*  He bought a house out here. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4718.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4720.62s)]
*  I try to explain to people what, because I would never tell somebody, hey, this is better [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4721.62s)]
*  than New York or better than that, because that's a stupid argument to have. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4727.1s)]
*  But I feel like you should go wherever you're going to benefit the most, wherever you have [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4731.14s)]
*  the most connections, wherever you're going to get the most stage time. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4737.14s)]
*  You get a lot of stage time out here. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4742.18s)]
*  Like, what was his name, Cam Patterson? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4744.18s)]
*  He moved out here from fucking Florida. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4746.18s)]
*  Listen, I saw this dude on the internet. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4749.18s)]
*  He had put a joke on Instagram that came up in my feed, and I liked it and followed him. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4754.18s)]
*  Follow me back. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4759.18s)]
*  A month and a half later, mothership opens. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4760.18s)]
*  I'm standing outside smoking on the second day, and he goes walking by me on the street. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4762.18s)]
*  He's like, hey, don't I know you? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4767.18s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4768.18s)]
*  I'm like, did you move here? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4769.18s)]
*  He's like, yeah. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4770.18s)]
*  I'm like, hey, come in on Monday to the open mic. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4771.700000000001s)]
*  He comes in, Adam loves him. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4774.700000000001s)]
*  He does bottom of the barrel the next day. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4776.5s)]
*  Adam's like, holy shit, Tony sees him. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4777.820000000001s)]
*  Tony's like, I love this motherfucker. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4779.62s)]
*  He's going to kill Tony, kill that shit. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4780.62s)]
*  He went on the Kill Tony anniversary show. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4783.62s)]
*  Yeah, he was on the anniversary show, and he's a door guy now. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4785.62s)]
*  It's like, his whole life just changed up. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4788.62s)]
*  Well, I love the door guy program. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4791.62s)]
*  It's basically an advanced version of what we had at the store, but genuinely dedicated [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4794.62s)]
*  to the development of a new town. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4800.179999999999s)]
*  The door guys get so much stage time. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4801.179999999999s)]
*  We were talking about that before we ever did this. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4803.179999999999s)]
*  When we were planning this out, we were hanging out in the Vulcan. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4805.78s)]
*  We all were in agreement. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4809.139999999999s)]
*  You got to have two nights of open mic nights. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4810.219999999999s)]
*  You got to have a lot of open mic. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4812.66s)]
*  Minimum. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4813.98s)]
*  Minimum. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4814.98s)]
*  That's how the store had it back in the day. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4815.98s)]
*  That's really the best way to do it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4817.82s)]
*  You can always have, like last time we did open mic night, Bill Burr is in town. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4819.7s)]
*  He went up. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4823.74s)]
*  A bunch of people go up. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4824.74s)]
*  It'll be pros after the amateurs. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4825.74s)]
*  I think a lot of clubs don't do, because open mic is not a money making night. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4829.06s)]
*  A lot of clubs, they see it as an afterthought, but it's like, you have to nurture the scene. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4834.26s)]
*  You're doing it for the greater good of the art form. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4839.740000000001s)]
*  The more people that do it, the better the people will be. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4843.06s)]
*  The better the people that are around you, the better you'll be. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4845.860000000001s)]
*  It's good for everybody. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4848.3s)]
*  If you're a comedy fan and you go in one day and you see some kid who's been doing comedy [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4851.3s)]
*  for two years, it's kind of funny. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4855.860000000001s)]
*  Then you come back six years later and they're fucking headlining. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4858.98s)]
*  They're beasts. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4862.299999999999s)]
*  You're like, wow, this is wild. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4863.299999999999s)]
*  This is wild. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4866.74s)]
*  It's beautiful to see, man. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4867.919999999999s)]
*  It's exciting. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4869.9s)]
*  It's an exciting time for stand up. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4870.9s)]
*  It's my favorite place. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4872.099999999999s)]
*  What we're doing out here is the best that we can do right here. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4873.94s)]
*  It doesn't mean that it's better than anywhere else. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4876.259999999999s)]
*  They're all great if you do it the right way, but you've got to do it the right way. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4878.98s)]
*  It's just another place where you can do it. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4882.7s)]
*  I don't think you have to like, there's a winner or a loser. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4886.14s)]
*  That's dumb. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4888.900000000001s)]
*  It does help that there's so many good comics here. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of good comics here. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4891.3s)]
*  There's a lot of stage time here. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4892.62s)]
*  There's decent money to be made here, even if you're not a famous comic, because all [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4895.14s)]
*  the spots pay pretty well. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4900.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the good thing that we do out here, is jack that up. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4904.46s)]
*  All that free shit, if your show don't pay, it's not going to last here. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4907.06s)]
*  My attitude's always been the same. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4912.14s)]
*  It's not like I'm above doing a free show, but if I find out you're making money and [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4913.54s)]
*  you're not paying the comics, then I'm not fucking with you. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4917.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4920.54s)]
*  They used to have those shows in LA where the one person putting on the show was making [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4921.54s)]
*  all the money. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4926.660000000001s)]
*  They were making thousands of dollars, and they'd give like $50 to this person. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4927.660000000001s)]
*  They'd give a couple hundred bucks out of thousands and thousands of dollars for a [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4930.38s)]
*  sold out show. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4934.54s)]
*  That person wasn't even the good comic. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4935.9400000000005s)]
*  People were coming to see all the other people, and the other people were just doing the show [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4937.9800000000005s)]
*  because it was convenient. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4940.74s)]
*  They were in town, yeah, I want to do a set, and they just wanted to do a set just to work [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4941.74s)]
*  out. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4945.82s)]
*  You think of the store as a place to just work out, and you realize, oh, somebody's [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4946.82s)]
*  massively profiting. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4949.46s)]
*  It's amazing, like 85% of the money. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4950.46s)]
*  It's kind of fucked up, but that doesn't have to be the case. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4954.54s)]
*  The way we're doing it is way better. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4959.84s)]
*  Where the comics feel appreciated, the reason why people are going there is for the comics, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4961.66s)]
*  so they make the money. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4965.9s)]
*  That's how it's supposed to be. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4968.26s)]
*  It's also good for everybody else. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4971.5s)]
*  It's good. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4973.0199999999995s)]
*  It's good for the club. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4974.0199999999995s)]
*  The club's got to understand what are you selling? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4975.0199999999995s)]
*  This is the argument that I had with the store when I got banned. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4977.82s)]
*  I was like, you have a box with a microphone in it. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4980.14s)]
*  If we don't go, you have nothing. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4982.46s)]
*  You're not selling the Comedy Store. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4984.74s)]
*  This Comedy Store is a great venue that has a lot of amazing history, but it's filled [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4986.34s)]
*  with us. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4991.34s)]
*  We're the comedians. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4992.58s)]
*  If a shithead like you is making decisions and supporting a fucking joke thief over [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4993.58s)]
*  the rest of the community, you know what the fuck is going on. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=4999.24s)]
*  All you have is a box. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5002.2s)]
*  Most of the institutions in comedy work that way, where the institution gets most of the [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5005.84s)]
*  money. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5010.36s)]
*  The problem is they get you when you're not a draw. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5013.679999999999s)]
*  They can say, oh, well, they're not here because of you. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5018.2s)]
*  You get used to getting underpaid and not asking more about the money and how you're [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5022.28s)]
*  compensated. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5028.0s)]
*  You just have all these memories. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5029.8s)]
*  It's the prestige. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5034.24s)]
*  The thing about the store was it was a great place to work on your act and then you'd make [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5035.24s)]
*  money going to other places. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5039.64s)]
*  That's how I always approached it. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5041.64s)]
*  I was approached as its home base. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5042.68s)]
*  I'm glad they make money because I want to support it. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5044.84s)]
*  It's the best club that's ever existed. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5047.88s)]
*  I don't think they should make nothing. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5049.36s)]
*  When you would find out how much money was on one of those bringer shows, those showcase [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5054.88s)]
*  shows, you feel violated. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5060.6s)]
*  You fuck me. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5063.96s)]
*  You know that that's not fair. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5066.400000000001s)]
*  You give someone $50 and you're making $6,000. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5068.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5071.8s)]
*  That's what happens when people are allowed to do shit like that. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5074.400000000001s)]
*  Generally the people that are doing it aren't artists. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5078.68s)]
*  It's just like a business person that's figured out this little loophole that the artists [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5081.28s)]
*  who are just not good at planning for shit, they're scatterbrained and impulsive. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5085.24s)]
*  Every kind of artist at every level. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5091.2s)]
*  The concept behind this is just to put all the power in the hands of the artists and [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5096.599999999999s)]
*  just do it right and create a real sense of community. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5101.28s)]
*  There's people that don't like that. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5105.32s)]
*  Who? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5107.36s)]
*  I think people that benefit from artists being ... [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5109.32s)]
*  You mean people that own other clubs. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5112.719999999999s)]
*  People that don't benefit from artists being empowered. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5116.2s)]
*  It's not even a power thing. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5118.36s)]
*  You need them too. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5122.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm happy that they make money. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5123.88s)]
*  I want everybody to make money. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5125.12s)]
*  The thing is they always held it over us. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5127.16s)]
*  You know what it is. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5129.12s)]
*  Making money gives you the ability to say no to other money. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5130.44s)]
*  What I find is people in show business a lot of times all their power is in the fact that [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5136.2s)]
*  you don't have anything. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5141.599999999999s)]

*  All I got to do is throw a little bit of money at you. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5143.599999999999s)]
*  You have to say yes because you living in LA. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5147.16s)]
*  You're trying to survive. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5149.16s)]
*  Your rent is $8,000 a month for an efficiency and you need money. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5150.16s)]
*  You're going to sign this shitty contract and I'm going to give you 10 grand and that's [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5156.08s)]
*  more money than you've ever had at once. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5159.04s)]
*  I'm buying the rights to your idea. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5161.84s)]
*  I'm going to turn around and make $10 million off it. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5163.76s)]
*  When you have security in your money you can say no to shit like that. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5170.16s)]
*  That sort of situation in Hollywood only really applies to big budget things now. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5174.88s)]
*  It's very hard to get people to sign off on something like that now. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5180.16s)]
*  A big budget thing is different. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5185.64s)]
*  If it's a movie or something like that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5187.88s)]

*  Why is that necessary? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5708.14s)]
*  I was thinking do this and go on stage, but I never did. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5710.660000000001s)]
*  But imagine that one, doing that one. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5713.18s)]
*  People, you go on stage, people are like, what drugs you want? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5714.900000000001s)]
*  That was one of the ... [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5717.38s)]
*  Smelling salts. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5718.38s)]
*  That was one of the worst things. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5719.38s)]
*  I've never ... I don't know if I've ever read something so quick. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5720.9400000000005s)]
*  Where is it, by the way? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5725.46s)]
*  Where'd you put it? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5726.46s)]
*  Oh, you have it, okay. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5727.46s)]
*  It's right here. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5728.46s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5729.46s)]
*  That shit, it burned my whole shit, like all up in my sinus. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5730.46s)]

*  Yeah, it's harsh. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5772.26s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck was wrong with me. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5774.46s)]
*  That bag fucked me up. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5777.34s)]
*  And then you were like, that's even stronger. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5778.34s)]
*  And I put it right here. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5780.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5781.54s)]
*  I was like, what the ... So the whole time I was suffering, I was feeling like an idiot. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5782.54s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5786.14s)]
*  Oh, I felt like an idiot too because I had done it before on the ones that were not as [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5787.14s)]
*  potent. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5790.780000000001s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5791.780000000001s)]
*  That is the most potent one by far. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5792.780000000001s)]
*  Easy. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5794.58s)]
*  That's so bad. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5795.58s)]
*  This other one I have is called Bread ... [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5796.58s)]
*  Get that shit away from me. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5797.58s)]
*  Bread Line. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5798.58s)]
*  That's worse? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5799.58s)]
*  No. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5800.58s)]
*  It was just the highest selling one on Amazon. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5801.58s)]
*  It says they use an advanced polymer to bring the strongest and longest lasting formulation [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5804.22s)]
*  yet. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5808.82s)]
*  Maybe it lasts longer because this one, after a while, it does die off. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5810.3s)]
*  This is made out of some weird material that ... [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5813.78s)]
*  We should probably store this in the garage. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5816.46s)]
*  I think it's bothering me just sitting here. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5818.34s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what that one smells like. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5820.54s)]
*  It's barely ever over. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5822.66s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5824.66s)]
*  No sir. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5825.66s)]
*  Oof. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5826.66s)]
*  You got me motherfuckers. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5827.66s)]
*  Do you smell it? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5828.66s)]
*  Do you smell that? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5829.66s)]
*  Like when you're holding the bottle? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5830.66s)]
*  Do you smell it? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5831.66s)]
*  No. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5832.66s)]
*  I'm not breathing. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5833.66s)]
*  Oh, you're hiding it. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5834.66s)]
*  Can you bring a bottle of water? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5835.66s)]
*  There's water right there in that metal cup. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5836.66s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5839.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5840.66s)]
*  Dude, what's wrong with us? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5841.66s)]
*  Terrible taste in alcohol. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5844.38s)]
*  That was so stupid. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5845.38s)]
*  So dumb. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5846.38s)]
*  Oh man, Joe. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5847.38s)]
*  I can't wait to get Theo back in here. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5849.22s)]
*  Open up a freshie. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5853.66s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5854.66s)]
*  You got to open up that bag. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5855.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's still in the room. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5857.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5860.5s)]
*  But it's crazy because the ones that we had before, there were like one tenth of that. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5863.42s)]
*  I threw my glasses. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5868.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5869.02s)]
*  I worried we were going to throw the smell in salts. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5870.02s)]
*  Well, no, the thing is I couldn't ... [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5872.66s)]
*  That's not happened. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5873.66s)]
*  Oh, you think that happened? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5874.66s)]
*  I thought you tossed it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5875.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5876.66s)]
*  I didn't see that happen with you because my eyes were burning. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5877.94s)]
*  I had to close my eyes. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5882.86s)]
*  I had my eyes closed shut and I heard you go, ah. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5883.86s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5886.66s)]
*  Man, what was wrong with me? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5888.66s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5890.0599999999995s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5891.0599999999995s)]
*  God damn. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5892.0599999999995s)]
*  It still hurts. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5893.0599999999995s)]
*  The inside of my nose still hurts. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5894.0599999999995s)]
*  It's probably like 50 times worse than the last one. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5897.139999999999s)]
*  The worst shit is when you hurt yourself and you can only blame yourself. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5899.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5904.099999999999s)]
*  No, you can blame me. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5905.099999999999s)]
*  I figure out that makes it so fucking strong that nobody else has. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5906.54s)]
*  I wonder how they stumbled across that. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5910.02s)]
*  Man, maybe this is the best advertisement for it. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5911.820000000001s)]
*  That's the strongest shit I've ever smelled, ever. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5914.860000000001s)]
*  But Jamie, this is the same one as the other one. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5916.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5919.740000000001s)]
*  So it's like the batches are different. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5920.740000000001s)]
*  It's like a weed edible. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5921.740000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you break it up and you put too much in the left one and the one on the right gets [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5925.5s)]
*  all the less. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5928.860000000001s)]
*  If they start mixing that shit with cocaine, people will quit cocaine overnight. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5929.860000000001s)]
*  I 100% thought that I was going to see blood in this tissue when I just blew my nose. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5932.42s)]
*  It still hurts. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5937.7s)]
*  It still hurts all up in my head. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5938.7s)]
*  Yeah, my eyes hurt. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5940.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5945.22s)]
*  Oh, it was horrible. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5946.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, I thought it was going to never end. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5947.22s)]
*  The inside of my nose is scorched. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5949.22s)]
*  You're not supposed to go that close. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5951.22s)]
*  You guys went closer than you're supposed to go. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5953.34s)]

*  Like six inches away maybe? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5955.820000000001s)]
*  Where did I go? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5956.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, where was all that information from 10 minutes ago? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5957.820000000001s)]
*  I got up in there. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5958.820000000001s)]

*  It's like six inches right here. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5963.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5965.78s)]

*  That sounds like cat to me. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5969.78s)]
*  That's like when they told us to stay six feet away from COVID. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5971.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5974.42s)]
*  It's like, that just sounded like a number that somebody just threw out there. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5975.42s)]
*  Yeah, that actually says 12 inches away. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5978.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5980.139999999999s)]
*  That's more like it. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5981.139999999999s)]
*  Because right here, right here fucking me up. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5982.139999999999s)]
*  We both got in there. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5983.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5984.139999999999s)]
*  We got in there. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5985.139999999999s)]
*  I was like an inch from my nose. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5986.139999999999s)]
*  Do not do more than a few times per day. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5987.139999999999s)]
*  Uh-oh, it's real. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5988.54s)]
*  I'm telling you, Joe, somebody's going to remix this episode and they're going to constantly [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5990.26s)]
*  be playing, you going to suck on it and then a sniff in these fucking... [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5994.5s)]
*  And it's going to turn into, they're going to put a beat to it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=5998.82s)]
*  One can only hope. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6003.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the fans are fucking crazy. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6004.14s)]
*  The internet's amazing. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6005.54s)]
*  The internet is so great. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6006.54s)]
*  Memes to me, that's some of my favorite laughs of the day. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6008.34s)]
*  It's ridiculous memes that people say. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6011.38s)]
*  It really is a brand new kind of version of comedy. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6013.42s)]
*  That is, it's very super culturally specific. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6017.7s)]
*  Most of the best memes of the time, you couldn't show somebody a meme. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6022.86s)]
*  You show somebody a meme in 10 years with no context and they just don't get it. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6027.06s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6031.54s)]
*  It's like the new version of a street joke. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6034.54s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6036.5s)]
*  And some of them did just get everywhere, like the dude with the big dick sitting on [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6037.5s)]
*  the side of the bed. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6041.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6042.06s)]
*  Because the pictures can be used for so many things. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6043.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, so many things. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6045.700000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6047.860000000001s)]
*  And there's some people out there that really be, you know, they're really good at making [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6048.860000000001s)]
*  a good meme. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6052.18s)]
*  Anytime someone gets fucked up, anytime something happens, someone falls down, someone does [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6053.18s)]
*  that meme of me with the microphone there. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6057.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6059.06s)]
*  And they don't get paid for it. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6060.06s)]
*  Wherever they come from, somebody always takes credit and they don't get paid. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6061.46s)]
*  Well there's all these pages that are just dedicated to memes and they just find them [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6065.14s)]
*  on Reddit or wherever they get them from and 4chan and they just post them everywhere. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6069.86s)]
*  It's like, it's crowd-sourced comedy. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6075.86s)]
*  And now everyone with a sense of humor has a folder dedicated to memes. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6078.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6082.86s)]
*  Yeah, some people are quick with them too, like when my friends send me them sometimes. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6083.86s)]
*  Like, did you have that? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6086.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6088.26s)]
*  Just sitting there, do you have them categorized? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6089.26s)]
*  It all picked up during the pandemic, right? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6091.22s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6093.22s)]
*  Mm, meening? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6094.22s)]
*  Nah, meening was big before the pandemic. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6095.22s)]
*  Don't you think it got bigger during the pandemic? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6096.74s)]
*  You know what I think happened is I think there were memes that were more universal. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6100.3s)]
*  So it felt like that, like we all shared more stuff than we normally, you know what I mean? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6105.139999999999s)]
*  Like masks. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6109.62s)]
*  Yeah, like Tiger King type of deal. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6110.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6112.179999999999s)]
*  If that wasn't for the pandemic, that would have been kind of popular, but everyone wouldn't [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6113.179999999999s)]
*  have seen it. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6117.0199999999995s)]
*  Can you imagine if Trump pardoned him? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6118.0199999999995s)]
*  I thought he would have. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6119.94s)]
*  I wonder if he was on a list. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6120.94s)]
*  I thought he was going to, but I think he probably said some shit about Trump in the [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6123.3s)]
*  past. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6125.62s)]
*  Or something. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6127.5s)]
*  Not wise. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6128.5s)]
*  Because it's wild that he wouldn't do it because so many people wanted him to. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6129.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6132.9s)]
*  Is he in jail? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6133.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6134.9s)]
*  I thought he was dying of cancer. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6135.9s)]
*  I don't know, this is supposed to be yesterday. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6138.9s)]
*  So, he says, yeah, I don't know. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6143.9s)]
*  What is it? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6148.9s)]
*  He tagged Trump? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6149.9s)]
*  This can't be real. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6150.9s)]
*  What is this thing? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6153.9s)]
*  This is his account, because they messaged me on that. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6155.179999999999s)]
*  It said, someone better start doing reform because they and their families are supporting [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6157.78s)]
*  me because you never keep your promises. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6164.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6166.58s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6167.58s)]
*  I'm not sure what that means, but that guy, I mean, what a weird cultural phenomenon, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6170.58s)]
*  right? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6175.7s)]
*  Everyone's locked in their home, and then all of a sudden there's this wacky reality [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6176.7s)]
*  show about a dude who collects tigers and everybody's telling you you have to see it. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6179.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they were right. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6184.34s)]
*  It was great, but they just caught lightning in a bottle. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6186.0199999999995s)]
*  They hit the perfect spot. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6189.3s)]
*  Yeah, they were like HBO by accident. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6190.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6193.18s)]
*  For once. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6194.18s)]
*  For one show. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6195.18s)]
*  Yeah, Tiger King was a, I mean, they've had a couple hits too, though. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6196.18s)]
*  Yeah, but that one was like everywhere. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6199.26s)]
*  He was running for president. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6201.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6202.22s)]
*  He was trying to. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6203.22s)]
*  State sends back his paperwork because he's not on the presidential ballot in Colorado. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6207.22s)]
*  Colorado's like, no, son. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6211.38s)]
*  God damn. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6213.9800000000005s)]
*  The smelling salts, man. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6215.74s)]
*  I'm just coming back to normal. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6217.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just, it still burns a little bit. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6218.7s)]
*  Yeah, my right nostril's still a little bit up. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6221.3s)]
*  But boy, I'm breathing good. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6223.3s)]
*  Yeah, it cleaned you out. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6224.3s)]
*  Is that what that's for? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6225.78s)]
*  I think that's what that's for. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6226.78s)]
*  Well, I think it's just the central nervous stimulant. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6227.78s)]
*  The idea is that you get that jolt of it and your whole body's like, ah, and then you [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6230.3s)]
*  get fucking raw. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6233.74s)]
*  Yo, do that in the cold plunge. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6234.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6237.26s)]
*  I remember from when people fainting, they used to break it out when you faint, and then [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6238.26s)]
*  you put it in the smelling salts and you wake up. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6242.38s)]
*  But then people started doing other shit. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6244.38s)]
*  Of course. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6245.78s)]
*  But imagine waking up, now you got a concussion and you can't breathe. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6246.78s)]
*  What is the, what's the purpose of amyl nitrate? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6249.82s)]
*  Because those were poppers. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6254.34s)]
*  And people would take amyl nitrate and they would pop it under their nose and sniff it. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6257.66s)]
*  And it would get really high. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6261.34s)]
*  I know, it's a sex thing. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6263.06s)]
*  It's used to, it makes you want to fuck. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6265.22s)]
*  Vasodilator. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6267.9400000000005s)]
*  Vasodilators are medicines that cause the blood vessels in the body to dilate and involuntary [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6269.54s)]
*  smooth muscles to relax, lowering blood pressure and loosening up that booty hole. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6272.94s)]
*  That's what, apparently that was a big thing in the gay community and contributed to, like, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6279.179999999999s)]
*  I guess it like really fucks you up. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6288.219999999999s)]
*  I think amyl nitrate, I think it gives you brain damage. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6290.379999999999s)]
*  Also a cyanide poisoning antidote. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6294.54s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6297.0599999999995s)]
*  Also if you get cyanide poisoning, you crack one of those babies? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6299.06s)]
*  One of those things from the 20s and 30s that I don't know if people get cyanide poisoning [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6301.1s)]
*  these days. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6304.3s)]
*  I remember there was always like the fucking, the spy that had a fake tooth. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6305.3s)]
*  But it's illegal to sell, it's like a sex thing. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6308.9400000000005s)]
*  So they sell it. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6312.18s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6313.18s)]
*  Yeah, so it's VCR head cleaner is what they sell. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6314.18s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6317.1s)]
*  So that's how they sell it. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6318.1s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6319.46s)]
*  So it's like, if you go into a porn store or an adult store, it's the only thing in [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6320.46s)]
*  there that'll help, that's a VCR product. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6325.5s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6328.42s)]
*  But it's definitely not poppers. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6329.42s)]
*  It's not for sniffing for sex. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6330.42s)]
*  Right, that's like bath salts. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6332.42s)]
*  It's a cleaning of VCR, which everyone has. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6334.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, bath salts. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6336.54s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, is that a sex thing? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6338.34s)]
*  Well bath salts was a drug, like an amphetamine type drug, like a designer drug that they [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6340.58s)]
*  were selling that you could buy at like fucking 7-Eleven. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6346.5s)]
*  You'd buy it like a supermarket or like a convenience store, gas station store. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6350.34s)]
*  And these things they would say, not for human consumption, bath salts. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6355.379999999999s)]
*  And it was like an amphetamine, and people were smoking it. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6359.7s)]
*  You don't remember that? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6362.5s)]
*  I remember bath salts being a thing, but I never was like into it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6364.82s)]
*  I was never into it. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6367.98s)]
*  Well it was in the news because like some dude was on bath salts and he ate some guy's [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6368.98s)]
*  face. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6372.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but that wasn't, ended up not being because of the bath salts. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6373.379999999999s)]
*  Well he was fucking insane. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6376.82s)]
*  He was insane, right. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6378.099999999999s)]
*  But the bath salts definitely didn't help. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6379.179999999999s)]
*  I mean if you're on meth and you're insane. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6381.379999999999s)]
*  If you're already prone to some kind of delusional shit, it's just going to make it worse. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6384.62s)]
*  What is the deal, what were bath salts? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6389.66s)]
*  I think it was more than one different chemical because it's not regulated. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6391.66s)]
*  I'm making sure it wasn't this stuff. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6394.78s)]
*  But can you actually use bath salts for baths? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6397.0199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6399.22s)]
*  Okay so it's all bullshit. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6400.22s)]
*  No. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6401.22s)]
*  I mean if you did you'd probably die. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6402.22s)]
*  Synthetic cathinones. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6403.22s)]
*  Probably all that bath salts would get into your skin from the warm water. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6404.22s)]
*  All that meth. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6408.22s)]
*  You think a meth bath? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6409.22s)]
*  Yeah, it'll get in your skin. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6412.22s)]
*  You think it's just a meth bath? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6414.820000000001s)]
*  Well if you did it that way, if you did pour it into hot water, it would most likely get [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6416.820000000001s)]
*  in your skin. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6422.820000000001s)]
*  It'll get in your holes for sure. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6423.820000000001s)]
*  It's a synthetic version of this drug. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6424.820000000001s)]
*  Cat. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6427.22s)]
*  Oh that's what the Somali pirates take. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6428.22s)]
*  Can you make that larger? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6431.12s)]
*  What does cat do? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6432.62s)]
*  Does it just make you want to? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6433.62s)]
*  It's like an amphetamine. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6434.62s)]
*  Cathinone is a monoamine alkaloid found in the shrub cathus adulis and is chemically [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6435.62s)]
*  similar to ephedrine. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6441.280000000001s)]
*  Is it ephedrine? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6444.08s)]
*  Ephedrine. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6445.08s)]
*  Cathine, meth, meth, cathinone, cath, cathine, meth, cathinone and other amphetamines. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6446.08s)]
*  So it's an amphetamine. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6455.08s)]
*  It's probably the main contributor to the stimulant effect of cathus adulis also known [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6456.08s)]
*  as cat. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6461.28s)]
*  So cathinone is bath salts. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6462.38s)]
*  Synthetic cathinones. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6465.38s)]
*  Synthetic cathinones. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6466.38s)]
*  Marketed as bath salts should not be confused with products such as epsom salts which people [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6468.38s)]
*  use during bathing. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6473.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I wonder how many people bought it and thought it was actual bath salts and poured [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6474.0s)]
*  it in the bath. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6478.2s)]
*  And you, I bet they did. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6479.48s)]
*  Because if it says bath salts, some really fucking stupid person doesn't know. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6481.84s)]
*  They're breaking into buildings to get that shit back in like 2011. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6486.48s)]
*  The bath salts. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6490.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6491.08s)]
*  Yeah that's why like if you mention that a drug is killing people. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6492.08s)]
*  People want to buy it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6495.64s)]
*  Yeah people want it. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6496.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6497.64s)]
*  K2 is big at the same time. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6498.64s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6499.64s)]
*  What was K2? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6500.64s)]
*  An herb like substance that people smoked instead of weed that they sprayed shit on. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6502.280000000001s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6507.64s)]
*  And then they would, they kept changing what they were spraying on it every so often because [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6508.64s)]
*  it would get outlawed. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6512.360000000001s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6513.360000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6514.360000000001s)]
*  It was then like, then I'll show the salvia. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6515.360000000001s)]
*  Then people were like, oh is it like the salvia shit that we're smoking? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6519.4800000000005s)]
*  Salvia. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6522.6s)]
*  It's not like that. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6523.6s)]
*  That is not the same thing. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6524.6s)]
*  Salvia strong. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6526.84s)]
*  I've done salvia once and I. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6527.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6530.4800000000005s)]
*  Salvia is real. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6532.32s)]
*  I mean that is a real fucking drug. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6533.32s)]
*  Spice. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6534.32s)]
*  Spice they also call it. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6535.32s)]
*  Salvia might be the strongest. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6536.32s)]
*  It might, in terms of its effect, maybe the strongest drug I've ever taken. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6537.32s)]
*  Well do you know that salvia is, it's either in the family of sage or, what do you want? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6540.919999999999s)]
*  Tissues. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6547.12s)]
*  It's either in the sage family or it is sage. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6548.12s)]
*  Like salvia divinorum I think is, which is interesting because you know sage, we've always [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6552.36s)]
*  wise old sage, like some ancient wisdom and the fact that it's actually a psychedelic. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6558.4400000000005s)]
*  Is that the same thing? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6565.04s)]
*  Like if you buy sage is that salvia? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6566.04s)]
*  No. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6567.84s)]
*  No. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6568.84s)]
*  Is it a version of it? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6569.84s)]
*  It's just called diviner sage or seer sage. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6570.84s)]
*  I don't. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6573.6s)]
*  It's not an actual sage? [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6574.6s)]
*  I mean it's a plant, it's a shrub, I don't know. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6575.6s)]
*  Maybe it's like a, oh okay. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6578.6s)]
*  But that stuff used to be able to buy it everywhere. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6582.24s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6584.400000000001s)]
*  It's so powerful. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6585.6s)]
*  Dude, so the first time I did it, I remember, like I thought that my body had shattered [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6587.120000000001s)]
*  into like little millions of mini-me's and I was like panicking trying to keep myself [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6594.96s)]
*  together in one. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6599.92s)]
*  That's what sage is called, salvia. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6600.92s)]
*  Oh so it's related somehow. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6603.200000000001s)]
*  It says salvia, so salvia divinorum is the salvia that is, yeah okay. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6605.6s)]
*  And so that's a different kind of salvia that's sage? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6613.88s)]
*  Yeah, that must be like salvia's got to be some sort of, it's the genus so that's like [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6616.68s)]
*  a leaf plant. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6621.28s)]
*  So somehow another related. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6622.28s)]
*  Largest, yeah yeah. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6623.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6624.28s)]
*  Man, you know that people use that drug to like try to be shaman. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6625.28s)]
*  They're like yeah I took some salvia, this is what I saw, that's your future. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6628.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like oh god. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6631.88s)]
*  Right, because you will see some crazy shit. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6632.88s)]
*  There was a girl with me doing it the first time I did it and she wanted to do hers in [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6635.52s)]
*  the bathtub filled with pillows. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6640.0s)]
*  She's like oh that would be so cool or whatever and they put her in there and she took the [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6642.4s)]
*  hit and we closed the door and she screamed for like 30 seconds. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6645.919999999999s)]
*  She thought she was falling in the bottom of this pit. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6650.2s)]
*  See the thing about salvia is this is why salvia is so powerful because it's the only [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6654.12s)]
*  drug I've ever taken where it is impossible for you to realize that you're on drugs. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6658.639999999999s)]
*  You whatever, it only lasts for you know 30 seconds or so but you think that shit is happening [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6665.919999999999s)]
*  Like there's no doubt in your mind, there's no point where you can stop and be like it's [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6671.96s)]
*  okay I'm on salvia. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6675.679999999999s)]
*  You know like if you do too many mushrooms or you do too much mushrooms, you're like [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6677.0s)]
*  I'm just real high. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6679.679999999999s)]
*  No, on salvia you're like this is happening. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6680.679999999999s)]
*  I'm literally falling into the abyss. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6683.599999999999s)]
*  Somebody kicked me into the pit from 300. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6685.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6687.599999999999s)]
*  Did you ever see the video of Ari where he took salvia on Red Band Show? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6689.5599999999995s)]
*  He took salvia on Red Band Show and said he lived another life for months. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6695.48s)]
*  He said he had friends, he went to work, he had relationships, all this different shit [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6699.96s)]
*  and then he woke up. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6704.0s)]
*  He was gone, he said, for months. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6709.16s)]
*  And it was like 10 minutes. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6711.84s)]
*  So he just tripped balls for 10 minutes. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6714.8s)]
*  I encourage everyone to watch it. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6716.12s)]
*  He was taking bong rips and he didn't take the first one good enough so he took another [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6717.6s)]
*  hit and then this is like the start of a 5 minute video where he just starts slipping [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6722.68s)]
*  away. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6728.08s)]
*  And then he just went into another dimension, lived a different life. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6729.48s)]
*  That's when he starts coming back because things start getting real different. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6731.76s)]
*  That's what freaks me out. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6734.5599999999995s)]
*  What if that's really what's going on? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6736.28s)]
*  What if there's like multiple Brian Simpsons living in multiple realms all over the world [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6738.24s)]
*  right now? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6743.16s)]
*  And that's what dreaming is? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6744.16s)]
*  All over the universe. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6745.16s)]
*  Is you just connecting to your different bodies? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6746.16s)]
*  Connecting to your consciousness, to different portals. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6749.32s)]
*  I think there's a lot to that belief that the fact that we're all separate beings is [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6752.84s)]
*  an illusion. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6757.68s)]
*  You're just a little piece that's living, a little piece that but you're connected to [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6758.68s)]
*  everything. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6762.76s)]
*  Do you think that there's a purpose to this struggle then? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6763.76s)]
*  If we're all connected in some ways, what is everyone struggling, what is that facilitating? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6768.52s)]
*  What's that creating that's necessary? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6776.08s)]
*  Why is that happening? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6778.240000000001s)]
*  What's the overall purpose of that if we're all connected? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6779.64s)]
*  I don't think there is a purpose. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6782.96s)]
*  No? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6784.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6785.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's doing something. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6786.4400000000005s)]
*  The need for purpose is a human affliction. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6788.2s)]
*  The need for things to mean something. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6791.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6793.24s)]
*  It's like when you see a shark eat a or you see a killer whale eat a seal, you don't go [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6794.24s)]
*  what does it mean? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6802.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6803.28s)]
*  And the whale's definitely not thinking that. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6804.28s)]
*  They're just being. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6806.2s)]
*  I don't think there's a purpose. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6807.799999999999s)]
*  I think we just are. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6810.08s)]
*  The purpose is to experience. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6811.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6813.2s)]
*  But the thing that's happening with human beings with this struggle and this conquering [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6814.2s)]
*  resources and all the different. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6820.12s)]
*  One of the things they're doing is they're constantly creating new and better things. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6822.12s)]
*  And it seems to like an overall purpose of the human race. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6827.4s)]
*  I just wonder if somehow or another that competition is what facilitates this increase in technology [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6830.84s)]
*  and innovation. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6836.48s)]
*  Part of it is because of the competition. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6838.04s)]
*  Part of it is because of the fact that we don't get along. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6840.04s)]
*  Like there's like the struggle that creates movement. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6842.04s)]
*  Well human beings we need competition to survive. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6845.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6849.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6850.56s)]
*  If you were ever in charge of a big group of people and you need. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6851.56s)]
*  The best thing to do is to break them into two teams and keep score. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6857.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6861.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6862.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6863.84s)]
*  We need. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6864.84s)]
*  I think it's something human nature. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6865.84s)]
*  We need an enemy for us to unite. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6866.84s)]
*  That's why like you know America was never more together than like the month after 9 [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6867.84s)]
*  11. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6871.64s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6872.64s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6873.64s)]
*  Because like oh now there's a them. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6874.64s)]
*  And we all feel justified because we don't know about it. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6875.64s)]
*  Remember the American flags on everybody's car? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6877.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6879.64s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6880.64s)]
*  You had people listening to country music they never had. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6881.64s)]
*  We'll put a boot in your head. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6883.64s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6886.64s)]
*  People got very excited about it. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6887.64s)]
*  So it's like I think that's just how people are built up. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6888.64s)]
*  They did that to us in the military. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6891.52s)]
*  You have you know it's like well obviously we're all the same unit. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6893.160000000001s)]
*  We're all the same big unit with the same mission. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6897.04s)]
*  But you know is your company versus my company? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6899.64s)]
*  Is your platoon versus my platoon? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6901.8s)]
*  Is your squad versus my squad within the platoon? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6903.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's like the competition it pushes people. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6905.64s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6908.280000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants to win. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6910.320000000001s)]
*  Winning feels great. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6911.320000000001s)]
*  Triumph. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6912.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6913.320000000001s)]
*  That's the best shit ever. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6914.320000000001s)]
*  When you watch another person triumph you're like you feel it. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6915.320000000001s)]
*  Like when Izzy beat Pereira we felt that shit. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6918.360000000001s)]
*  We were all we were in the mothership green room. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6922.64s)]
*  I think you were calling the fights. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6924.4400000000005s)]
*  Man that moment we lost our shit in there man. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6926.36s)]
*  And we were all looking at like a laptop screen and everybody was like ah ah ah ah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6931.16s)]
*  And then the speech he gave afterwards like everything was just so perfect and you felt [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6936.04s)]
*  that fucking. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6939.08s)]
*  That's as good as entertainment ever gets. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6940.96s)]
*  Yeah he's like I just wish you could have this feeling. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6943.599999999999s)]
*  It's like oh I know that feeling. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6947.24s)]
*  But at his level that's gotta be insane. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6950.36s)]
*  The best of the world. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6953.32s)]
*  Redemption. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6954.32s)]
*  Overcoming the demon. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6955.32s)]
*  Revenge. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6956.8s)]
*  Revenge. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6957.8s)]
*  Flatlining the demon. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6958.8s)]
*  All the worst things. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6960.84s)]
*  All the most. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6961.84s)]
*  He triumphed over like three things in that one moment. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6963.5199999999995s)]
*  And he triumphed over the guy stylistically which is the most dangerous opponent for him. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6966.12s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6971.28s)]
*  What I love so much about that moment. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6973.36s)]
*  You gotta love. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6975.32s)]
*  This is what I love about Izzy. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6976.32s)]
*  He knows how to be an entertainer. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6979.0s)]
*  A lot of the fighters don't realize that. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6982.240000000001s)]
*  It's like you have to be. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6983.96s)]
*  The greatest part was the arrows when he shot the arrows into his body. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6986.64s)]
*  Because what was so beautiful about that moment to me is he won in the same position that [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6990.320000000001s)]
*  he lost the last time. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6996.120000000001s)]
*  The last time he got in that position where he was getting wailed on up against the fence [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=6997.88s)]
*  he lost. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7001.0s)]
*  And then he got put back right in that same position and had a fucking plan for it. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7002.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7006.96s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7007.96s)]
*  Did you see the videos of him drilling that? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7008.96s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7010.4800000000005s)]
*  He drilled that. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7012.4s)]
*  He drilled that over and over again. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7013.4s)]
*  Back to the rows, right hand. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7014.4s)]
*  Back to the rows, right hand. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7015.4s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7016.4s)]
*  Of course. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7017.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7018.4s)]
*  There's tons of video of him with his back to a wall in training throwing that right [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7019.4s)]
*  hand. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7021.679999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7022.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7023.679999999999s)]
*  He went over the videos. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7024.679999999999s)]
*  He saw the hole. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7025.679999999999s)]
*  You know, he went over the fights. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7026.679999999999s)]
*  He saw the style. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7028.839999999999s)]
*  The style is so different. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7029.839999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7030.839999999999s)]
*  Look at the fucking blood clots. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7031.839999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7032.839999999999s)]
*  So they planned this. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7033.839999999999s)]
*  And look how the guy's fighting. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7037.5199999999995s)]
*  He's fighting like Pahira. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7039.08s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7040.08s)]
*  Literally the same right hand off the cage. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7041.08s)]
*  Same exact right hand. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7047.48s)]
*  Did it perfect. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7048.48s)]
*  But that's also the same right hand that he landed at the end of the first round. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7049.5599999999995s)]
*  So the end of the first round in the first MMA fight, he had Pahira in real trouble. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7053.36s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7057.76s)]
*  But then the bell rang. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7058.76s)]
*  He would have had him right there. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7059.76s)]
*  It's basically he had him in the same trouble he had him with the first right hand where [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7060.76s)]
*  he knocked him out in the second fight. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7063.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7065.5599999999995s)]
*  Because it was the second shot that put him away. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7066.5599999999995s)]
*  The first shot rocks him. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7067.96s)]
*  The second shot puts him away. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7068.96s)]
*  And then the hammer fits him. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7069.96s)]
*  And they actually have a lot of respect for each other. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7070.96s)]
*  But the thing is, you know, I always feel bad for the foreign fighters or I'll say this, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7074.56s)]
*  fighters where English is not their first language when it comes to the shit talking [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7081.72s)]
*  game because it's so cultural. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7085.24s)]
*  And if you're not immersed enough in American culture, that trash talk, because Pahira was [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7088.52s)]
*  probably saying some shit where like if you speak Portuguese, you were like, talking [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7095.4s)]
*  this shit. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7099.04s)]
*  But in English, it doesn't translate. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7100.04s)]
*  You know, like, you know, like, it's not the same thing. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7101.799999999999s)]
*  He's like, Oh, a man with two horses. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7104.639999999999s)]
*  It's like that's that's not it's not coming across. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7107.719999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7110.2s)]
*  In Brazil, like he talking that shit. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7111.599999999999s)]
*  But over here, you can't talk shit with Izzy in English because you don't you can't keep [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7113.36s)]
*  up now. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7117.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7118.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7119.5599999999995s)]
*  He has to get by just on his talent. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7120.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, his his draw is just his destruction ability. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7122.8s)]
*  Oh, he is talented. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7125.96s)]
*  Oh, he's so talented. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7126.96s)]
*  He's moving up, right? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7127.96s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7129.24s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7130.24s)]
*  Anderson Silva said he thought it was a mistake. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7131.24s)]
*  Moving up? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7133.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7134.52s)]
*  I didn't read the article. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7135.52s)]
*  I just read the headline. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7136.52s)]
*  It said Anderson Silva thought it was a mistake for him to move up to 205, which is interesting, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7137.52s)]
*  because I don't know if that's necessarily true. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7140.72s)]
*  I think he's going to I think he's going to dominate. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7143.04s)]
*  Well, the problem is wrestlers. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7144.92s)]
*  The problem is wrestlers because Izzy, you know, had him in some real bad positions in [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7146.96s)]
*  that first fight. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7150.84s)]
*  Anderson Silva, not a fan of Pajeros, moved to 205. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7153.12s)]
*  He wanted Pajero to win back the middleweight title before moving to light heavyweight. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7156.0s)]
*  I think that cut is too much. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7159.679999999999s)]
*  I think that cut is real bad for him. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7162.12s)]
*  Huge man. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7163.599999999999s)]
*  It's so bad for you. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7164.599999999999s)]
*  And he's I think he's 35 now. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7166.08s)]
*  There's a you know, at a certain age, like your body just does not want to do that anymore. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7168.879999999999s)]
*  You're killing yourself one day before a cage fight. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7173.24s)]
*  I was I was over getting punched in the face in my 20s. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7176.32s)]
*  The last time I got punched in the face, I was like, I don't like that. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7179.24s)]
*  Not going to do it on purpose, especially getting punched in the face by that guy or [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7181.919999999999s)]
*  either one of those guys. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7184.96s)]
*  But you know, facing Jan Bojovic, which is a fucking wild fight. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7186.08s)]
*  That's going to be a problem. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7189.96s)]
*  And Jan Bojovic is a very good grappler, too. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7191.36s)]
*  So, you mean he dominated Izzy on the ground. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7193.679999999999s)]
*  And you know what to Jan is very good at game planning. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7195.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, he's also got tremendous power. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7198.96s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking tremendous Polish power. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7202.839999999999s)]
*  But he doesn't always show up. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7205.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, if you look at the Glover to share a fight, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7207.76s)]
*  that's a fight where he, you know, you could say he didn't show up. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7211.4400000000005s)]
*  But I don't think that's the case. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7214.68s)]
*  I think that Glover is just that good. Yeah. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7215.8s)]
*  And yeah. And I mean, especially that was like Glover's kind of last swan song. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7218.52s)]
*  He won the title. Well, he just didn't. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7222.84s)]
*  He did. OK, maybe he didn't show up. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7224.360000000001s)]
*  It's not fair. Jan, I would never say that to you in person. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7226.04s)]
*  I would say he didn't seem as locked in as he did when he fought Izzy. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7229.400000000001s)]
*  I think I genuinely think that that's just how good Glover is. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7234.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah, I think Glover's a beat. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7239.04s)]
*  He's just in his 40s, but he's still a fucking animal, man. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7240.839999999999s)]
*  And in that fight, when he won the title, he was stellar. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7245.16s)]
*  I mean, if you watch the performance, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7248.4s)]
*  you watch how he catches Jan with a left hand, how he takes him down, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7249.879999999999s)]
*  how he takes his back, I mean, you can't really put it against Jan. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7253.28s)]
*  I think he got clipped. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7257.24s)]
*  You think he's going to be done? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7258.12s)]
*  Glover or Jan? Glover. Yeah, I think Glover's done. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7260.24s)]
*  Yeah, Glover retired after Jamal Hill boxed him up. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7263.28s)]
*  Jamal Hill showed him, I think, that at the top of the light [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7266.24s)]
*  heavyweight division now, these young guys, especially a talented striker [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7269.599999999999s)]
*  like Jamal, that's just too much. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7273.24s)]
*  Fighting more than any other sport, the UFC moves the fastest in terms of [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7275.5199999999995s)]
*  of the next generation, like adopting. Yeah. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7281.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I believe it's true of fighting comedy, whatever. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7284.32s)]
*  I think the the current generations [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7288.84s)]
*  amazing becomes the next generation's basics. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7293.24s)]
*  Right. Where and then they build and then that becomes their basics. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7296.36s)]
*  And so the amazing shit they do is even more amazing. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7299.639999999999s)]
*  It's like it's like basketball, right? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7302.5599999999995s)]
*  Whereas like I remember seeing Michael Jordan, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7304.68s)]

*  unless they have a good friend of yours with you. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7745.8s)]
*  Yeah, because if you FaceTime me, that means I can't do anything else [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7748.68s)]
*  while I'm talking to you. Right. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7751.76s)]

*  We don't need to be looking at each other to talk to each other. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7768.16s)]
*  Yeah. And FaceTime, they can drag on to and you're holding that thing up. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7770.0s)]
*  OK, yeah, I got to go. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7774.28s)]
*  I'm tired of doing this. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7776.4s)]
*  I stopped trying to think of clever little lies. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7777.36s)]
*  It's like, hey, man, I'm going to get up off of you. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7780.5599999999995s)]
*  How do you FaceTime on an Android? [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7782.16s)]
*  What do you mean? And someone FaceTimes you. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7784.12s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7786.44s)]
*  So if I get if I get a FaceTime from an Apple thing, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7788.24s)]
*  I can just click a link and FaceTime them. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7790.799999999999s)]
*  But does it look cool? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7792.879999999999s)]
*  But Google has like Google Meet and then, you know, and then there's a Discord. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7793.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, not Discord. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7797.759999999999s)]
*  What was the shit that got popular during the pandemic? [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7798.48s)]
*  The zoom. Zoom. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7801.28s)]
*  Yeah. But usually Google has Google Meet. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7802.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So and if and if not, I get a link and I just go anyway. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7805.84s)]
*  I don't think I can do it the other way around. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7810.12s)]
*  I don't think I can send you a Google Meet link. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7811.599999999999s)]
*  Really? I don't think so. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7813.28s)]
*  That seems like silly. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7815.12s)]
*  They finally figured out thumbs up or liking the text messages on both. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7816.96s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Finally, thumbs up a green. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7820.88s)]
*  Well, it's just Apple. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7823.04s)]
*  It's just Apple holding that walled garden, right? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7824.2s)]
*  They won't allow you to send iMessages on any other device. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7826.599999999999s)]
*  No. Then you would just get a Samsung phone [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7830.679999999999s)]
*  and send iMessages to your Apple friends. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7833.16s)]
*  All right. I'm going to try to I'm going to try to FaceTime you from here. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7835.24s)]
*  OK. Don't call it FaceTime, though, because it's some bullshit Google thing. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7838.92s)]
*  Stop blind yourself. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7843.72s)]
*  I think this is it right. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7844.84s)]
*  OK, good. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7847.5199999999995s)]
*  OK, I sent you the invite. Did you get it? [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7848.84s)]
*  Nope. It is weird. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7851.5599999999995s)]
*  Some apps you get a phone call on an app and it just shows up like your phone's ringing [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7853.36s)]
*  and you're like, hold on, what is this? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7856.639999999999s)]
*  Someone's calling me from WhatsApp. How the fuck that happens? [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7858.8s)]
*  Oh, see, I can't initiate it. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7860.84s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7863.72s)]
*  Interesting. Seems like it's not working. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7867.8s)]
*  It's not working. Sucks. Not working. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7869.4800000000005s)]
*  How close have you come to switching to the dark side? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7871.96s)]
*  Oh, honestly, I really, really thought about the other day. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7874.68s)]
*  Really? Because my cat went missing for a day. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7879.76s)]
*  Oh, it didn't have an air tag. Right. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7884.8s)]
*  Well, she the bitch won't wear a collar. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7886.4400000000005s)]
*  She's wearing like anti-control measures, you know what I'm saying? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7888.28s)]
*  But but there is one there is a certain kind of collar that I could force her to keep on. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7890.92s)]
*  Like she would be fucked. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7897.96s)]
*  She would fucking hate it. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7899.16s)]
*  Like she does. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7900.36s)]
*  But there's just way more options [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7901.679999999999s)]
*  because the way air tech, because Samsung has its version of air tags called smart tags. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7906.5199999999995s)]
*  But the way they work is they don't actually have GPS on them themselves. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7910.84s)]
*  They just connect to any nearby Samsung or Apple device. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7916.56s)]
*  And there's way more iPhones around. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7921.16s)]
*  So so it'll just it'll ping and it'll let it'll let the nearest iPhone device. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7923.0s)]
*  So it's all connected to a network. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7927.96s)]
*  So Apple can tell me, you know, basically, if you get an invite going, your air tag is here. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7929.56s)]
*  It means someone with an iPhone walked past that place. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7934.08s)]
*  Someone else with an Apple product was nearby. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7937.08s)]
*  That's that's all it can tell you. Really? Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7939.12s)]
*  So so when you get like the last location of an air tag thing, it just means there was [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7941.360000000001s)]
*  an Apple product near that shit. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7945.72s)]
*  So, you know, in America, Apple has the domination. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7947.72s)]
*  So it's like if I had put a Samsung air tag on her collar. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7953.8s)]
*  Right. What are the odds? [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7959.0s)]
*  It's just less chances that I'll get an accurate location of where she is. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7959.84s)]
*  Right. So that I really seriously thought about it, because, you know, I'm serious about my cat. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7963.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, I love that bitch. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7968.92s)]
*  But I just. Just the whole ecosystem. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7970.84s)]
*  Also, you don't want your cat to have to wear a collar if it's going to piss her off. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7975.599999999999s)]
*  She's wild. She don't like it. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7979.12s)]
*  She don't even like she don't like being constrained in any way. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7981.4s)]
*  Yeah. Now, all that sniffing and people try to come over like, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7984.08s)]
*  no, I'm real good with cats and they pick her up. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7987.8s)]
*  Wow. Fuck off me, bitch. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7989.84s)]
*  I try to tell them this cat different. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7991.36s)]
*  They got to sedate her at the vet. Wow. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7993.12s)]
*  Yeah. Just to do basic shit. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7995.679999999999s)]
*  They got to sedate her. Wow. Yeah. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7997.04s)]
*  She wow. I got I give her CBD drops before we go up in there. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=7999.48s)]
*  Because she don't she don't play that shit. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8004.04s)]
*  You know, I get it. I'm like, she's wild. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8006.12s)]
*  Yeah. Wild cat. She's wild. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8007.64s)]
*  She's wild. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8009.2s)]
*  You can't put a collar on her anyway. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8010.2s)]
*  Don't know. No, but you know, but like I said, she's a smart girl. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8011.88s)]
*  She's been going outside for years. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8014.84s)]
*  She's she knows what to be scared of. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8016.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. There's not a whole lot of coyotes in Austin proper either. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8018.92s)]
*  It's really out in the hills. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8022.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what, though? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8024.24s)]
*  No, because I forget. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8025.68s)]
*  They got Ron White's dog. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8027.24s)]
*  Remember that documentary I told you about about the coy wolves? [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8028.6s)]
*  What they were they were they were talking about how like [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8031.96s)]
*  their coyotes and every every major city. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8034.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you just don't see they're so good at staying in the shadows [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8038.5199999999995s)]
*  and in hiding everywhere. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8041.639999999999s)]
*  There's a great book on it called Coyote America. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8044.12s)]
*  Oh, man. They're everywhere. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8046.12s)]
*  Yeah. I had the author on the other day. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8047.8s)]
*  It's really it's an amazing story. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8049.92s)]
*  You know, they are they just why don't they kill them? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8051.68s)]
*  Is a huge part of the ecosystem. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8053.8s)]
*  They're just smart. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8055.4s)]
*  This is the thing like that when they killed off the wolves, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8056.5599999999995s)]
*  the wolves were the one thing that was kind of keeping the coyotes. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8059.799999999999s)]
*  What would happen is gray wolves and coyotes don't breed. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8063.839999999999s)]
*  But coyotes breed with red wolves, which are East Coast wolves. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8067.5599999999995s)]
*  So the coy wolves you see are predominantly [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8070.08s)]
*  their East Coast wolves that breed with coyotes. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8073.639999999999s)]
*  But will a gray wolf breed? They'll kill coyotes. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8076.44s)]
*  But would they breed with a coy wolf? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8078.959999999999s)]
*  Would they breed with a mixed? No, they don't. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8080.879999999999s)]
*  It's a different it's a different, I guess, a genus or subspecies. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8083.2s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly what the term would be, but it's a different animal. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8087.8s)]
*  And the coyote, when coyotes basically a wolf, it's just a small wolf. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8091.28s)]
*  And when coyotes get killed, they what happens is they do roll call [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8096.76s)]
*  when they scream out at night sometimes. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8101.360000000001s)]
*  And when one of them's missing, it forces the female to have more babies. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8103.2s)]
*  So they have larger litters and then they spread their territory out. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8107.08s)]
*  And so throw through persecution, [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8110.2s)]
*  like when they're trying to get them out of places, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8113.4800000000005s)]
*  what they've made them do is expand everywhere. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8115.56s)]
*  And now coyotes are in every single city in North America. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8118.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. They're in New York City. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8123.080000000001s)]
*  Coyotes are in Boston. They're everywhere. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8125.0s)]
*  And that wasn't the case 50, 60 years ago. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8127.280000000001s)]
*  It's like it's happened over the course of time where they keep just get out of my lawn. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8129.88s)]
*  Bang, bang. They shoot them. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8133.88s)]
*  And then the female coyote have more babies. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8135.080000000001s)]
*  And then you got a bigger problem. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8137.52s)]
*  And they they were everywhere in L.A. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8139.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But it's the way he was explaining it. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8141.400000000001s)]
*  It's an evolutionary thing because gray wolves, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8144.48s)]
*  when they encounter coyotes, they would kill them. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8147.32s)]
*  And so coyotes, in order to compete with the larger, more vicious gray wolves, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8149.44s)]
*  they just have more babies. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8154.44s)]
*  So they expand their territory and they have more babies. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8157.28s)]
*  So this strategy of like persecuting them and chasing them down, kill them, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8159.68s)]
*  it just makes more coyotes. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8163.44s)]
*  But isn't it but isn't there not enough food for more coyotes? [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8164.6s)]
*  They're eating everybody's cats. Right. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8167.52s)]
*  They're eating cats and dogs. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8170.08s)]
*  I mean, in L.A., that's like probably the number one reason why dogs and cats go missing. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8172.719999999999s)]
*  It's coyotes. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8176.639999999999s)]
*  And if they're hungry enough, they'll walk right up to you and take your dog. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8177.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They snatch them off people's leashes, especially old people walking a little dog. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8180.2s)]
*  What are you going to do? It's a little small wolf. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8184.08s)]
*  It's a 30 pound wolf. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8185.92s)]
*  You ain't going to stop that thing from running off with your poodle. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8187.4s)]
*  And people and the thing is, and if you was if you was a hurt one of those wolves, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8190.0s)]
*  yeah, I mean, one of those coyotes, even if it was attacking your dog, [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8193.32s)]
*  people would still be like, they'd be mad at you. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8196.08s)]
*  Yeah. You kill it. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8198.36s)]
*  Yeah, people are weird when they don't have a real understanding of what wild animals are. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8200.12s)]
*  They just have this like anthropomorphized Disney version of what animals are [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8204.76s)]
*  until you encounter one. Right. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8209.48s)]
*  You hear about that guy in Arizona a couple of days ago that got eaten by a bear. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8210.96s)]
*  No, he got killed by a bear while he was having coffee. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8214.2s)]
*  He just camping out, having a good time. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8216.84s)]
*  And this bear just runs up on him and starts fucking him up. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8218.88s)]
*  And no one can do it. No one had a gun. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8221.28s)]
*  They're trying to stop it. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8223.24s)]
*  No one had a gun. No one had a gun. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8224.64s)]
*  In Arizona, in Arizona, I didn't even know they had bears. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8226.36s)]
*  See if you can get the story. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8229.2s)]
*  Yeah, they have black bears. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8230.32s)]
*  Like a desert bear. Black bears. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8231.32s)]
*  There's a lot of black bears. Arizona is not all desert. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8233.52s)]
*  There's a lot of woods in Arizona. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8235.72s)]
*  Arizona man was mauled to death by a black bear and a rare unprovoked attack. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8237.08s)]
*  So he's just out there camping and the guy just fucking drinking his coffee. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8241.2s)]
*  And this bear runs up on him from multiple witness accounts [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8245.88s)]
*  and preliminary investigation of the scene. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8248.8s)]
*  Mr. Jackson had been sitting, having a coffee at a table on his property [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8250.6s)]
*  where he was building a home. Oh, I thought he was camping. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8254.52s)]
*  The sheriff's office. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8257.800000000001s)]
*  That's what the camper is. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8258.640000000001s)]
*  So the camper is just like where he's operating out of. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8259.560000000001s)]
*  The sheriff's office said in a Facebook post, adding, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8261.720000000001s)]
*  it was a remote, heavily wooded area. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8264.320000000002s)]
*  It appears a male black bear attacked Mr. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8266.720000000001s)]
*  Jackson, taking him unaware and dragged him approximately 75 feet down an embankment. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8268.800000000001s)]
*  Neighbors heard Jackson screaming, tried to help through shouts and car horns. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8273.640000000001s)]
*  But the bear did not release him until a neighbor shot him with his rifle. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8277.84s)]
*  Oh, so some guy did shoot him. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8281.12s)]
*  But unfortunately, at that time, Mr. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8282.720000000001s)]
*  Jackson succumbed to his horrible injuries. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8284.320000000002s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8286.8s)]
*  That's the thing about black bears. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8288.68s)]
*  Black bears are more more likely to be predatory attacks. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8289.88s)]
*  But imagine not starting with the gun. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8292.72s)]
*  I mean, that's the first thing. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8294.64s)]
*  Shoot it. You know, I mean, you got to probably run back to his house and get the gun. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8296.0s)]
*  Maybe the gun was in a safe, you know, maybe. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8299.28s)]
*  You know, that's tough. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8301.84s)]
*  How does a bear catch you unawares? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8302.68s)]
*  They can do it, man, if they're hungry. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8305.16s)]
*  So if that bear was predatory, that means that bear was really hungry. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8306.72s)]
*  It was like sneaking. Yeah. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8309.68s)]
*  They smell you. Maybe he was cooking. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8311.76s)]
*  Imagine a stealthy bear. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8313.6s)]
*  That's one of the scariest things on the planet. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8314.96s)]
*  Well, if the dude had coffee, maybe he had breakfast before he had coffee [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8316.679999999998s)]
*  and the smell of the breakfast was coming out of his little camper. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8319.48s)]
*  That's how you get when when they bait bears, they they they burn things [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8322.519999999999s)]
*  and put things in the air to get the bears to come. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8326.88s)]
*  Like when they bait them, when they bait them with like donuts and shit like that. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8329.919999999998s)]
*  They do that in certain places where it's heavily wooded areas. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8332.88s)]
*  And literally the only way to hunt black bears is to bait them. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8335.759999999998s)]
*  So you set up bait stands and you consistently feed those bears [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8339.359999999999s)]
*  at that spot all the time. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8342.96s)]
*  Like you drop by food, you know, every couple of times a week. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8344.4s)]
*  Oh, and then they get you. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8348.16s)]
*  Yeah, they know that that's the spot. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8350.279999999999s)]
*  And so then you go and you wait in front of that spot. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8351.8s)]
*  It's very dirty. It's a dirty game. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8355.0s)]
*  Sometimes they're waiting on your ass. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8356.759999999998s)]
*  Sometimes they are. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8358.759999999998s)]
*  I remember you. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8359.519999999999s)]
*  Wasn't you telling me about the whales that learn how to orcas? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8360.24s)]
*  Yeah, they've learned how to fuck people's boats up. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8362.8s)]
*  That's that's so funny to me. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8364.64s)]
*  It's crazy. It's kind of hilarious because for all these years, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8366.56s)]
*  we mistreat them. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8369.88s)]
*  And finally, they're like, enough. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8370.72s)]
*  Let's start fucking up your boats. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8373.08s)]
*  And they're real smart creatures. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8374.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8375.679999999998s)]
*  And they're probably teaching every whale in the ocean how to do that shit. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8376.0s)]
*  Probably. At least the whales there. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8378.24s)]
*  I think it's only one part of the world where this is happening right now. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8380.119999999999s)]
*  But the problem is the word gets out. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8382.56s)]
*  Yeah, they have some they have those songs they sing and they go hundreds [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8384.16s)]
*  of kilometers and that's how they tell each other. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8387.679999999998s)]
*  Hey, we fuck people up over here. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8390.279999999999s)]
*  Did you see that video of the people in a kayak and a whale swallows them? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8392.56s)]
*  No. These people are like they're whale watching. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8395.76s)]
*  And there's a whale down there and the whale literally [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8399.48s)]
*  swallows the entire kayak with the people in it. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8401.8s)]
*  So they weren't good at it. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8404.6s)]
*  And then spits them out. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8405.68s)]
*  I mean, well, we're all going to want to eat a kayak. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8407.48s)]

*  Well, I think that's how they were whale watching. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8412.4s)]
*  Look at this. Literally just takes the kayak. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8414.0s)]
*  Maybe he's annoyed with them. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8417.84s)]
*  Maybe the maybe the kayaks are fucking up their fishing. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8419.119999999999s)]
*  Look at that. Bro. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8422.199999999999s)]

*  This dude is in Egypt and he's off the shore. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8584.4s)]
*  Netflix Cruise whole boat exploded after back to back [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8586.84s)]
*  shark attacks in Hawaii. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8590.84s)]
*  Like something out of Jaws. Oh my God. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8592.16s)]
*  I think they were filming it, so we'll probably not see it until. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8594.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8597.24s)]
*  Oh, our planet, too. So that would probably be really good. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8598.24s)]
*  Wow. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8600.72s)]
*  Yeah, I heard like it was like a right out of Jaws. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8601.72s)]
*  So it was shark attack, a shark attack, and then the boat exploded. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8604.0s)]
*  Well, he's attacking the boat. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8606.32s)]
*  Yeah, like if it exploded, like because the gas, then yeah, that's right out of Jaws. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8608.119999999999s)]
*  But is this thing exploded or are they saying it just fell apart? [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8612.599999999999s)]
*  I think fell apart. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8616.08s)]
*  I think they said a rubber dinghy. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8617.599999999999s)]
*  Can you scroll back down a little bit there? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8619.56s)]
*  It says Nolan said the crew was only about 328 feet from the shore, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8622.32s)]
*  so they were able to make it safe to land, though barely on land. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8626.64s)]
*  Then they patched up the boat and deployed a rubber dinghy. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8629.4s)]
*  But that was attacked by giant trevallies, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8632.56s)]
*  marine fishes that can grow up to six feet long and weigh more than 100 pounds. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8635.599999999999s)]
*  That attack knocked out the dinghy's motor. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8640.24s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8642.439999999999s)]
*  The behavior of the sharks they encountered was extremely unusual, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8644.599999999999s)]
*  Nolan told Radio Times. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8647.320000000002s)]
*  They were incredibly hungry, so there might not have been enough natural food. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8649.24s)]
*  And they were just trying to anything that came across in the water. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8652.720000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8656.400000000001s)]
*  It said it was just released. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8657.84s)]
*  So it should be out. Let me check. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8659.04s)]
*  Let's go to the Egyptian guy first. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8662.04s)]
*  The Egyptian guy is rough because he's screaming for his dad. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8664.12s)]
*  He's like yelling, Papa, while he's getting eaten alive by sharks. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8667.800000000001s)]
*  Just like 100 yards offshore. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8672.320000000002s)]
*  And apparently this area. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8674.880000000001s)]
*  Now, we didn't. Did we find out if that's true? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8676.96s)]
*  Some of it told me that that area that they had dumped sheep carcasses [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8679.88s)]
*  into the ocean in that area to attract the sharks. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8683.679999999998s)]

*  They were in an area where they were tracking baby albatross chicks. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8842.84s)]
*  And they had an idea to get a good shot of tiger sharks [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8846.359999999999s)]
*  about to feed on them. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8848.92s)]
*  So they took two smaller inflatable boats out. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8850.24s)]
*  And that's what got attacked. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8853.519999999999s)]
*  And that's why they exploded. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8855.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's so stupid. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=8858.039999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I love watching people do things with their hands. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9083.48s)]
*  Craftsmanship, making watches and shit, little tiny microscope [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9086.0s)]
*  and they're fucking moving little pieces and gears around. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9089.24s)]
*  I love shit like that. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9091.519999999999s)]
*  Just some just somebody that's dedicated to their life or something. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9092.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Even schemers and scammers. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9095.4s)]
*  That's why I like a good I like a good a good a good like bank heist. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9098.24s)]
*  You hear the real life stories of like different heists and shit. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9102.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Some people have outsmarted everybody. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9106.439999999999s)]
*  That's why I'm [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9109.24s)]
*  you mean like when it comes to bank heists, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9111.6s)]
*  that's why I'm interested in this SPF thing. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9114.52s)]
*  What is that? Oh, the is apparently they just I just looked at it. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9116.92s)]
*  And we might have got memed out of the actual headline. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9120.92s)]
*  The memes on the Twitter space were going that he might get all charges dropped. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9124.76s)]
*  But I think nobody got five dropped 13 down to eight now. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9128.28s)]
*  And he's still going on trial. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9131.64s)]
*  What are the which ones? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9132.96s)]
*  Oh, OK. Which ones they get rid of? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9134.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9137.080000000002s)]
*  Like they could have maybe got overzealous with so many charges. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9137.560000000001s)]
*  They kept throwing things down and now got it down to point accurate charges [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9140.76s)]
*  or something. Right. Good point. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9144.92s)]
*  Because I'm sure when they went to bring in a person like that, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9146.400000000001s)]
*  they probably like double and triple down on charges. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9148.76s)]
*  One article says it's been worded as temporarily suspended charges. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9150.52s)]
*  So interesting. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9154.0s)]
*  It's that's where I go like that. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9155.480000000001s)]
*  And that motherfucker ain't going to prison. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9156.76s)]
*  You don't think so? [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9158.480000000001s)]
*  Maybe we'll go to a nice country. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9159.800000000001s)]
*  Listen, I've never is he a big he's a billionaire, right? [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9161.04s)]
*  Not anymore. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9165.56s)]
*  OK, well, he gave away a lot, though. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9166.800000000001s)]
*  He gave away a lot to the Democratic Party. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9169.2s)]
*  But being a being I've never seen a billionaire go to prison. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9171.32s)]
*  Oh, what about Bernie Madoff? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9174.880000000001s)]
*  OK, so let me let me let me let me give a caveat. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9176.800000000001s)]
*  The only time I've ever seen someone with that much money [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9180.880000000001s)]
*  go to prison is when they fuck with other rich people's money. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9183.4s)]
*  That's what this guy Bernie Madoff, the guy from Iran. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9186.28s)]
*  Yeah. Was he fucking with rich people? [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9188.800000000001s)]
*  Elizabeth Holmes. Yeah, that's a good one. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9190.880000000001s)]
*  She was sentenced to 135 months, 11 years, three months [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9193.2s)]
*  in federal prison for defrauding investors and thermos. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9196.160000000002s)]
*  And she's going to prison out here. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9198.84s)]
*  She's going to prison in Texas. Is she? Yeah. Yeah. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9200.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's not going to be because there's no. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9203.080000000002s)]
*  Maybe she probably still going to one of those nice 11 years. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9205.68s)]
*  And she just had a couple of kids. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9208.320000000002s)]
*  She pumped out a couple of kids before she went in, which is crazy. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9210.320000000002s)]
*  Right. Imagine getting having babies knowing you face in prison. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9212.960000000001s)]
*  I think she's a sociopath. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9215.640000000001s)]
*  Of course, she's a sociopath. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9217.28s)]
*  And I think people like that would think like if I have a kid, [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9218.640000000001s)]
*  maybe they're less likely to lock me up for a long time [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9221.12s)]
*  because they know I'm a mother. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9223.400000000001s)]
*  Listen, you might not want to hear. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9224.92s)]
*  You might not want to hear this out. But listen, every billionaire [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9226.640000000001s)]
*  should have like a couple of hood dudes on staff [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9229.960000000001s)]
*  because there's a certain kind of bullshit that only they can detect. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9234.480000000001s)]
*  If you you know, I'm saying it like if you if you had if you had had like a [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9238.800000000001s)]
*  if you had had like a Freddie Gibbs with you when you talk to that bitch, [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9243.92s)]
*  he would he would like David Lucas. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9246.76s)]
*  Right. He would have known right away she was full of shit. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9248.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9250.76s)]
*  Well, a lot of people knew she was full of shit. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9251.960000000001s)]
*  Well, right. But not the rich guys. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9253.68s)]
*  Because they even people inside the company knew she was full of shit. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9255.36s)]
*  Yeah. She knows that she knows how to fool people with money. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9258.48s)]
*  That's her whole skill. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9260.64s)]
*  You got to have somebody around. You know, they do that in Japan. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9261.800000000001s)]
*  They got the you know, their culture so much like respect and bowing and respect. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9264.68s)]
*  But so they they have an they have an American, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9268.68s)]
*  like a like a designated American on staff at the big companies. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9271.64s)]
*  And because they know he'll say shit that everybody else won't. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9275.32s)]
*  So he's around to be like, that's bullshit. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9278.64s)]
*  People like, ah, he's right, though. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9280.52s)]
*  But no one no one else. You know what I'm saying? Right. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9282.32s)]
*  Like I watched a thing on Netflix where they do they play the black boxes. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9284.48s)]
*  They do like reenactments of like plane crashes from the 80s. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9288.52s)]
*  And one of the problems back then was that [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9291.960000000001s)]
*  the captain of an airplane was like the captain of a ship. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9293.880000000001s)]
*  Like you didn't question him. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9296.12s)]
*  So half of the crashes were because some lower person [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9297.68s)]
*  wasn't empowered to say something. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9301.08s)]
*  Do you know that's why they switched Korean airlines? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9303.2s)]
*  They started making them speak English. Right. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9305.32s)]
*  Well, because, you know, yeah, because in Korea, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9307.36s)]
*  there's a very specific way of talking to people [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9310.68s)]
*  that are higher above you or more respectful. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9314.4s)]
*  And then there's boundaries, cultural boundaries [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9317.44s)]
*  that are very difficult to transcend. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9320.640000000001s)]
*  But when you're speaking English, they don't have that. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9322.6s)]
*  That sort of same hierarchy doesn't exist in the language. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9325.44s)]
*  And so they realize this is from I think it was Malcolm Gladwell's book [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9329.2s)]
*  where they describe how they to get over this problem. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9334.4s)]
*  They started making them speak English. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9337.6s)]
*  Oh, I see. Because because like, is that true? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9340.080000000002s)]
*  That make sure that's so like in Korean. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9342.12s)]
*  Thank you. Say thank you differently to like a superior. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9343.880000000001s)]
*  Yes, you would. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9346.92s)]
*  A stranger to a regular person. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9348.12s)]
*  I gave it to you. Yeah. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9349.640000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't question the superior if they said, you know, we're in this direction. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9350.400000000001s)]
*  You're like, no, we're wrong. This is off. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9354.68s)]
*  It's a lot like that in Japanese companies. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9356.44s)]
*  So a lot of not all of them, but a lot of them have it. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9359.36s)]
*  They have an American for that reason. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9361.44s)]
*  This is books, illustration, for the example. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9363.52s)]
*  So I don't know that that makes this better. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9366.44s)]
*  But this is what the book said, I guess. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9369.12s)]
*  So the end of the 90s, Korean Air had more plane crashes [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9370.560000000001s)]
*  than almost any other airline around the globe. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9373.320000000002s)]
*  Cockpit miscommunication has been a persistent factor in these accidents. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9375.36s)]
*  For example, the Korean Air flight 801 crash was attributed to the pilots [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9378.6s)]
*  decision to land despite the junior officer's disagreement. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9383.320000000002s)]
*  Evidence of high power distance, a culture that denotes a heavily [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9386.480000000001s)]
*  hierarchical society, Gladwell argues that this innate behavior [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9391.44s)]
*  of deep reverence towards elders and superiors highly contributes [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9396.12s)]
*  to cockpit miscommunication, especially on planes designed to be flown by two equals. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9400.0s)]
*  Unsurprisingly, it's been found the safest airlines are offered [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9404.76s)]
*  from the countries whose cultures do not value strict hierarchies. Interesting. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9407.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9412.2s)]
*  Because if you were like, motherfucker, we out of fuel. Right. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9414.12s)]

*  Now, why don't they make wouldn't it be more exciting to do this [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9652.640000000001s)]
*  as a first player? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9656.320000000002s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah, they kind of did. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9662.44s)]
*  But Diablo is kind of a different thing because. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9663.92s)]
*  Jesus, look at all the numbers. What are those numbers mean? [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9666.16s)]
*  So the numbers are how much damage you're doing, [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9668.16s)]
*  but the different colors mean different hits. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9670.76s)]
*  So like the yellow is a critical hit. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9673.12s)]
*  It just means you have a chance. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9675.679999999998s)]
*  You have a whatever you hit, you have a chance to do critical damage [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9677.4s)]
*  was like bonus hundred and fifty percent. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9679.96s)]
*  So what did you just do out of that box? [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9681.48s)]
*  Did he just grab some stuff? [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9683.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing is you're killing monsters. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9684.599999999999s)]
*  They're dropping items or you open in chest to drop in items. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9687.64s)]
*  The items make you stronger or give you different powers. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9691.4s)]
*  And you're you're trying to combine the right items [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9694.279999999999s)]
*  to have to to do bigger and bigger numbers. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9696.92s)]
*  And the more you play, the more items you get. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9699.279999999999s)]
*  So the more power you get, right? [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9700.88s)]
*  The more powerful items you get. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9702.439999999999s)]
*  The more powerful items you get. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9703.6s)]
*  So you get addicted. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9704.52s)]
*  Yep. And there's gambling in this. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9706.08s)]
*  So you're ridiculous. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9707.76s)]
*  Well, this is a real, real high level guy. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9710.16s)]
*  Real deep into the game. I mean, he's level 78. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9712.0s)]
*  What level are you? 76. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9714.68s)]
*  Jesus, you're right up there. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9717.76s)]
*  Yeah, the max level is 100. Wow. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9719.08s)]
*  There's only four thousand people that have hit level 100. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9722.0s)]
*  So those dudes chase those dudes chasing him or are they fighting with him? [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9724.2s)]
*  They're chasing him. Oh, wow. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9728.0s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody's on his team in this. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9729.92s)]
*  But you can play with you can like [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9732.12s)]
*  I play with Frank Crankesteel. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9734.640000000001s)]
*  And sometimes like if he signs on, like if I'm on and he signs on [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9736.960000000001s)]
*  and he sees I'm playing, he can just jump right in. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9740.6s)]
*  Oh, and so you guys could team up. Right. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9742.320000000002s)]
*  We can team up. We can be on my team. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9744.12s)]
*  And you talk shit to each other. Yeah. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9745.640000000001s)]
*  Or like we or we coordinate, for example, like [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9746.960000000001s)]
*  like you can't really see it because he killed him so fast. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9750.76s)]
*  But like sometimes he hits the monster and they turn purple. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9753.240000000002s)]
*  Purple means they're vulnerable. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9755.960000000001s)]
*  It means they take more damage. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9757.12s)]
*  But you can you can have other skills that like do better [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9758.12s)]
*  other shit when the monster is vulnerable. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9761.4s)]
*  So like I'll make everybody vulnerable. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9762.88s)]
*  And Frank has some skill that exploits that. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9764.48s)]
*  And so we kind of teaming up, you know, little stuff like that. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9767.8s)]
*  Sounds like a great way to waste your life. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9771.039999999999s)]
*  It's such a waste of time. Yeah. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9772.84s)]
*  It seems so addictive. But it's it's super addictive. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9774.359999999999s)]
*  But it but it's fun. It's also very fun. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9777.64s)]
*  And so, you know, they they didn't they didn't send me no merch. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9779.6s)]
*  I would like some merch Diablo people. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9782.88s)]
*  They're so good at making things like the more you play it, the more you get. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9784.48s)]
*  Well, that's what I was telling you is the the the perfect games [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9789.56s)]
*  are the ones where they have it's a power fantasy. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9792.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And in a in a fun loop, because because basically, you know, [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9794.84s)]
*  you're playing hours and hours and you're doing the same thing over and over again. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9798.0s)]
*  You're just killing hordes of monsters. Right. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9801.199999999999s)]
*  But the reward. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9802.96s)]
*  For that is spaced out just enough where you wanted it, [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9806.52s)]
*  because when you level up, it goes, ding, and you got to go. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9810.32s)]
*  And then everything dies, everything around you dies. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9813.56s)]
*  Whenever you level up, everything dies. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9815.84s)]
*  So it's like it's this big event. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9817.56s)]
*  And you level up like, oh, shit, and I can go put points into this power [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9819.519999999999s)]
*  because there's a whole skill tree. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9822.96s)]
*  So you unlock points to put in the skill tree and it makes it. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9824.56s)]
*  You can change how your skills act and all of this other shit. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9827.279999999999s)]
*  So it's like the the the options, the things to do are so varied. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9830.48s)]
*  And the and the and the loop is fun. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9834.6s)]
*  And you get rewarded at just the right intervals in that loop [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9837.32s)]
*  where you want to come back from one more dungeon, one more. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9840.6s)]
*  And then the next thing you know, 12 hours later, next thing you know, hours later. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9844.08s)]
*  I'm getting anxiety just hearing you talk about it. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9847.36s)]
*  Yeah. But I don't I don't really have that addictive of a person. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9849.400000000001s)]
*  Like I can I can stop whenever I want. That's good. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9852.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's good, because Duncan didn't. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9855.16s)]
*  Duncan Duncan was gone for long periods of time. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9857.44s)]
*  The first game like that was EverQuest. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9860.32s)]
*  Oh, that's what I heard. Yeah. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9862.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. EverQuest and then Wow kind of took that over. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9863.92s)]
*  But EverQuest originally I never I never got into that because I saw it. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9866.0s)]
*  I seen it ruin people's marriages. Yeah. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9868.960000000001s)]
*  And they came out with EverQuest 2. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9871.24s)]
*  I seen that fuck people up. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9872.640000000001s)]
*  You know, World of Warcraft. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9874.24s)]
*  I said I stayed away from I seen people. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9875.44s)]
*  I seen it fuck people up and Diablo 2 fucked me up. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9876.92s)]
*  And I was like and Diablo 3 was OK. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9879.04s)]
*  I didn't really play that much. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9880.44s)]
*  But this one has the same little something. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9881.28s)]
*  It's just the perfect mix of all those things. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9884.28s)]
*  And it makes you it's just like casinos. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9886.6s)]
*  Casinos know when you come in, that's why, you know, they put they put [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9889.6s)]
*  they have you put, you know, you don't put money in machines anymore. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9893.72s)]
*  Put money on a card. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9896.72s)]
*  Mm hmm. And that card is on your account. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9898.4s)]
*  So when you go sit out of that machine, they know, oh, you haven't played today. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9900.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9905.36s)]
*  You put you put your card in that machine and they go, they let you, you know, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9906.24s)]
*  the four four rolls are random in that fifth when you win a little. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9910.4s)]
*  You know, and because legally someone has to win the jackpot [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9914.6s)]
*  every X amount of rolls, like they can go X amount of rolls. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9917.64s)]
*  Someone someone has to win. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9920.92s)]
*  So they set the machine up like that. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9922.16s)]
*  But everything in between is just a game plan with you. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9923.44s)]
*  You win a little, you lose a little. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9926.36s)]
*  You play again, you win a lot more than that, but not a significant amount. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9928.52s)]
*  And that is enough to hook you. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9932.119999999999s)]
*  Now you now you're playing more and more. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9933.6s)]
*  And you win a little, win a little, win a little. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9935.8s)]
*  But if you sit there long enough, you're going to be out of money. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9937.439999999999s)]
*  And that's the whole point is all set up to take your money. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9939.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And people voluntarily sign up for that reward. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9942.84s)]
*  The rate, the lights flash, all that. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9946.48s)]
*  It goes into all that. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9948.84s)]
*  The color of the room, the way the room smells, the way it's set up. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9949.92s)]
*  Like it's a maze. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9953.8s)]
*  Yeah. You ever go to a casino for the first time. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9955.4s)]
*  It's fucking confusing as fuck. Yeah. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9957.84s)]
*  It's supposed to be that is everything set up for you to spend money [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9960.119999999999s)]
*  and feel comfortable doing it and get trapped in there. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9963.0s)]
*  That's why they walk in and give you a couple of drinks. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9965.44s)]
*  Yeah. Lower your inhibitions. Take a chance. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9967.88s)]
*  You see the girl at the poker machine that just pissed herself? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9970.16s)]
*  No. You ever see that? [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9973.119999999999s)]
*  There's a girl sitting. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9974.52s)]
*  Apparently, people at casinos say it happens all the time. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9975.24s)]
*  People are gambling and they don't want to get up. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9977.6s)]
*  So they just pee. Yeah. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9980.0s)]
*  That is wild. A gambling addiction. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9982.52s)]
*  Look at this lady. She's sitting there. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9984.48s)]
*  She looks good, too. Look, she's just pissing. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9986.08s)]
*  She's pissing while she's on the phone. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9989.4s)]
*  She's probably shitfaced, too. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9992.84s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9994.36s)]
*  But still, you don't know you're pissing on the floor. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9996.24s)]
*  Probably does. I think people just piss. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=9998.92s)]
*  There's the shitting is worse. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10000.800000000001s)]
*  But people are walking through grocery stores and they just like shit falls. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10002.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I've seen that. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10005.28s)]
*  Like they run on a marathon. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10006.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I saw one where this guy pulled his pants down the store [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10007.84s)]
*  and just shot rocket out of his asshole. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10010.52s)]
*  So who's how they shitting on that submarine. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10013.04s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10015.2s)]
*  That's done because you're not flushing that toilet. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10016.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I bet your anxiety is so high you're just not. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10018.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. No, my dude, that would be torture for me. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10021.36s)]
*  I'd be like, kill me first. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10023.92s)]
*  How much water do they have? [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10024.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, you might get dehydrated down there, too. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10026.52s)]
*  You might run out of water. Yeah. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10029.6s)]
*  And you can't go over any days without water. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10032.4s)]
*  I think three. Yeah. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10034.8s)]
*  I mean, how many days? No, seven. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10035.960000000001s)]
*  I think seven is the max. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10037.6s)]
*  You can go without water. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10040.32s)]
*  Fuck. You can probably make it like a month without food. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10041.6s)]
*  You can make it longer without food if you're fat. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10045.16s)]
*  Yeah, if you're real fat. Yeah. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10047.0s)]
*  But without water. Yeah. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10048.6s)]
*  You're done. You're done. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10050.84s)]
*  But it's a lot easier to find fresh water. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10052.08s)]
*  Or I'll say you could like you could even risk it [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10054.64s)]
*  and drink contaminated water in an emergency. Right. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10057.24s)]
*  It's not just food everywhere. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10061.039999999999s)]
*  I guess there's a I'm looking up updates. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10062.96s)]
*  A retired Navy captain just brought up the point [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10065.64s)]
*  about how cold it probably is down there. Oh, Jesus. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10068.12s)]
*  Because that doesn't probably have tons of insulation. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10070.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. And where they're at, this is the water entirely. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10073.12s)]
*  Surround the ship is that freezing or slightly below when they exhale, [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10075.68s)]
*  their breath condenses. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10078.2s)]
*  There's frost on the inside of the parts of the submarine. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10079.6s)]
*  They're all together trying to conserve body heat. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10081.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10083.679999999998s)]
*  And they're running low on oxygen and breathing each other's. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10084.759999999998s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10087.16s)]
*  Even if they find them. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10088.48s)]
*  How do you get it up? [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10091.279999999999s)]
*  How do you get it? [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10093.48s)]
*  Yeah, they have to tow it up or something. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10094.24s)]
*  Yeah, because when we started the podcast, you said how many hours left? [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10095.48s)]
*  Oh, there's they're down to their last day. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10098.8s)]
*  They have until like five in the morning right now. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10100.759999999998s)]
*  So like 12 hours. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10102.4s)]
*  They have until five in the morning until they're out of oxygen. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10103.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But what I'm saying is [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10105.08s)]
*  you have to you have to account for how long it would take to [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10107.599999999999s)]
*  get them to bring them to the top and open the fucking thing. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10110.92s)]
*  So it's like they don't have five. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10114.6s)]
*  They don't have to five in the morning. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10116.439999999999s)]
*  They need to be found and on their way to the top for them to have till five. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10118.08s)]
*  And what are the strategies? [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10121.96s)]
*  Is there any article on the strategies they're using? [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10123.76s)]
*  I remember looking that up last night. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10126.32s)]
*  I was even contemplating, do they even have a machine or device [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10127.84s)]
*  or anything that could go even get them besides a drone? Right. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10132.48s)]
*  And I don't know that there even is because most. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10136.439999999999s)]
*  So what the fuck are they doing? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10138.64s)]
*  Are they just trying to find them so they can communicate with them? [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10140.359999999999s)]
*  They're trying to find them so they could use the power of the remote control [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10142.88s)]
*  or to bring them to the surface. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10146.519999999999s)]
*  I don't even think they know where they are. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10148.119999999999s)]
*  I still. Jesus Christ. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10149.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like I think it says that they lost communication [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10151.56s)]
*  like an hour and a half after they. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10153.759999999998s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10155.679999999998s)]
*  So they were they weren't even all the way down then, right? [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10157.0s)]
*  Well, right. Well, they happened right when they hit the bottom. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10159.0s)]
*  The tire voyage is supposed to take two and a half hours. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10164.16s)]
*  The polar prince lost contact with the Titan, [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10166.439999999999s)]
*  approximately one hour and 45 minutes into the trip, [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10168.64s)]
*  triggering desperate search for the now missing sub. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10170.68s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10175.039999999999s)]
*  And I remember the reporter said it was lost for five hours when he went. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10176.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. So. So it happens. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10181.039999999999s)]
*  It has happened. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10184.119999999999s)]
*  What? And they would and they didn't add a transponder. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10186.08s)]
*  They didn't. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10188.72s)]
*  Well, whatever they could have. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10190.359999999999s)]
*  His voyage lasted 10 hours. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10192.0s)]
*  The passengers were given sandwiches and water during that [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10193.88s)]
*  vessels. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10197.76s)]
*  The compass was acting very weird and the passengers had only about 20 minutes [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10198.56s)]
*  to view the Titanic wreckage. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10202.04s)]
*  The compass acted weird. Yeah. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10203.36s)]
*  Bro, imagine if there's an alien ship down there that's fucking them. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10206.16s)]
*  But if your compass going crazy, you need to get the fuck out of there. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10209.16s)]
*  And I don't know. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10211.52s)]
*  I don't know the science of what that means, but that's never good. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10212.72s)]
*  Can't be good. No. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10215.36s)]
*  Some crazy magnets are in there. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10216.48s)]
*  Or some kind of pulse from who the fuck knows? [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10218.56s)]
*  Here's what's so wild about all this shit, though, Joe. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10221.24s)]
*  They went down there to look at the wreckage from screens inside, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10223.64s)]
*  from cameras outside. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10230.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10231.56s)]
*  There was one little tiny hole above the toilet for looking out, [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10233.4s)]
*  but you can't see anything down there. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10236.84s)]
*  Like you have to you know, I mean, it's like that's not their main thing. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10238.44s)]
*  It's like you could have just sent down a drone and watched the screen on ship. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10241.28s)]
*  You didn't have to be in. You don't have to be in the water. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10244.56s)]
*  No, you're down there for no reason. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10246.84s)]
*  Just so you can say you was there. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10249.0s)]
*  You can say you was there. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10251.0s)]
*  I'd have just lied about it. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10252.72s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want to lie about it either. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10254.88s)]
*  About being down there? Yeah, it's just stupid. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10256.8s)]
*  Yeah, but if you're that if you're as an alternative to getting on the motherfuckers. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10258.44s)]
*  If I had to choose. Yeah, I'd lie about it. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10262.0s)]
*  If I have to lie, that's no one's getting hurt by that. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10264.8s)]
*  I'll tell you what I'm not doing. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10266.8s)]
*  I'm not getting on I'm not getting on a I'm not getting on a ship [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10268.32s)]
*  that's piloted by a motherfucker that ain't on the ship. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10271.0s)]
*  Right. The pilot, the driver got to take all the risks I'm taking. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10273.36s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10276.04s)]
*  And also, how about have that ship been able to drive itself, too? [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10277.52s)]
*  Think about this. What what if they got to the. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10281.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, actually, we probably do have the technology where your commercial flight [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10283.36s)]
*  can be flown by a pilot that's that never leaves the city. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10287.04s)]
*  They're flying it remotely. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10290.960000000001s)]
*  I bet they could do that now. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10292.44s)]
*  And then when you get and when you break a certain line, [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10293.480000000001s)]
*  another pilot at the landing city takes over and they land. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10295.320000000002s)]
*  But would you be comfortable with that? No. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10298.320000000002s)]
*  Fuck no. Fuck no. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10300.080000000002s)]
*  Get your ass on this plane. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10301.36s)]
*  You got to be up here with me. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10303.2s)]
*  If you in charge, you got to be up here with me. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10304.44s)]
*  Not only that, why wouldn't they have a system where when they lose [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10306.32s)]
*  communication with the sub, the sub just rises to the top, [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10308.84s)]
*  which has happened before. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10311.44s)]
*  So they've lost communication before. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10312.44s)]
*  And then they had no backup plan for what would happen if it happened again. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10314.92s)]
*  Why does this scare me more than anything else? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10318.279999999999s)]
*  This freaks me out so because you're because you're wealthy [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10320.84s)]
*  and they target wealthy people. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10324.08s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10325.96s)]
*  I'm not. I'm not worried that I would do it. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10327.16s)]
*  Oh, OK. No. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10329.16s)]
*  Just the idea of I have zero desire to do that. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10330.64s)]
*  I'd rather go fishing. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10334.48s)]
*  I don't want to. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10336.240000000002s)]
*  I don't have. I'd rather go play pool. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10337.16s)]
*  I'm not. Bro, the face you baby says zero. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10338.84s)]
*  Zero. I mean, zero. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10341.16s)]
*  Yeah. Not a fucking chance. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10343.400000000001s)]
*  And one of my friends, if you were trying to go, I would do everything that I could. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10345.0s)]
*  Not you. Someone irresponsible, someone crazy. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10349.240000000002s)]
*  I don't even play survival video games. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10351.84s)]
*  Fuck that. No, I've survived my whole life. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10354.400000000001s)]
*  You know, you know these games where you start out in the woods [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10357.960000000001s)]
*  or you have a hatchet. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10360.6s)]
*  They got to build a fire and fire shelter. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10361.560000000001s)]
*  The fuck? Yeah. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10363.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10364.68s)]
*  I'm here to kill demons. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10365.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Fun stuff. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10367.16s)]
*  I'll kill demons with magical weaponry. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10368.4s)]
*  But what is this, Jamie? [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10370.08s)]
*  The device that they have. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10371.12s)]
*  The first thing to come find them today. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10373.68s)]
*  It's called a Victor 6000. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10376.4s)]
*  It can go 20,000 feet, which is plenty to get their butt. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10378.08s)]
*  But what's it going to do? [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10382.16s)]
*  They don't look like it can lift anything. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10382.92s)]
*  I'm looking at like this. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10384.12s)]
*  It shows that they send it out from a ship with some sort of tow rope. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10385.64s)]
*  And maybe they keep the tow rope and maybe then they can hook something onto it [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10388.68s)]
*  and tow them both back up. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10391.960000000001s)]
*  But that's a lot of maybes I just said. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10392.96s)]
*  It's a lot of maybes and they have to find them. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10394.679999999998s)]
*  And they have to find it. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10396.679999999998s)]
*  The amount of area you're talking about is so immense. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10397.48s)]
*  This does have some sort of rope. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10400.919999999998s)]
*  I mean, honestly, knowing that they lost communication almost right [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10402.759999999998s)]

*  Yeah, but this is my thing about the UFO sightings thing. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10469.08s)]
*  It's like, there's too many smartphones out here for us [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10472.76s)]

*  It's very hard. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10488.8s)]
*  True, true. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10489.8s)]
*  I saw a thing the other day where I was like, [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10491.32s)]
*  I can't explain what I'm looking at. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10493.92s)]
*  I don't know if it's a, because it might have been a drone. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10496.359999999999s)]
*  But it just seems so huge and it seemed [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10499.519999999999s)]
*  like it was going up so high. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10501.72s)]
*  But it would have had to have been a commercial drone, [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10504.04s)]
*  not a government one. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10507.400000000001s)]
*  And it kept flying up and then moving to the side [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10508.92s)]
*  and then floating back down. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10512.720000000001s)]
*  And then flying way up to the point when I first saw it, [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10514.04s)]
*  I thought it was a plane. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10516.92s)]
*  But then it started moving completely backwards. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10518.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, well, that's. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10520.880000000001s)]

*  They have this drone. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10544.88s)]

*  Yeah, they're getting very, very sophisticated. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10625.08s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10627.84s)]
*  And then how long after that before they're pilotable, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10629.52s)]
*  where you can get in one of those things [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10632.24s)]
*  and move around in something like that. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10633.76s)]
*  Yeah, and then someone else is flying it. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10635.4s)]
*  And then someone slams into you in the sky. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10637.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10641.72s)]
*  Why are we so fascinated with death? [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10642.84s)]
*  Because it's inevitable. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10645.84s)]
*  And we're afraid of it. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10647.4s)]
*  So we like to get close to it, get a little juice, [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10648.32s)]
*  and then go back to life. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10651.039999999999s)]
*  That's what those climbers are doing. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10653.199999999999s)]
*  Well, have you ever really lived if you didn't almost die? [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10654.92s)]

*  You are still an adult, but you do not [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10660.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10675.32s)]
*  It's sort of a writer. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10675.84s)]
*  I mean, not a writer passage, but it's like, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10677.0s)]
*  if you're living life properly, it's almost inevitable. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10679.32s)]
*  But then you can push it too far, [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10681.76s)]

*  The Alpinist. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10692.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10693.84s)]
*  Is that a tree person? [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10694.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10695.6s)]
*  What is that? [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10697.52s)]
*  What is a tree? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10699.08s)]
*  Oh, the Alps. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10699.76s)]
*  An arborist. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10700.4s)]
*  Arborist, yeah. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10701.56s)]
*  Alpinist is someone who's climbing insane alpine [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10702.72s)]
*  mountains, and this fucking dude was the one [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10705.64s)]
*  that all the other climbers were like, what the fuck? [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10708.8s)]
*  He was just crazy. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10711.439999999999s)]
*  And he, at the end of his life, was climbing ice. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10713.8s)]
*  Is this Netflix? [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10716.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10718.92s)]
*  They always weird looking. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10719.6s)]
*  He was free climbing for all. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10722.279999999999s)]
*  He's an interesting dude. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10723.6s)]
*  He was an interesting dude, I should say. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10725.279999999999s)]
*  Just listening to the recordings of him. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10726.8s)]
*  But he became obsessed with all these top-notch [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10728.64s)]
*  climbers, and he did free solo climbing. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10732.480000000001s)]
*  Then after a while, he started doing ice climbing. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10734.68s)]
*  So he's climbing with these ice picks, and he's [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10737.2s)]
*  making his way up glaciers. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10740.32s)]
*  So he's climbing stalagmites that are hanging off the [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10742.2s)]
*  side of a cliff. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10745.76s)]
*  He's climbing them in the documentary. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10747.2s)]
*  It's so hard to watch. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10749.720000000001s)]
*  Your hands start sweating. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10751.6s)]
*  And did he die doing this? [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10753.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10754.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10754.92s)]
*  And they found him. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10755.52s)]
*  I mean, they know where he is. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10756.36s)]
*  They never even recovered him. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10757.4s)]
*  The glacier just kind of consumed his body. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10758.880000000001s)]
*  But they found where his body is. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10762.080000000002s)]
*  I don't think they recovered him, right? [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10763.92s)]
*  Is that correct? [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10765.240000000002s)]
*  I think that happens with a lot of those guys. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10766.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10768.28s)]
*  It's like you can't even recover him. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10768.68s)]
*  Because to recover him, you would have to risk [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10770.080000000002s)]
*  everybody's life to go recover a dead body. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10771.44s)]
*  A man may be living, though. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10773.480000000001s)]
*  I guess. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10775.320000000002s)]
*  They be living. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10775.84s)]
*  I think a lot of those guys are something wrong with them. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10776.68s)]
*  And that's the way they feel things. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10779.28s)]
*  I think regular life is just flat and boring. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10781.52s)]
*  And the only way they feel is to do [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10784.12s)]
*  something insanely risky. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10785.720000000001s)]
*  I slightly disagree. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10787.320000000002s)]
*  I think some people are just born in the wrong time. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10789.119999999999s)]
*  Like, if we were already at the point [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10795.32s)]
*  where we could explore space, these things [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10796.8s)]
*  would be the starship captains. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10798.519999999999s)]
*  They were the guys that would get on a ship [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10801.199999999999s)]
*  and try to map the globe. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10802.96s)]
*  It was beneficial. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10805.0s)]
*  It's just now we're so comfortable. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10806.039999999999s)]
*  They have to go find and seek out things. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10809.0s)]
*  But their kind of person is necessary. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10811.64s)]
*  Explorers. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10815.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, explorers, people that would take the chances [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10816.08s)]
*  just for the thrill. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10818.16s)]
*  We do need them. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10819.64s)]
*  We just don't need them right this second. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10820.28s)]
*  Yeah, those are those people that would just get in boats [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10821.88s)]
*  and try to find new land back in the day. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10823.88s)]
*  Yeah, those are the people you pay [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10825.96s)]
*  to make the first 100 trips in the timeline [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10827.84s)]
*  to make sure it's safe. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10830.16s)]
*  Imagine the people that made it to the Hawaiian islands [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10831.92s)]
*  in little boats that they made. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10835.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, they came from the Polynesian islands, [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10839.16s)]
*  and they made their way across the fucking ocean to Hawaii. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10841.52s)]
*  They were like, oh, we hit the jackpot. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10846.36s)]
*  Oh my god, they hit the jackpot. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10848.12s)]
*  But they did that shit thousands of years ago. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10850.12s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10853.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was some ballsy ass people out there. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10855.68s)]
*  Ballsy ass people. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10857.68s)]
*  Fucking yeah, real balls. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10858.68s)]
*  You find out an island in the middle of the ocean [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10859.76s)]
*  is a bunch of cool ass people living on it. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10862.84s)]
*  And the thing is, when you take off, [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10866.04s)]
*  you don't know where you're going [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10868.44s)]
*  and how you'll survive when you get there. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10870.480000000001s)]
*  Talk about people that are in touch with nature. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10873.28s)]
*  People that live in Hawaii. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10875.720000000001s)]
*  You're very vulnerable out there. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10878.4s)]
*  Isolated. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10881.08s)]
*  Any other nature people fascinate me. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10882.36s)]
*  People at home, out in the wilderness. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10885.0s)]
*  Because they're right. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10888.880000000001s)]
*  The doomsday prepping people, they're right. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10890.4s)]
*  They're just not right right now. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10892.720000000001s)]
*  But it's coming to an end at some point. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10894.68s)]
*  It might not even be while they're alive. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10896.68s)]
*  But those are gonna be the people you're looking for. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10898.52s)]
*  You ever watch Last of Us? [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10901.56s)]
*  Yes. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10903.0s)]
*  The old gay man with the shelter is like, [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10904.32s)]
*  yeah, if the apocalypse comes, [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10906.04s)]
*  they're gonna be sitting pretty. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10908.28s)]
*  Yeah, and the rest of us are gonna be like, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10909.92s)]
*  why if I ... [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10911.68s)]
*  Yeah, but then those people go after those people. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10912.84s)]
*  People who weren't prepared. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10915.52s)]
*  They try to find the people that aren't prepared. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10917.04s)]
*  What's interesting is preppers, [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10919.32s)]
*  a lot of times, get lumped into terrorists. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10920.68s)]
*  They get labeled. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10923.16s)]
*  Like there's this guy, Mike Glover, [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10924.08s)]
*  who's been on my show, [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10925.84s)]
*  who runs this company, Fieldcraft Survival, [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10926.68s)]
*  and he teaches preparedness for all kinds of different things. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10929.8s)]
*  They had him labeled. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10933.76s)]
*  They had him on the list. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10934.84s)]
*  Like an extremist list. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10936.44s)]
*  Because he's just telling people, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10938.199999999999s)]
*  if society collapses, he's a special operations soldier. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10940.48s)]
*  There's probably some crossover [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10945.44s)]
*  between the two communities. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10946.88s)]
*  You probably don't ... [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10948.76s)]
*  Because it's already so few of you, [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10950.279999999999s)]
*  I would imagine if you're like ... [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10952.0s)]
*  Somebody walked up and was like, [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10954.16s)]
*  hey, fucking John is in the clan. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10955.0s)]
*  He's like, but just don't bring our brace around John. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10956.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10959.88s)]
*  He's one of our best preppers. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10961.0s)]
*  I don't think they're talking about that. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10962.24s)]
*  I think they're talking about people [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10964.44s)]
*  that want to overthrow the government. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10965.56s)]
*  Oh, okay, so I get what you're saying. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10967.08s)]
*  Malicious. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10968.32s)]
*  People that want society to collapse [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10969.16s)]
*  are mixed in with the people that are preparing [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10971.68s)]

*  Yeah, and the worry is that ... [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10974.48s)]
*  Well, from the prepper's perspective, [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10977.36s)]
*  the people that are into that would say, [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10980.039999999999s)]
*  I don't trust the government not trusting me. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10982.119999999999s)]
*  Because what they don't trust me [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10984.64s)]
*  is that if the shit goes down, [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10985.92s)]
*  they go full totalitarian. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10987.44s)]
*  They know we're armed to the tits, [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10989.0s)]
*  and they don't like it. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10991.0s)]
*  Unless we have food, we have water, [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10992.4s)]
*  we can fucking, we can huddle down [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10993.92s)]
*  and fight them off. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=10998.84s)]
*  That's what they think, I would imagine. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11000.44s)]
*  And just espousing that puts you on a watch list. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11002.72s)]
*  Or even if it was like zombie shit, [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11006.68s)]
*  or some disease, or ... [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11008.32s)]
*  Like, bro, you know the ... [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11010.52s)]
*  And I might just be talking my ass. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11013.28s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, please, Jamie. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11014.52s)]
*  But the premise of Last of Us was that one fungus that ... [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11016.04s)]
*  Corticeps. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11021.080000000002s)]
*  Corticeps, it couldn't infect humans. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11021.92s)]
*  And then it did, right? [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11023.84s)]
*  And now it has, in real life. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11024.880000000001s)]
*  Has it really? [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11027.640000000001s)]
*  I just read this a couple weeks ago. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11028.480000000001s)]
*  Am I wrong, Jamie? [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11030.36s)]
*  It has infected a human now. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11032.480000000001s)]
*  Really? [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11034.52s)]
*  Yeah, now obviously I don't know [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11035.36s)]
*  if it can mind control a human. [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11036.36s)]
*  Because you'd probably die before it could take over [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11039.0s)]
*  your whole mind, because our minds are way bigger [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11040.880000000001s)]
*  than bugs. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11042.480000000001s)]
*  But there's things that take over our minds anyway. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11044.400000000001s)]
*  There's toxoplasmosis, which you actually get from cats. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11046.480000000001s)]
*  You might have that. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11049.640000000001s)]
*  There was a pussy plant out there. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11050.64s)]
*  From your wild cat? [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11052.48s)]
*  You probably have it. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11053.4s)]
*  You probably have toxo. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11054.48s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11055.68s)]
*  Just from being exposed to cat feces? [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11057.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11058.76s)]
*  Yeah, that bitch, she rubs her butt all over everything. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11059.6s)]
*  Not only that, she's out there with rats [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11062.439999999999s)]
*  and all sorts of things. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11064.039999999999s)]
*  Who knows what she's killing and eating out there? [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11065.039999999999s)]
*  I think it makes you love them, right? [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11066.6s)]
*  Well, what it does with rats is it makes them [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11069.039999999999s)]
*  sexually attracted to the smell of cat urine. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11071.64s)]
*  Okay. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11074.16s)]
*  They literally lose their ability to be afraid of cats, [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11075.0s)]
*  and then they get hard, thinking about cat piss. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11077.6s)]
*  So they get aroused. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11080.92s)]
*  So they literally seek out the cats, [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11082.12s)]
*  and then the cats kill them and eat them, [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11085.0s)]
*  and toxoplasmosis actually multiplies inside a cat's gut. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11086.52s)]
*  Could cordyceps fungi infect humans? [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11092.880000000001s)]
*  Cordyceps opiocordyceps are types of fungi [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11095.08s)]
*  that typically affect insects. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11100.720000000001s)]
*  Fictional works have explored cordyceps infections [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11102.08s)]
*  in humans, but this fungus is not likely to evolve [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11104.44s)]
*  to cause infection in humans in the near future. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11108.44s)]
*  However, cases of fungal infection [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11109.960000000001s)]
*  may be increasing with climate change. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11112.2s)]
*  This is recently, April. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11114.6s)]
*  Did I speak out of my ass? [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11116.2s)]
*  Uh-oh, misinformation. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11117.04s)]
*  No worries, it happens. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11118.48s)]

*  You know what scares me is rabies. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11123.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah, well. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11126.24s)]
*  Rabies is wild. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11127.32s)]
*  You hear about the accounts of settlers [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11128.36s)]
*  trying to make their way across the country [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11130.880000000001s)]

*  Rabies is wild because it infects animals [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11136.08s)]
*  and makes them wanna bite you to give you rabies. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11138.32s)]
*  Yeah, and every time I hear somebody tell me [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11142.68s)]
*  they got bit by a wild animal [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11144.48s)]
*  and they didn't go to the hospital, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11145.8s)]
*  I'm like, are you crazy? Oh my God. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11146.72s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking mind? [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11148.16s)]
*  Because once you start showing symptoms of rabies, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11149.08s)]
*  yeah, you already dead. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11151.52s)]
*  You don't have much time. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11152.48s)]
*  I think you have to get to the hospital [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11153.92s)]
*  and get treatment within 24 hours. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11155.32s)]

*  Yeah, unless you're bleeding out [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11254.48s)]
*  or you're having chest pains, it's not serious. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11256.519999999999s)]
*  So you might be sitting in there for four, five, six, [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11258.88s)]
*  seven hours. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11261.519999999999s)]
*  You got to fake a stroke. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11262.359999999999s)]
*  You just got to say, you're not having chest pains. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11263.48s)]
*  Just getting dizzy, I'm blocking out my chest. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11265.16s)]
*  It don't get me wrong, I wouldn't do that. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11267.039999999999s)]
*  If I thought something serious was wrong, [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11268.96s)]
*  I would lie about having chest pains. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11271.16s)]
*  I have no shame in my game. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11273.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good move. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11274.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11276.199999999999s)]
*  You got to get in there, [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11277.039999999999s)]
*  especially if you think it might be rabies. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11277.859999999999s)]
*  I strayed Fred Sanford in there. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11278.699999999999s)]
*  I'm coming home Elizabeth. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11280.88s)]
*  Everybody forgot about that. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11285.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11286.88s)]
*  That's a great show, man. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11287.72s)]
*  Because I did it before. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11288.539999999999s)]
*  I went to the emergency room when I was having chest pains. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11289.38s)]
*  It was on the 4th of July. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11294.88s)]
*  And I remember the dude taking my vitamins and stuff. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11296.599999999999s)]
*  He was like, how old are you? [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11299.359999999999s)]
*  I was like, 40. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11300.199999999999s)]
*  He was like, and just walked away. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11301.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, I was the only person in there. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11304.88s)]
*  They saw me right away. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11307.56s)]
*  He laughed? [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11309.08s)]
*  He laughed. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11309.9s)]
*  You were having a heart attack at 40? [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11311.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he laughed. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11312.46s)]
*  What a piece of shit. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11313.3s)]
*  I know, right? [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11314.14s)]
*  Wow. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11314.98s)]
*  He took my vitamins and was like, what's wrong with you? [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11316.22s)]
*  I was like, chest pains. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11318.06s)]
*  He was like, for real? [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11318.9s)]
*  I was like, yep. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11319.74s)]
*  I was like, all right. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11320.58s)]
*  Walked off. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11321.42s)]
*  Wow. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11322.26s)]
*  I know, the doctor was pissed when I told him that. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11323.1s)]
*  But he was like, it's just unlikely [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11325.22s)]
*  that there's anything wrong. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11326.42s)]
*  It turned out to just be gas. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11327.78s)]
*  It's real bad gas. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11329.22s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11330.18s)]
*  How bad's your gas? [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11331.02s)]
*  That particular time, it was just real bad. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11332.22s)]
*  You went to the doctor for gas? [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11336.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11337.86s)]
*  Yeah, like it hurt real bad. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11338.699999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11341.58s)]
*  Like you were really thinking you were having a heart attack. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11342.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11343.26s)]
*  Well, the thing is, the VA has a telonurse. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11344.1s)]
*  So if you call the nurse and say your symptoms, [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11347.14s)]
*  they'll tell you what you need to do, [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11350.34s)]
*  whether you go to the hospital, [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11351.58s)]
*  they'll make an appointment for you or whatever. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11352.5s)]
*  But if you say you're having chest pains, [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11354.34s)]
*  they're gonna make you go to the hospital. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11356.6s)]
*  No matter what the fuck is going on. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11358.74s)]
*  So they're like, best not to risk it. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11360.94s)]
*  So it probably wasn't the type of pain [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11363.7s)]
*  that would be signal of heart attack. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11366.14s)]
*  But it was like, she didn't know that [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11368.1s)]
*  and I didn't know how to describe it to her better. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11369.900000000001s)]
*  So she just go just in case. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11371.5s)]
*  You don't wanna be going to the emergency room just in case. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11373.460000000001s)]
*  But I would if I got bit by an animal. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11375.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11377.1s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta be careful. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11379.980000000001s)]
*  You can't fuck around. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11381.220000000001s)]
*  You don't wanna die and wish you had gone. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11382.26s)]
*  Right, chest pain or animal attacks, it's a must go. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11384.26s)]
*  Yeah, no matter what's gonna cost you going to the doctor, [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11387.86s)]
*  just don't pay it. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11389.54s)]
*  You know, I'd rather be alive and in severe debt [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11392.900000000001s)]
*  than dead, cause I didn't go to the doctor. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11395.300000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11397.42s)]
*  Medical bills are fucking crazy. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11399.94s)]
*  It's kind of insane. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11401.82s)]
*  It's very, very, very, very much insane. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11404.980000000001s)]
*  I didn't really understand until the pandemic. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11406.78s)]
*  I never looked into the healthcare system [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11409.980000000001s)]
*  in terms of like how many hospitals are private. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11412.460000000001s)]
*  Most of them. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11415.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're businesses. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11416.74s)]
*  And then the public ones are dangerous. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11418.26s)]
*  Everyone in this, everyone in every city, [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11422.060000000001s)]
*  they could tell you the hospital [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11423.74s)]
*  that you don't wanna go to. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11424.82s)]
*  You know, my mom, she's probably mad [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11426.78s)]
*  me talking about this. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11429.86s)]
*  My mom had a heart attack recently, [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11431.58s)]
*  and like, you know, within the last year. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11434.380000000001s)]
*  And she drove herself to the hospital [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11436.02s)]
*  because, cause she lives in DC, [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11438.54s)]
*  but it's right there on the border [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11440.78s)]
*  with PG County, Maryland. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11442.5s)]
*  And so it was based, it was because she knew [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11445.380000000001s)]
*  if she called 911, they would take her to the bad hospital. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11448.300000000001s)]
*  So she drove herself to the hospital. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11451.18s)]
*  So she could go to the hospital. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11452.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11453.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11454.58s)]
*  It's like that out here. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11455.98s)]
*  The public hospital is fucking trash. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11457.22s)]
*  I saw a video of a kid who's severe, [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11460.58s)]
*  is one of the worst fractures of an ankle I've ever seen. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11462.66s)]
*  And he's in the passenger seat, [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11465.46s)]
*  being driven to the hospital. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11466.98s)]
*  It is, it's not- [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11468.82s)]
*  In the passenger seat of what? [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11470.1s)]
*  His friend's car. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11471.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably faster than taking someone in an ankle. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11473.26s)]
*  Yeah, but he's just, I mean, [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11475.66s)]
*  I don't know what else you do, obviously. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11478.1s)]
*  Do you get leeway if you're driving somebody to the hospital? [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11480.1s)]
*  Like, say you speeding or something [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11482.22s)]
*  and they pull you over. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11483.539999999999s)]
*  If the cops are listening to you, [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11485.22s)]
*  you said my friend's got a broken ankle, [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11486.099999999999s)]
*  the cops would probably give you a police escort. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11487.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they'd probably go, broken ankle. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11489.58s)]
*  I mean, if it sounds pretty bad, [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11491.42s)]
*  like bone through the skin and shit, blood everywhere. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11493.3s)]
*  But is there some kind of signal you can give [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11496.22s)]
*  where like, I'm not slowing down, I can't stop? [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11498.3s)]
*  Cops would never listen, [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11500.019999999999s)]
*  because they have to follow you anyway, [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11500.859999999999s)]
*  just to make sure it's true. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11501.699999999999s)]
*  Otherwise you're just a psycho, just speeding around. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11503.019999999999s)]
*  Oh, right. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11505.14s)]
*  Saying you're pregnant. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11505.98s)]
*  I was like, you gotta beat me to the hospital. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11506.82s)]
*  I'm giving birth, sir. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11507.939999999999s)]
*  Excuse me? [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11510.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11511.66s)]
*  What happens if a cop pulls someone over [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11512.5s)]
*  and they say I'm giving birth now and it's a guy? [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11513.62s)]
*  I've seen a cop. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11515.740000000002s)]
*  You have to let it slide. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11516.58s)]
*  A cop let one of my cousins get away [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11517.42s)]
*  with just pissing on the side of the road. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11519.900000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11521.78s)]
*  Because he pulled him over, he was like, [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11522.62s)]
*  why are you speeding? [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11523.460000000001s)]
*  He's like, I gotta piss so bad. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11524.300000000001s)]
*  And he got out of the car and ran over [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11525.7s)]
*  and he let him piss. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11526.900000000001s)]
*  He's like, you know, sometimes you gotta go. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11527.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11529.62s)]
*  Yeah, we've all been there. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11530.460000000001s)]
*  Did you see this story? [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11531.62s)]
*  What's this one? [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11532.460000000001s)]
*  It's from Florida. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11533.300000000001s)]
*  Oh, a deputy pulled another deputy over. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11534.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I thought he was in a stolen car, [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11536.300000000001s)]
*  but it was not. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11537.7s)]
*  He was just saying, I'm on my way to work. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11538.54s)]
*  He's like, well, why are you going? [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11539.660000000002s)]
*  He's going 85 and a 45. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11541.699999999999s)]
*  He just walks off. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11543.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I think technically, [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11544.58s)]
*  because cops don't follow the same traffic code, [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11548.099999999999s)]
*  but I think if you're not on shift, [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11550.619999999999s)]
*  you can't just, just because you're in a cop car, [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11552.779999999999s)]
*  you can't speed. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11554.74s)]
*  Right, you have to be going to a scene. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11556.06s)]
*  Or you just have to be on patrol. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11558.66s)]
*  And yeah, but you're still not allowed to speed. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11559.9s)]
*  Like, you're not supposed to speed [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11562.66s)]
*  unless you're chasing someone. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11563.619999999999s)]
*  If you're going to a scene of a crime, interesting. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11564.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think he got fired for that, but. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11567.98s)]
*  I gotta wrap this up. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gobHGmLMj6c&t=11570.5s)]
