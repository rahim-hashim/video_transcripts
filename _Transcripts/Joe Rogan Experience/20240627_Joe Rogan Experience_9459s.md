*  What's going on Joseph. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=21.14s)]
*  The Smokin' Joes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=22.14s)]
*  That's us, dude. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=23.14s)]

*  It's been fun having you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=25.7s)]
*  Two nights in a row. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=26.7s)]
*  Yeah thanks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=27.7s)]
*  Three nights. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=28.7s)]
*  Well, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it was their Monday. Yeah, but yeah, it's been awesome [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=29.7s)]
*  I mean, obviously everyone tells you everyone says it it's one of those things [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=33.62s)]
*  I wanted to be the guy that was like, I don't know. It's not so great. But no, it's fucking awesome [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=38.1s)]
*  No, we did it right. What an atmosphere. Yeah, great green room. I mean, that's the only green room [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=43.14s)]
*  You can smoke cigars in that's not true. There's some I was just in Nashville at Zanies and the manager was very nice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  He was like you can smoke a cigar if you want. Oh, yeah, Zanies is great [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=53.1s)]
*  But I was like, I don't think I'm doing smoke a cigar in the green room numbers [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=56.18s)]
*  You know what? I mean? I'm like I gotta add a couple shows before you're lighting a fucking stick in the green room [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=60.74s)]
*  I think I think when we were in England, they told us that if you smoke inside, it's like a severe fine [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=65.74s)]
*  Like something like really crazy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=72.38s)]
*  So you can't even smoke in the green room in England if you do like shows, right? Yeah [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=74.66s)]
*  I mean mostly I don't like smoking indoors because it just you fucking stink and the secondhand smoke can bother me [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=79.32s)]
*  but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  Your green room is like really well ventilated. Yeah [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=86.62s)]
*  You see this big vents in the ceiling in that place when you go in there [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=89.34s)]
*  Do we set it up on purpose? Yeah people could smoke in there. No, I like when you can just watch the smoke [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  Just go straight out. You're like, this is nice. Yeah, cuz some of the comic smoke cigarettes and you know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  And [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  You know, you want to suck the air out, you don't everybody be subject to it [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=106.18s)]
*  It's a wet dream in there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=109.62s)]
*  Have you had anyone get too fucked up where you're like dude you gotta cuz I think about when I was drinking if you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=110.94s)]
*  Just had whiskey and booze was like help yourself [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=116.52s)]
*  There's got to be a few people that are gonna be problematic at some point. Everybody's been keeping it together so far [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=119.66s)]
*  Okay, we'll see see as the crowd grows. I'm interested [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=124.58s)]
*  It feels like a kind of thing I come back in a year and it's like behind [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=128.14s)]
*  It's there's a safe with all the booze in it and they're like, yeah fucking so-and-so came in and ruined everybody [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=131.02s)]
*  Nah, I don't think there's that many of those super off-the-rail guys left [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=135.42s)]
*  I think that's a good point. My wife and I talk about this a lot, but I think maybe because we're older though [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=140.66s)]
*  I'm sure there's a bunch of comics in their 20s that really get after it. Yeah, I bet that's true [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=145.82s)]
*  Yeah, we just probably don't know them. I'm thinking like established comics like because there was like established comics [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=151.22s)]
*  When I was coming up there were like national headliners that you just knew were off the rails [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I actually think it's very difficult to sustain [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=164.5s)]
*  Boozing that hard and be successful [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=169.18s)]
*  Most of it was coke was what I when someone was like an off-the-rails guy like completely out of control [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=171.18s)]
*  It was booze, but it was a lot of coke right we ever a coke guy. No, no me either. Yeah [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=177.1s)]
*  I was too afraid of snorting a thing and then no one ever said good things about coke to me until later [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  I heard every once in a while, but mostly people were like, I don't do coke [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  It makes you crazy your hearts gonna explode like people didn't sell cocaine to me [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=191.7s)]
*  Well, it just didn't seem like the people that I saw doing coke are going anywhere [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  It seemed like it was tripping up their life pretty bad, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  Right. I was very fortunate that when I was in high school [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=203.62s)]
*  My friend his cousin was selling it and his cousin got addicted to it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=206.22s)]
*  and I watched this guy go from being like a normal guy to being this like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=210.5s)]
*  person who just like hung out in this attic apartment and lost all this weight and just like [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  This did coke and watch TV and sold coke and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=218.38s)]
*  It's like you got bit by a vampire. Yeah [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=222.1s)]
*  Wow, I'm always afraid my heart is gonna explode even without doing coke like I said like my heart will raise them [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=224.34s)]
*  I'm just so paranoid about heart. Just does heart shit ever fuck you up [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=230.76s)]
*  Like mentally that fact that your heart beats every second or whatever for 80 years and if it stops, that's the end of it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=234.62s)]
*  That's how it works. Joe this I know but does that ever like trip you out a little bit? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=242.62s)]
*  I'm not I mean, I don't want to sound like it's fucking crazy man, but I'm like that's nuts. It is nuts [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=246.38s)]
*  Yeah, and if it stops you're dead and if you get a transplant, it's a motherfucker [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  they're trying to do pig transplants now, they did it on this one guy and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=257.94s)]
*  One person I don't know if it was a girl or a gal or a non-binary folk [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=262.58s)]
*  Like a fisher folk, but they they did it and the person stayed alive for a short amount of time [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=267.26s)]
*  I think was a couple weeks. So they just jammed a pig heart in there. It's a modified pig heart [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=273.4s)]
*  Somehow or another pig parts and human parts apparently are like super similar [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=278.4s)]
*  Yeah in some way I've fucked a few pigs [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=283.28s)]
*  Was it say here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=289.64s)]
*  How long did the man with a pig heart lived he lived for 61 days? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=292.0s)]
*  That's not bad. That's not bad research and working on the new pig to human transplantation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=295.4s)]
*  Technique for over 30 years if successful harvesting harvesting hearts from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=300.12s)]
*  Genetically modified pigs whose genes have been altered so they could be safely transplanted to humans may one day be a reality [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  I think on the way to that though. I bet they're gonna like 3d print hearts [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think you know as scary as AI is I think all our problems are over dude. We're gonna be [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=318.44s)]
*  Making hearts and brains and all kinds of shit to the matrix eat and steak [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=324.96s)]
*  I'm gonna be an important person Joey pants. Yeah, we're gonna be great [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=329.04s)]
*  I'm a perfect eyesight and a strong jawline by the end of the year. I think [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=333.16s)]
*  You're not gonna stop there. You're gonna look like he man. I'm gonna go buy a fucking big [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=337.24s)]
*  Superman you're gonna go the Hulk [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=343.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't you you want to be a fucking human when you give you a superhero if you can genetically alter yourself? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=345.68s)]
*  To make yourself more like masculine and thick and bigger and stronger [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  Why would you stop at 3? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=356.0s)]
*  We can go to 26 right? I don't think I could be more masculine, but I do feel like I would like yeah some more [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=358.72s)]
*  girth and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=366.52s)]
*  If that could be done genetically though, where would you stop? That's the question, right people would get ridiculous [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=368.08s)]
*  It's like when people don't I mean, I'm sure you've seen those Instagram videos of people with fake butts walking on the beach [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=373.6s)]
*  Yes, they just went so far. It's like what this is great [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=380.52s)]
*  You're gonna die that stuff can't be good for you. What is that? Yeah, I see it all the time [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=384.24s)]
*  It just you just look imbalanced. It doesn't look looks good. It looks insane [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=388.36s)]
*  It's an insane look [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=392.32s)]
*  but my point is like if they can do that with genetics if it ever gets to a point where the mold of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=393.6s)]
*  What we think of as the human physique has been completely thrown out the window because now we're gonna alter it from its very core [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=399.6s)]
*  To be a completely different structure. It just changed what a person looks like people gonna be giants if they're gonna be dragons [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=405.56s)]
*  It's gonna be fucking real-life cosplay, right? Do you think anybody will be like I'm sticking with this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm going long and thin and there's gonna be a few people that pretend for a little while [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=417.72s)]
*  Well, there's the same folks that say I don't even have email. Fuck you right you got email now bitch [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=422.72s)]
*  You know like in 2001 you might not have had email, you know, but I bet you have it now [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=428.56s)]
*  Yeah, well you have to have it now. I feel yeah, you kind of have to have it now. I [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=434.0s)]
*  Enjoy email [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=438.56s)]
*  That's my take well, it's certainly better than not having email [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=440.96s)]
*  I mean people like well in the privacy and they're hacking your email and they're sending you these scams and yep [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  Yep, that's what comes with this new thing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=451.84s)]
*  Well, I just had a friend who works for some business that was getting I don't know all the detail nor would I share them if [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=454.84s)]
*  I had them but their company was getting sued or something and then they just accessed his emails and now they have a hundred [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Percent of his email so he was saying like don't ever email a fucking joke like hey [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=467.64s)]
*  I'm gonna kill that guy or anything because they have it like you should do we should do all phone communication [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=473.72s)]
*  Maybe they're listening to phones do I don't know but yeah, I'm sure they are [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=479.68s)]
*  I think they didn't lock that down quick enough and when [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=482.12s)]
*  Edward Snowden exposed the the NSA's gigantic sweeping [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=488.2s)]
*  surveillance [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=493.6s)]
*  Sort of thing and it's all under the guise of stopping terrorism, which by the way, you fucking never hear about anymore [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  What happened at terrorism? We nailed it climate change took the spot of terrorism. Well, we stopped it Patriot Act worked, baby [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=501.1s)]
*  It must have we did we did it must have otherwise they'd be talking about it [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=508.6s)]
*  We done did remember when after 9-eleven there would be a threat level like our code. Yeah today's code is yellow [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=512.24s)]
*  It was like forest fires. Okay, we're good. Yellow's good, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=519.04s)]
*  You know, I have to bring a bulletproof vest of Starbucks. Yeah, it was scary as fuck. It was like they really [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=523.02s)]
*  Got to us, but they nailed that terrorist attack. I mean they knocked it out of the park. So [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=529.98s)]
*  It was certainly in it was like one of the all-time great terrorist attacks in terms of publicity [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=534.66s)]
*  Yes of like how it affected the world. It's gotta be number one, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=540.02s)]
*  Yeah, but just a crazy thing that an action like that changes your rights forever changes everybody's rights forever [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=544.42s)]
*  But don't you think someone was just debating this somewhere? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=551.54s)]
*  It doesn't it feel like COVID feels like it changed life more than 9-eleven like 9-eleven [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=554.7s)]
*  It's now like shoes and you can't at the airport and you can't go to the gate [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=560.38s)]
*  But other than that, it doesn't really feel that different whereas COVID does feel different [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=565.18s)]
*  We're like cities have emptied out and people still wear masks and six feet. It's just much more [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=571.1s)]
*  Life feels more different after this than it did 9-eleven in my well because COVID got everyone to comply [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=578.06s)]
*  COVID got everyone to do things that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=584.7s)]
*  Whoever was on television was telling you to do right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=587.54s)]
*  But it's be it became a different thing where there was an experimental medication [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=590.5s)]
*  And you were encouraged to take it and if you took it you wanted other people to take it, too [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=595.78s)]
*  Right. There's a fucking thing that people do when they do something [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=600.06s)]
*  They want you to do it too and especially if they can connect what they did with doing the right thing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=603.34s)]
*  They want you to do it. Sure people do that with everything they do that with yoga class [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=608.86s)]
*  You don't think they do that with vaccines. No, I think this all the time in New York where you see [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=613.82s)]
*  People one person starts crossing the street while the light is green and literally the entire [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=619.02s)]
*  Herd starts following them and then a car comes like fucking and then they have to jump back because they were just watching that one person [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=623.9s)]
*  Yeah happens all the time people go in well, that's also cell phone brain too, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=630.3399999999999s)]
*  Because people are constantly checking their oh we're walking now and they just will walk. Yeah [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=634.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the did you know I heard this recently that gum sales have gone down [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=640.02s)]
*  Gum and candy because people are looking at their phone in line at like CVS instead of just staring at you know [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=645.66s)]
*  They have the gum and candy underneath the register [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=653.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I I don't know if I read it or heard it but like [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=655.78s)]
*  Before you'd be staring going. Oh man, I could go for a Milky Way [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=659.02s)]
*  But now instead you're looking at you know, a pigeon that I think makes sense. Yeah, so [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=661.78s)]
*  Yeah, that really makes sense [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=667.9399999999999s)]
*  Of course. Yeah people just want that's that's a new distraction. I wonder if it's the same thing at the supermarket when those stupid [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=670.02s)]
*  Tabloids one of their selling less I would imagine so who's buying that now. Well, they have tabloids built into the phone [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=678.02s)]
*  Yeah, no also like the stories aren't outrageous enough [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=684.26s)]
*  Right [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=688.7399999999999s)]
*  What's like real online? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=690.02s)]
*  It's it's mostly fluff pieces because you have to get celebrities to agree to do them [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=692.06s)]
*  Like, you know us and people and all those right? I'm blown away by we were talking about this before you got here [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  Like I'm grateful. I'm not into this dark web [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=702.5799999999999s)]
*  My algorithm is all like baseball and Martin Scorsese [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  I didn't like Duncan Trussell last night was talking about some crazy shit [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=709.5s)]
*  he sees on the internet like children shooting each other and then I was on your mom's house and they were like showing videos of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  Dicks being peeled back and inserting [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=718.62s)]
*  cushions into dicks [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=721.9000000000001s)]
*  Cushions or what? I don't know something where they put do you know what it is? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=723.5s)]
*  They they had some guy had a big pad under his hand. They're putting I [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=727.14s)]
*  Don't even know what it is. Like [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=731.7s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? Jamie like they were put under his hand. Yes [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=734.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know the terminology like people put like horns on their dick. It's some kind of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=738.68s)]
*  Yeah body [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=744.92s)]
*  What is body modification? Yeah, one guy had like it looked like a spider on his palm or whatever the fuck this is [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=747.04s)]
*  Yeah, they do they give themselves horns and shit. Yeah. Yeah bumps all over their head [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=753.68s)]
*  I don't know what made me think of that. Oh just that those videos exactly. I wasn't getting those I feel so naive [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, did you see this Tommy Lasorda saying motherfucker video and other people are looking at dicks being [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=763.2800000000001s)]
*  altered [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=770.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you can get in the wrong algorithm on Instagram, it could be quite disturbing and I'm definitely in the wrong algorithm [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=771.84s)]
*  We gotta get you back. You know, I don't think I can't get back [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=778.2800000000001s)]
*  I think they have me now because if they send it my way [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=780.86s)]
*  I'm gonna look at it because it's all there's so many murder videos [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=783.96s)]
*  Well, I feel like I just was saying this recently like it took me a long time to really get got [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=787.24s)]
*  By the algorithm like I was kind of like I don't know what that is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=793.2s)]
*  But they finally figured me out and it's like behind the scenes baseball sports shit people talking shit in the locker room [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  Or that and like and filmmakers breaking down, you know Kubrick or whatever, you know, John Boy [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  You know that guy on YouTube. No, I don't. Oh, he's awesome. Yeah, it's a great hole to go down [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=809.2s)]
*  We were talking about it before he lip reads all these baseball fights and argument [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=814.2s)]
*  The Empire manager fighting each other a professional lip reader and he's hilarious and there's a million video you got to see it [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=819.12s)]
*  JOM boy, he's you'll love it get in that algorithm because he's awesome, but it's fucking hell [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=825.84s)]
*  That's like my childhood prayers have been answered [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=831.6s)]
*  You always watch the manager Empire scream and you're like, what the fuck are they saying? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=833.76s)]
*  Right and they probably swear horrible shit each other. Oh, it's all cocksucker and mother fuckers cocksucker and cocksucking this and horseshit [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=836.72s)]
*  The other big one [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=844.32s)]
*  And I've been trying to get those in my life more bring them back cocksuckers fun cocksuckers fun [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=846.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, he's always used as a term of affection [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=851.7600000000001s)]
*  What's up cock like hey cocksucker? And when he said it it was fun [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=855.12s)]
*  Well, you are bringing joy if you're sucking cock you are but he's not saying it in that way [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=860.0s)]
*  And so there's other ways like words have different meanings like if some you catch someone [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=867.48s)]
*  Stealing your tire. Mm-hmm. What's up cocksucker? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=874.6s)]
*  Right. It's a different one. Sure, but Joey Diaz calls you up. What's up cocksucker? You're like, what's up? Joe? Hey, yeah, it's very sweet [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=879.12s)]
*  It's all a different. Yeah, it's also the word, you know the word can be a term of affection [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=886.44s)]
*  I'm not really a call a guy stealing my tire a cocksucker kind of guy. I'm a big 9-1-1 [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=893.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna wait for hours [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=900.84s)]
*  Well, I'd call the police and you know, see what happens yeah, I mean turns out what kind of guy it is, right? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=902.5999999999999s)]
*  I might be able to fuck him up. What if it's Duncan? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=908.76s)]
*  Dressel. Yeah, what does he have a tire iron? It's good because that's a weapon. It's good point. Yeah [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, where is the tire iron positioned because the tire iron is positioned on the actual lug nut itself [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=917.64s)]
*  You're an advantage right? I could probably get take his back as they say [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna smash him before he gets to that thing now do you let me ask you this if you see a guy [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=929.64s)]
*  He's crouched down. He's fucking with your car and you're behind him [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  Are you going blunt force to the head or you're gonna take his back and choke him out? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  Depends on how big the guy is. Hmm depends on the situation [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=942.4399999999999s)]
*  You get the you hit someone with shoes on it's really tricky legally [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=947.72s)]
*  Hit someone with shoes on. Yeah, I mean them or you you hit them with your shoes. It's kind of a weapon really [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=951.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think they look at it differently [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=958.04s)]
*  I think even if like you had like these things on like hokas like Ryan sneakers [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=959.64s)]
*  Uh-huh. I think it's still a weapon which is ridiculous because it's actually way softer than if I hit you with my bones [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=963.0799999999999s)]
*  So you're gonna take your shoes off to kick a guy? No, no, but I'm saying like whether I would hit him [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  While they're doing that I'd probably say something first and see how they react [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=973.9599999999999s)]
*  But be ready to hit them because it feels like though if you if you fucking [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=979.48s)]
*  Punch a guy or kick a guy as hard as you can he might have a strong jaw and he got [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=983.54s)]
*  But I feel like choking a person. Yeah choking works most of the time unless the guy knows how to fight [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=988.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what if he has really good defense and you realize that immediately and you forgot to put the second hook in because you were [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=994.38s)]
*  Trying to stand up right then also he spun towards you and you know [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=999.38s)]
*  Oh my god, he's trained and he gets an underhook and they trips you now [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1003.5s)]
*  He's on top and you're in fucking half guard on the concrete and he's headbutting you and he's gonna tie right [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1006.72s)]
*  That was an old joke. I tried doing about my level of fighting is if the person's cooperating I can beat them [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1013.14s)]
*  Here it is any job object made or adapted for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury can be considered a deadly weapon [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1018.38s)]
*  For example a shoe or a shod foot used for kicking may be considered a dangerous weapon [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1026.26s)]
*  That's dangerous or deadly though, right? Because someone can we saw [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1032.94s)]
*  Was that movie where? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1037.78s)]
*  Fuck was the curb stop movie Oh [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1040.3s)]
*  American history X right? Yeah, you can that was like two weapons [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1045.54s)]
*  That was a curb was a weapon too and then there was the boot that was unsettling [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1049.7s)]
*  What is a shod foot for those of us unfamiliar? I had to check it is a shoe or a foot with a shoe on it [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1054.06s)]
*  So so what about flip-flops? What have you kicked someone you're wearing flip-flops that a shod foot? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1060.02s)]
*  No, it was you kind of at a disadvantage with flip-flops on we're gonna have to go to the judges on that one [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1066.78s)]
*  Or a slipper [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1072.82s)]
*  I think it's it might be anything on your foot because it goes back into his shirt talking about people that were almost always [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1073.66s)]
*  Barefoot so that would be an unshot foot [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1078.86s)]
*  I feel like it should be shoeed fit. I feel like that was a shoeed foot [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1085.06s)]
*  I feel like that was a typo somewhere and they just went with it shod shod foot. Is that a word shod? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1088.34s)]
*  Yeah, it means with the shoe it means you're there's a shoe on your foot. Yeah, I mean that should be shoot [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1094.3s)]
*  I mean, this is easy. This is obvious [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1099.46s)]
*  Don't you think should be shoeed? What's like is it shod? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1101.7s)]
*  Do you know the mound to home plate is 60 feet six inches because it was a [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1104.54s)]
*  They did it with pencil and the second one was supposed to be 60 feet even but the six the zero looked like a six [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  That's why it's remained 60 feet six inches. Yeah. It was like a not a typo a fucking a righto [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1115.5s)]
*  Whatever the whatever you call it, right? I feel like that was shod. I feel like they just left the E off should I [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1121.1s)]
*  Think it's more like a proper English thou shalt not thing. That's gay. You know I'm saying [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1127.1799999999998s)]
*  Your feet are shod [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1134.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. I like it. I'm gonna say shoot. I think it's a proper thing [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1136.8999999999999s)]
*  shot is a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1142.6999999999998s)]
*  Middle English see meaning put shoes on or provide with a shoe [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1144.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's thanks [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1149.74s)]
*  Shod sucks [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1151.74s)]
*  What's weird that we have English words in England that are spelled different than the way they're spelled in America [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1153.74s)]
*  Yeah, there's still you see like there's old ol de town with an E and there's tires with a Y [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1161.74s)]
*  Oh, I don't know that one and then the color with a U. Yes color [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1168.02s)]
*  Flavor there's a few of those. Yeah. Oh, yeah [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1172.74s)]
*  There's a few of those yeah, oh, yeah, but it's like the same language like why you guys fucking with the different words [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1175.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. What are you doing on the left side of the road, bitch? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1181.42s)]
*  Yeah, we invented the car get the fuck over on the other side. I heard it was from jousting. Is that something? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1185.22s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it does supposedly have you ever driven on out there. I [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1190.98s)]
*  Have not I've done it a few times. It's a thrill [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1196.66s)]
*  It I would imagine it would be a little bit nerve-racking to be on the wrong side of the road. It is I got great advice [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  Is that the driver is always in the middle of the road. That's really helpful [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1204.82s)]
*  it's like you're [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1209.34s)]
*  You're closer to the middle than the other end which is the same here and there. You know what I mean? No, like you're on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1210.9399999999998s)]
*  The right side of the car but the left side of the road in England [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1218.58s)]
*  So you're if you look out the window the middle of the road is right there [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1222.4199999999998s)]
*  The line is next to you and reverse here in America. You're on the left side of the car [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1225.46s)]
*  But the right side of the road so you look out the window. Yeah, so that's helpful [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1229.3s)]
*  But I've only ever done it with one other like my wife in the car because you need a second person to be like don't [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1232.74s)]
*  forget [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1238.02s)]
*  Driving alone. I feel like I could fuck it up [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1239.22s)]
*  Yeah, you could fall back into the pattern and also and see yourself in the oncoming headlights. Yeah, I think that's what happened to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1241.9s)]
*  Matthew Roderick. Yeah [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1249.3s)]
*  It's also like the just the shifting and everything if you're operating a manual shifting now with your left hand instead of your right [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1252.86s)]
*  That would be bizarre. No, I couldn't do that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1260.46s)]
*  I have a friend who's like a big driver guy [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1262.98s)]
*  He said that was the one thing he couldn't do because it was just too many things [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1264.9s)]
*  Yeah, because is the clutch still on the left-hand side it is so it's clutch brake [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1269.42s)]
*  Accelerator all in the same order, but now you're doing this and then which side do you do it? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1274.7s)]
*  Do you start far left or you just start far right and move that way? You don't do that, do you? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1279.9s)]
*  That's what's weird, right? Yeah [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1286.14s)]
*  If you're operating a manual transmission and you're in the the English side [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1288.14s)]
*  Where's first gear is first gear up into the left? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1293.5400000000002s)]
*  That is a great question. No, it's probably closer to you up into the right [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1296.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine the thing that would they would have to do that would be a really hard to do I think [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1305.8600000000001s)]
*  for transmissions [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1310.9s)]
*  one of the hardest part for me was I kept putting the windshield wipers on with the blinker because you're just you're used to the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1312.3000000000002s)]
*  Blinker being over here. So every single fucking time I would turn the windshield wipers on. Yeah, I [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1318.26s)]
*  Love a good windshield wiper stock. That's one thing that bums me out about my Tesla. What's a stock? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1323.14s)]
*  It's a little stock little thing that does the windshield wipers a little thing [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1329.1000000000001s)]
*  You know little thing that sticks out of the steering wheel little thing. Oh, I'm thinking of the windshield wiper itself [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1333.98s)]
*  The little does the blinkers you don't have that [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1339.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a button everything's this yeah buttons buttons on the steering wheel to change lanes [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1342.7800000000002s)]
*  There's buttons for a horn [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1347.82s)]
*  Now it's fun to have the physical. Yeah [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1349.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going right. I'm going you know, come on. Sometimes I reach through and grab it over here [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1352.98s)]
*  I just you can you got options. I like going like this [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1358.22s)]
*  It feels like you're doing like an alt comic [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1364.7s)]
*  Yeah, but isn't it normal feeling till I hit the blinkers and turn right? Of course, it's satisfying [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1367.14s)]
*  Did you do it you do that thing before you turn you don't press a button on your steering wheel? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1371.86s)]
*  It feels ah, it feels every time like don't fuck this up [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1376.58s)]
*  I was this car for two years and every time I press oh, yeah [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1379.74s)]
*  Sometimes I'll press the left button when I meant to press the right button like fuck [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1383.1799999999998s)]
*  I would love if you did exactly this on stage and the crowds like what? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1386.74s)]
*  Just just a total crickets like a really bad Seinfeld a copy of a Seinfeld bit great set last night [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1392.26s)]
*  By the way, I went up to the balcony and watched it. Very funny. Thank you. I know you know that but [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1399.1s)]
*  Thank you fun night [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1403.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was awesome. It was it's so fun to run back and forth to the two rooms and there's such different kinds of rooms [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1405.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that little room is magic and you've become great like a comedy [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1411.1s)]
*  Like pilgrimage I ran into like first of all, I felt like a fucking celebrity out in Austin from those shows [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1415.82s)]
*  I bumped into two guys from Calgary that came just to see the room [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1420.84s)]
*  then I sat next to another guy at a restaurant that was from Montreal who came just to see the room and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1424.5s)]
*  Then I met another guy who was from England just [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1429.86s)]
*  Fucking walking around I was fucking around with the crowd last night. There's people from Australia. They're people from all over the place [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1433.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's a destination. Yeah, yeah [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1440.02s)]
*  Comedy pilgrimages people they just want to see the room. It's fun. I hope more people do things like this other places [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1442.86s)]
*  Did you ever go on any like when you before you started like I gotta go see or when you started I gotta go see [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1450.46s)]
*  Fucking whoever you're on a road trip to go see a comic like make a comedy. Yeah fan trip [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1457.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah a couple of times. I mean in the early days I went to see a bunch of comics but Kinnison [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1463.06s)]
*  I went to see Kinnison a couple times. Yeah. Yeah, I was like [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1469.46s)]
*  89 80 89 and the problem is it was like Kinnison had already sort of deteriorated [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1476.46s)]
*  So it was a kind of a bummer it's like we were talking about you can't go that hard and keep being productive [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1483.5s)]
*  It feels like yeah, it was pretty evident that [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1488.62s)]
*  It was not the same kind of insight that you had from his earlier work his earlier work wasn't just wild [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1492.82s)]
*  It was wild and like that's a really good point. Yeah, you know, it was wild and like wow [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1500.02s)]
*  This is this is like great writing. This is like [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1506.66s)]
*  Interesting subject matter and you got this wild dude and then the stuff about marriage was so funny [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1509.74s)]
*  It was so like obviously the guy had been in fucking terrible agony and heartbreak [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1516.14s)]
*  It was so obvious that people had broken his heart, right, you know, and then you bought into it hook line and sinker but [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1521.3400000000001s)]
*  from that special from so he has his [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1527.78s)]
*  First thing which is louder than hell, which is a cassette and it's really fucking good. It's hard to get [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1532.42s)]
*  I got an album of it. Okay [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1538.18s)]
*  I think you can get it some places, but I think I don't know there was some controversy with it [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1540.46s)]
*  It's it's there's a lot of like very homophobic stuff in there. But then it goes from that to [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1545.78s)]
*  The HBO special and I think that have you seen me lately it's called and [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1552.8200000000002s)]
*  The the HBO special is fucking amazing. I mean, it's amazing. It's just so good [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1559.0600000000002s)]
*  There's so many good bits of it and then the one after that's not it's just flat it just feels fake [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1564.58s)]
*  It feels like he's a guy trying to imitate Sam Kenison. Yeah, I feel like that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1571.02s)]
*  I mean I would never name name but I feel like that happens sometimes with comics where they have [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1575.6599999999999s)]
*  great material in a very unique way of doing it and then they kind of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1580.5s)]
*  Start to lose the material and just have that unique way and the the marriage of the two is what made it great [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1584.5s)]
*  I think it's hard to write [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1589.5s)]
*  When you're partying all the time [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1592.46s)]
*  absolutely going to events and you're you're the guy in the Bon Jovi video and you're this and you're that and you're [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1594.94s)]
*  You know, I mean his whole life. He was this like weirdo and this preacher and then [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1601.26s)]
*  he gets in the comedy and [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1607.26s)]
*  Becomes one of the greatest of all time and then all of a sudden he's a fucking [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1609.7s)]
*  superstar in the rock and roll days of like poison and guns and roses and like [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1614.02s)]
*  Whoa, and he's the rock and roll comic, right? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1620.42s)]
*  You know, so he's like singing on stage now like brings a guitar on stage. Do you ever see some of that? Yeah [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1622.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah that song wild thing. Yeah vaguely. I never was a huge Kenison guy. I wasn't big into the the screaming [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1628.26s)]
*  I I mean, I always find that comedy doesn't hold up great most comedy which is what makes comedy great to me [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1635.98s)]
*  So I think by the time I saw it I was like a kid and just like didn't quite understand it [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1642.2s)]
*  And then later I was like, I don't know. Hmm. I mean I respect Kenison obviously [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1646.38s)]
*  He just wasn't one of my guys for me [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1650.0600000000002s)]
*  It was like catching it in the actual context of the time of 1980 [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1651.6000000000001s)]
*  Whatever it was when he when he popped right I want to say it was 86 [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1656.38s)]

*  When he was coming up it was [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1691.86s)]
*  developing material [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1693.94s)]
*  Like it's coming up with like really good unique bits that would make you this superstar [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1695.54s)]
*  Once we got a superstar was like poisoned for that right that way that's what's so hard about [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1701.9s)]
*  Getting so big is that people are like yeah the guy and see it's so hard to balance [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1707.02s)]
*  I imagine I'm not in that position, but I mean you're pulling it off. It's um, I [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1712.1000000000001s)]
*  Mean you just can't you can't buy into the bullshit, right? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1718.18s)]
*  That's you can't be fucking partying with Bon Jovi and rock and roll every night. It's like you think you're not gonna get anything done [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1721.66s)]
*  Yeah, you need an amount of humility it also feels like that [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1728.7s)]
*  Feels so removed from what makes stand-up great as a guy standing there telling jokes [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1732.22s)]
*  It's like now you have a guitar and a gang and women and drums and you're like, well, that's not really like look at Chapelle [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1736.9s)]
*  He's doing it the right way [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1743.02s)]

*  Just starts going up goes up at the end of shows [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1749.82s)]
*  Practices fucks around right and then next next night a little fuck it fly to this place or that place [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1752.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, those places and fucks around writing always working on new bits. Yeah, always turning over material [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1757.82s)]
*  No, you got to do it. Now. Do you still listen to sets? Do you record? Yeah, I record all of them [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1764.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I own myself a few listens though [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1768.1s)]
*  I've been slacking off especially the bottom of the barrel listens. Those are the ones you really got to listen to yeah [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1771.38s)]
*  That's a really fun show. I'm like it makes me uncomfortable, which is why it's fun to do [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1776.52s)]
*  You like if the people don't know I guess you the audience writes down shit and you just pull them out [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1781.9s)]
*  Yeah, you have a barrel and the audience writes down suggestions for for topics and then you just reach in the barrel pull it out [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1787.74s)]
*  And start riffing. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. It was super fun. Yeah, that's not I don't do a lot of that [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1794.7s)]
*  So it was fun to get in that spot and yeah, that was that was great that room fucking rules the smaller room [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1801.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's a honest little room [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1807.3s)]
*  They were they were fucked up last night. It's a super intimate room. Yeah, it was great [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1810.1s)]
*  They were they were it felt like a 1 a.m. Spot last night the late show. No, it's the early one [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1816.78s)]
*  Oh, really? They were fucked up on the early. They were jacked up [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1822.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of those ones where like you say something and then they kind of break into conversation a little bit [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, are you all right? What are you guys know? Like oh, no, we're good. Like they're I'm in the way [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1828.8600000000001s)]
*  But they were fucking great and it was really fun getting stuff out of them because a room that small if people are kind of [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1833.82s)]
*  Chatting or chuckling you can deal with them more [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1841.3400000000001s)]
*  You're in a massive room and somebody's yelling or talking from the back you can't really deal with it [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1843.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if you're in a theater and that's happening, it's a real problem exactly in a comedy club. You can pause and go [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1848.26s)]
*  What are we doing? Yeah, yeah, like a real dialogue with them [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1853.06s)]
*  But you don't want to that's the thing [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1856.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like we've got to train people to just not talk out loud [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1859.1s)]
*  Just like you don't do in the movie theater [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1862.42s)]
*  Don't do that a comma comedy club and don't talk to the comedians either don't just talk at them [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1864.22s)]
*  Well, do you do you think I mean, what do you think about all these crowd work clips? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1868.98s)]
*  Don't you think we're breeding this? I feel like it's a very bad situation [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1872.66s)]
*  It's not a bad situation because it's just how they do it some people do it that way [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  But it makes the audience want more of that. I was talking to my nieces just went to college and she has a roommate [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1880.48s)]
*  Who's like 18 years old? She's like essentially a high school kid and she knows she was like, what do you think of crowd work? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1885.98s)]
*  and I'm like, it's so crazy that like teenage kids are like Oh crowd work like [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1891.9s)]
*  Well, because those are the clips you could put online because it doesn't burn your material, right? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1896.42s)]
*  Because it's a unique moment, right? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1900.6200000000001s)]
*  But sometimes I feel like this comics going up there just trying to get those moments [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1902.98s)]
*  They definitely are annoying and then the audience thinks like oh, I'll be part of this [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1907.34s)]
*  well, there's comics a little tricky to you go see their actual act and [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1910.82s)]
*  You know the thing about crowd work is it's always funnier when you're there of course [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1915.24s)]
*  But it's always funnier because everyone knows it's happening live and you don't know what's gonna happen in either as a comedian [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1920.54s)]
*  They know it's completely improvised. Well, that's why it works [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1927.52s)]
*  So because obviously comedy is about getting everybody to be like, oh, yeah, and if they're seeing it live [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1930.24s)]
*  It's just happen good point. So but to Paula used to always say that, you know work with Nick for years and he'd be like [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1935.76s)]
*  Oh, you're funny off the cuff. Yeah, that's called a fucking being funny. That's easy write some material you fuck [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1941.6s)]
*  Yeah, if you can do both, that's great, right? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1947.32s)]
*  But some people only do one or the other right? Yeah, but there gets yeah, there's there's tricks to it [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1950.84s)]
*  You definitely don't want to encourage people to interrupt people who don't do count crowd work though [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1957.6s)]
*  And that's where it becomes a problem people are drunk and they think I'm gonna get on a video [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1961.8799999999999s)]
*  Right, you know that kind of shit does happen now. How do you feel about? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1966.48s)]
*  MCs in New York, which is the only city that does this where the MC goes up and just asks everybody where they're from and does [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1970.84s)]
*  Almost exclusively crowd work. They never did that in Boston when I was starting or and they didn't do it here in Austin [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1977.2s)]
*  Really? Why do they do that in New York? I [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1982.08s)]
*  Don't know it's a New York like New York comics they think that's what the MC does [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1984.56s)]
*  I think part of it is to find out where everyone's from because there's so many tourists [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1988.52s)]
*  But most MCs in New York [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1992.56s)]
*  Just do a lot of crowd work and I've heard people even be like I don't like hosting cuz I'm not I don't good do [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=1995.6s)]
*  Crowdwork and I'm like, well, you don't have to just fucking does anybody not do crowd work. Does anybody just go up and say hey [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  What's up, everybody? How you doing? We tell you about my day. I don't think so [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2005.78s)]
*  Really when I hosted this years ago when Artie Fuqua got in the accident [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2010.44s)]
*  They needed hosts at the cellar [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2015.04s)]
*  so I volunteered and I hosted for like six weeks and I felt like I was the only one that just went straight into material which [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2016.36s)]
*  I think is better because I [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2022.6399999999999s)]
*  find [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2024.84s)]
*  The audience if they're you know when they're they're settling in and ordering and getting their drinks and whatever [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2025.96s)]
*  Figuring out who's sitting where if you look up and the comic is talking to somebody they're going. Okay, it hasn't really started yet [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2032.56s)]
*  He's talking to that lady, but if you look up in their middle of a bit, you're like fucking quiet the show started [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2037.88s)]
*  That's how I always felt [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2042.72s)]
*  mmm, yeah [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2044.72s)]
*  The problem with someone talking to the audience is it does kind of encourage the audience to talk to some of the future comedians [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2046.88s)]
*  If they have a point that the person disagrees with or if they're getting to a point and you cut them off [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2053.48s)]
*  Because you could say something, you know, sometimes like guys will mislead you with a bit. What is he saying? Oh [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2059.92s)]
*  Ha ha ha but some people jump in in the middle of it, right and fuck it up [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2066.72s)]
*  Exactly, and they think they can because someone's been talking to them in the audience exactly [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2072.48s)]
*  Yes, and they're like, oh, this is a dialogue. I got it. Perfect [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2077.2999999999997s)]
*  Exactly, or it gives them an opportunity to be outraged and now this is kind of encouraged to give feedback [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2080.72s)]
*  It's encouraged to talk right? I also think that the audience needs to hear [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2087.48s)]
*  The rhythm of a few jokes, but to me it's like if you do crowd work for five minutes and then do ten minutes [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2094.56s)]
*  Of jokes, but sometimes you have an MC where you're like I am if you're going first [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2099.24s)]
*  You're like I'm now the first one telling a joke, which is no good. I think the audience needs to hear like, oh, okay some bits [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that definitely would set everybody else up for the rest of the night and that's really what the MC should be doing [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2110.0s)]
*  But some kind of a tell would get annoyed because a tell always wants to know where everyone's from so he would ask me like [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2115.3599999999997s)]
*  Where are they where are they from? And I was like, I don't know [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2120.24s)]
*  And you can see that he was like what like and there's nothing worse than upsetting of tell [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2122.92s)]
*  It's a weird I know the New York has this one thing where everybody goes and asks the fucking audience member where they're from [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2128.6800000000003s)]
*  It's very strange. They're like, what are you doing? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2135.92s)]
*  We're seeing a comic one time and made me laugh so hard the audience member made me laugh so hard because the person was like [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2137.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you what are you doing? And they're like, I'm at a show. What do you mean? What am I doing? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2142.7200000000003s)]
*  They're like I'm on a date I don't get it I just never to me it's like [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2148.4s)]
*  We're supposed to be doing a show. I don't get why I don't I don't care what the audience is from or what they're doing [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2153.08s)]
*  I always felt like that style came out of the fact that [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2157.68s)]
*  The comedy clubs in New York when I was coming up. They were all very intimate. They're very small [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2161.28s)]
*  Yeah, like Boston comedy was very small catch rising star was small [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2166.02s)]
*  the cellar small and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2170.04s)]
*  Because you're like right on top of people and they're packed in and there's not that many of them [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2172.16s)]
*  I felt like it's more intimate the stage is smaller and I think it's sort of [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2176.3599999999997s)]
*  Led comedians to want to kind of like personalize everything. Yeah. Yeah, which I feel in this small [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2182.7599999999998s)]
*  Room. Yeah at your club. What's it called? Little boy little boy [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2189.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I do instinctively start being like you ever had you ever had this because it does feel like you're at a hang [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2193.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're hanging right which is really nice [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  Like if you're doing material because it's just like you you're you're real intimate in that room that move [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2201.4s)]
*  You're you're on top of those people. Yeah, I feel like you could shoot a special in there [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2207.4s)]
*  Or maybe someone already had I think somebody shot one in the big room. David Lucas just shot a special in that little room [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2211.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's that's a fucking killer run Brian. Did he shoot something at your shot something big room? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2216.2000000000003s)]
*  Brian Simpson blew me away last night. He's a layer by the way. I always knew he was funny [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2221.44s)]
*  But I like it's so rare you get to sit and watch comedy and I sat in the balcony watching [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2224.76s)]
*  I was like this guy's like next level the balcony's the shit, isn't it? It's not unbelievable [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2229.58s)]
*  It's awesome when we first were walking around the building when it was its bare bones [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2233.46s)]
*  We're standing up there in the balcony [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2237.62s)]
*  one of the first things we're thinking like, you know badass it's gonna be to be just sitting up here chilling and [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2239.34s)]
*  like watching Chappelle go on stage and so [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2244.38s)]
*  When it actually happened when we were there the week it opened Dave came by and we're watching him [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2249.22s)]
*  I'm standing on the balcony. I'm like, dude [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2255.96s)]
*  I looked at Tony Hinchcliffe and I go this is like exactly what we imagined [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2258.06s)]
*  It was the exact thing that we imagined. That's an unbelievable feeling. I don't want to sound [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2262.46s)]
*  Gay, but we're very lucky people that we've lived a life where he's like I imagined this and then did it happen [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2268.34s)]
*  it's oh, yeah, super super lucky, but also like [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2275.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a good thing. Like when I was thinking about doing it, I didn't want to do it [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2278.5s)]
*  I'm like this is too much work. I don't want to be involved in this [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2283.2200000000003s)]
*  I always told comedians be really nice to club owners because we need them and you don't want to be them [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2285.6s)]
*  Right. We need them. We need someone to own the club. We need a place to go [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2290.64s)]
*  We need who would want to deal with some of the the maniacs that we knew. Yeah, this is it. Oh wow [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2294.12s)]
*  That's the little boy. No, that's the big room. That's that's yeah, that's the balcony. Yeah. Wow, that's killer [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2300.64s)]
*  Yeah, so that's before the concrete had been poured. It's you know [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2306.2599999999998s)]
*  Those guys are standing on foam [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2310.48s)]
*  So there's a foundation under that and then they'd put these massive blocks of dense foam and [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2313.48s)]
*  Then on top of the foam then they lay more of that rebar and then pour concrete [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2319.88s)]
*  It's crazy what they did because it was basically set up like a movie theater like tiered steet [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2325.56s)]
*  You know stadium tile. Yeah proceeding and we lifted the floor up and it made it flat [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2331.36s)]
*  So how did it work? Did you like I feel like I'm interviewing you know, but I mean how did you? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  Just explain the vision to a [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2341.92s)]
*  Amazing architect [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2345.64s)]
*  Richards an amazing architect and one of the things about Richard is he's also a musician. He's an artist [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2347.4s)]
*  He's like he has an eye for things he sees things and he totally got the concept of it [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2352.8s)]
*  and so when we [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2358.0s)]
*  We had looked at another building. I told you about the place that was owned by a cult [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2360.0s)]
*  So we had that place and then that one fell apart and then when that fell apart [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2364.72s)]
*  It was really hard to find another spot and [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2368.84s)]
*  This place wasn't for sale. It was all they only wanted to lease it [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2372.0s)]
*  I was like I'm not gonna do that like I need to be able to own it. That doesn't make any sense like and so [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2375.56s)]
*  Fortunately they changed their mind and they sold it to me and when they sold and one of the things they liked was that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2384.08s)]
*  you know 6th Street a lot they're making a lot of like apartment buildings and high rises and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2389.32s)]
*  They loved that effect. I was just gonna keep it a live entertainment venue [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2394.92s)]
*  Yeah, and because it's an all in 1927 theater, you know, Stevie Ray Vaughn played there the 80s [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2397.96s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the poster killer fucking bands [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2404.64s)]
*  Now did you were you drawing sketches or you just saying this is what I like it [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2407.16s)]
*  Richard did everything but Richard wise [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2410.76s)]
*  We we went over it [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2414.0s)]
*  We had a structure right because there was a Alamo draft house had been there before and we also had [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2416.0s)]
*  We had a big advantage in that Richard had redesigned the Alamo draft house [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2422.28s)]
*  So he was the one who was in charge of that project [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2426.16s)]
*  So he knew the whole bones of the building because they converted it from like I think was a rock and roll club [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2428.96s)]
*  Previous to that and then they turned it into the Alamo draft house [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  And so they had to build a kitchen that it built these rooms [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2438.7599999999998s)]
*  They had to you know set it up from the movies and do everything so he knew [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2441.68s)]
*  Exactly where everything was and so we had two rooms in one building which I really like [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2446.08s)]
*  Because I wanted a smaller more intimate room and a bigger room [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2451.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so when we saw it we just had to address like, okay [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2454.04s)]
*  How do we do this and we we had a bunch of different ways of looking at it? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2459.36s)]
*  We always agreed that the projection room would be the green room [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2463.52s)]
*  Like that makes the most sense [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2466.48s)]
*  It's in the center of the two rooms and it gives you the option of just literally walking there and seeing one room [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2468.08s)]
*  Are going this way to the balcony and seeing the other yeah [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2473.0s)]
*  So that was like that was a no-brainer and then we blew the walls out so it connects to the balcony and we set [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2475.56s)]
*  Everything up and moved all the equipment out [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2481.6s)]
*  We had old projectors in there and shit and then we built everything out and then in the process of building everything out [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2484.32s)]
*  I had Louie come and look at it and Louie had some amazing advice [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2491.4s)]
*  He gave me some great advice about shrinking the size of the stage in the little room lowering the ceiling even further in little room [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2496.08s)]
*  Was like a low ceiling. He's like, can you get it lower? Yeah, I'm like, yeah [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2502.7599999999998s)]
*  I think we can get it lower like me like a foot or two lower, you know [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2506.16s)]
*  So we did that and then in the main room the same thing [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2509.9599999999996s)]
*  He said lower the ceiling and so the ceiling drops so you have you know the balcony [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2512.8799999999997s)]
*  You can see how the ceiling drops when you look out the balcony [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2517.5s)]
*  So you just see like the top of the stage, right? I decided to be a great idea [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2520.52s)]
*  I mean it would cost billions of dollars to have a comedy club that you could move the walls in depending on the crowd size [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2523.9199999999996s)]
*  You know how like there's like a curtain but you wish you could just fucking [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2530.0800000000004s)]
*  Physically move the wall to tighten it up because obviously comedy just works tighter. Yeah, I mean that's not it's an impossibility [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2533.1600000000003s)]
*  This is my fantasy. I mean, it's not an impossibility. I don't know it's an impossibility [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2539.1600000000003s)]
*  You just have to have walls that were on tracks and you'd have the tracks built into some sort of an some sort of an engine [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2543.6000000000004s)]
*  Moved them back and forth, but it'd probably be stupid. It would take up way too much room [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2551.0s)]
*  You know, how are they powered of a diesel generated or the electric manpower everyone gets behind the audience [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2557.76s)]
*  Pushes the wall in yeah [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2565.0s)]
*  It would have to be that because of it what it was some sort of a computer would malfunction and kill everyone [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2566.44s)]
*  It would just compress the entire audience like fucking Star Wars. Yeah [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2570.46s)]
*  Imagine if you have a sold-out show and someone hits the hundred seat button [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2575.4s)]
*  People just stacked up on top of each other in the middle of the fucking room [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2580.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a great episode for like one of those what do you call it? What's that fucking? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2583.74s)]
*  Show black mirror or twice thing on a Twilight Zone, but yeah same same same shit [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2588.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what I was wondering though if you could just you just explain to the architect what I look what it looks like [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2596.62s)]
*  Because this blew my mind a while ago. I was watching like some Springsteen behind the album thing [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2600.62s)]
*  I don't know if it was the river or darkness or whatever [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2606.74s)]
*  But I never knew there's a scene where Bruce is talking to Clarence Clemens and it's just like it should sound like this [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2609.1s)]
*  And he's just do like mouthing the sound of the saxophone which in my mind [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2617.02s)]
*  It's like Bruce is writing musical notes or something. You don't picture a guy just being like it should sound like this [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2621.8199999999997s)]
*  And then the guy does it it kind of was like wow, you know, it blew me away [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2628.58s)]
*  But there's a lot of musicians don't read music. No, I think like most and it's funny [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2632.54s)]
*  I took mandolin not most but many rock musicians [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2637.26s)]
*  I took mandolin lessons years ago and it was fun [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2640.6200000000003s)]
*  And I thought I wouldn't be able to read music because I'm I'd always hear like Eddie Vedder can't read music and Bruce Spring [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2644.36s)]
*  And it turns out it's not that hard. They just didn't feel like learning it like in my mind [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2650.1000000000004s)]
*  I was like these geniuses can't do it and then the lady was like no you can they just didn't want to learn how to [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2654.6200000000003s)]
*  Read music. It's just it looks like a weird alien language when you see all the musical notes and everything like to me [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2659.38s)]
*  They register as nothing. Of course. I like I've seen people with musical notes tattooed [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2665.3s)]
*  You know like they have like a strip of like music line and like the musical notes around [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2671.1200000000003s)]
*  Could be Nazi stuff, of course [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2676.82s)]
*  It's crazy and I've seen I have friends that are like world-class musicians and it's what crazy to watch them [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2679.34s)]
*  Just read a thing and play it. It's like a [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2685.52s)]
*  Magic trick. I hate to do this, but I just got an IV before this one have to piss already. Oh piss [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2688.5800000000004s)]
*  What do I do? Do I just you can be too or just hang out? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2693.1s)]
*  No, I just feel like I'll be all fucking jacked up fucking up you drink caffeine though, right? Yeah, I'm a green tea guy [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2697.74s)]
*  Are you a coffee guy ever or just a green tea guy? No, I've never been a coffee guy [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2704.68s)]
*  I had I had one cup of coffee in my life and it was in Peru [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2708.86s)]
*  I was on [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2713.56s)]
*  Vacation in Peru and we're in like this coffee field and this guy was like people fly from all over the world to have this [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2714.7s)]
*  Coffee and I was like well, I gotta have it. I'm in Peru and I was like, this is the worst [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2719.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just not a coffee guy, but as I get older it smells very good [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2724.1s)]
*  So maybe I would like it but I like green tea and mmm, you know green tea is nice [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2728.06s)]
*  Very nice coffee is one of those weird things that people call an acquired taste [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2732.54s)]
*  And I don't know why anybody would ever want to acquire a taste [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2737.7s)]
*  But if I beer was like that, but then you first had beer were you like nice? I was like, this is fucking shit [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2741.2599999999998s)]

*  Like spit it out only drinking it to get fucked up. Yeah, but then don't you didn't you acquire a taste for it? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2752.1s)]
*  Like an IPA you're like nice delightful. I don't like IPA's as much I like a cold ale [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2757.18s)]
*  You know like a cold ale on a hot day, you know like fish and chips, of course [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2763.98s)]

*  I would drink this one. Nobody drinks soda tea [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2775.42s)]
*  Right at tea temperatures, right but I mean you can get a warm soda and you're like furious [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2778.46s)]
*  I mean, I wonder what it would taste like if you microwaved your soda [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2783.84s)]
*  Like if you had a coca-cola and you do it nuked it up to put it in a teapot. Does it? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2787.7s)]

*  It's mostly water and and and heated it to [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2797.22s)]
*  Oh [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2801.1s)]
*  The thing was going off and then you poured it in your cups and just drank hot coca-cola [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2802.3s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, it's not I've soon it would lose its fizz, right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2808.22s)]
*  Of course it would but imagine if we just invented something awesome and nobody thought to do it ever until just now [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2812.06s)]
*  We might have done it. Has anybody done that before? It must be YouTube videos. So I'm reading right now a [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2817.24s)]

*  It transforms into a light refreshing soft drink into a thick sweet tea [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2828.62s)]
*  mmm [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2834.3s)]

*  It's like that's one of those memories that you have to like stop pushing the memory guy to find it [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2885.48s)]
*  He's like I can't find it. I can't find it. Okay, I'm gonna leave you alone. I'm gonna leave you alone [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2890.58s)]

*  And then you go yeah, you gotta let go or it doesn't work. Sometimes that spin you're not getting any traction [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2898.76s)]
*  It's like when you get stuck in stone like [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2903.76s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, you're gonna blow out your transmission settle down, right? Let's let's figure this out. It was an Alan Watts [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2906.96s)]

*  Drinks that like traditionally are just warm or cold. That's it [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2933.2s)]
*  But coffee you can be both. It can be both same with water. You can have an ice water [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=2938.64s)]

*  Cornerstone of the neighborhood. It feels like it just felt like it was supposed to happen [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3176.82s)]
*  Like while you're in there and it even like people ask me if it was stressful [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3181.5s)]

*  Didn't do a lot of big drugs. I bumped into a friend of mine at skankfest and he was like I'm on acid right now and in my mind [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3398.24s)]
*  Acid you're not like oh, hey, it's Joe list. How you doing? I'd picture like there's a fucking lizard walking at me [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3406.08s)]

*  What depends on the dose right you know you can get some serious reality dissolving doses sure [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3413.88s)]
*  I think of acid is like you go in the woods or you look at the Jefferson Airplane video or whatever not you're walking around [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3420.38s)]
*  A festival communicating with yeah, you could you queue up? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3425.84s)]

*  Just fun to do but it's crazy that it works [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3433.2400000000002s)]
*  Roger water said there's it's total coincidence. Yes. I mean it seems coincidental, but it's fucking cool. It's insane [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3436.6400000000003s)]
*  How good it is like when you sync it up perfectly? Yeah, it really does seem like it's a soundtrack to the movie [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3443.96s)]
*  It's a lot of fun great album great film, but how does something like that happen where the synchronicity is so perfect I? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3450.6600000000003s)]
*  Don't know why do you have a theory? I don't think it's just worked out that way [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3458.52s)]
*  I think there's more to the world than physical things I [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3462.9s)]
*  Really do I just think we're skeptical of that because we can't measure it [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3469.92s)]
*  I think there's more to the world that there's more connections in the world than we would like to imagine because I think they'd be [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3473.86s)]
*  Overwhelming, but I think there's connections with your very mind. I think your mind in the world [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3480.92s)]
*  Interact with each other in a way that changes the world and changes your mind. I think I [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3487.88s)]
*  Think sometimes there's like evidence of that in just these weird unique ways like [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3494.4s)]
*  two ideas converge together and even though it's [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3501.56s)]
*  Completely coincidental that Pink Floyd and the Wizard of Oz [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3505.72s)]
*  You know you do was it dark side of the moon right? Yeah, but they sync up absolutely perfectly, but maybe it's not [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3510.84s)]
*  But maybe it's the universe saying look [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3516.56s)]
*  Look at this little cute little Easter egg look at this cute little tidbit [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3519.7200000000003s)]
*  We're showing you that this is not a logical universe like there's some weird stuff to it super weird stuff [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3524.2400000000002s)]
*  But doesn't some of it also feels like the confirmation bias like you're told these go together [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3530.4s)]
*  So you're watching and they do feel like they go together, but some of it [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3535.36s)]
*  You're like oh the lion and that sound, but you're kind of just listen. Let's play it [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3538.6000000000004s)]

*  connected with [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3547.96s)]
*  Wizard of Oz [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3549.52s)]
*  When you actually see like I used to think that too like all these hippies are trying to find fucking connections and anything [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3550.64s)]
*  Fucking potheads, you know trying to be skeptical and then I watched I was like oh, oh my god. This is crazy [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3556.68s)]
*  I mean, I haven't done it since high school, but it was fun [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3562.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's also interesting who the first person to do it was I'm sure that information right is somewhere [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3565.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, but when you actually see it the connection is insane. It's so good [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3569.64s)]
*  It really does seem like that's what happened like they made it for it [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3574.52s)]
*  Wizard of Oz rules great film. What's the last time you watched it? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3579.68s)]
*  One of the funniest scenes ever is when the cowardly lion runs and jumps out of a fucking window [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3583.08s)]
*  It's like one of the great comedic scenes. He's scared of the wizard and he fucking runs and dives out the window. It's very funny [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3587.12s)]

*  This is like a part of it. That's all we do here. I [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3603.68s)]
*  Thought it started later. No, this is where it starts. This is just where it cuts in [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3609.72s)]
*  This is this is time which is the time yeah, and this is perfect too because it's such a great song [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3613.48s)]
*  I love that. This is the TBS version [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3628.24s)]
*  But look at the way the sound ends the timing of it [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3630.24s)]
*  Right [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3638.6s)]

*  Listen you can obviously say that it's [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3788.28s)]
*  Coincidental in some parts, but goddamn and that's just one piece. There's like through the whole movie. There's scenes like that [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=3791.28s)]

*  No, I'd convince people that they can live forever [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4614.72s)]
*  I'd convince people to transplant their soul into a machine where they would be trapped for eternity [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4617.84s)]

*  Actually can be contained [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4822.4400000000005s)]
*  Like what if there's a way to actually put it into something like we think of the soul as being [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4825.280000000001s)]
*  You know like if you believe in it at all you think your soul leaves your body when you die [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4830.64s)]
*  But what if you can suck it out of your body before you die lock it up in a Ken doll [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4836.04s)]
*  I would love for someone to try to suck my soul [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4840.74s)]
*  via the cock [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4843.56s)]

*  What if you just couldn't help it like one of them ladies that has big giant fake butts [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4861.2s)]
*  What if you just kept making more and more duplicate like what if Donald Trump got a hold of the duplicates of your consciousness machine? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4865.84s)]
*  And they said Donald [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4873.72s)]

*  You just keep as much if you have money just keep making duplicates of your consciousness and sending it out there [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4897.36s)]
*  That'd be crazy [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4903.64s)]

*  We're going to what we're going to reach a point like we were talking about like changing your structure like using genetics [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4907.04s)]
*  It's they're gonna do that and they're also gonna merge [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4913.2s)]
*  People gonna merge with machines. It's gonna happen in our life. You think a hundred percent [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4916.68s)]
*  100% they're already working on it [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4923.72s)]
*  They're already work in the first the doorway to it is going to be helping people with neurological conditions injuries spinal cord injury [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4925.88s)]
*  People can't move their bones. They can't move their muscles correctly [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4933.44s)]
*  But does it I I feel like people are just gonna have robots that they work with [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4937.32s)]
*  For a while at least before they merge don't you think I think the real dilemma is going to be what happens first and what? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4943.0s)]
*  has to happen first so if [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4950.5599999999995s)]
*  artificial intelligence can now make its own decisions and if artificial intelligence becomes sentient means it becomes [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4953.68s)]
*  Independent and then decides to make its own decisions and make a better version of itself. It's going to very quickly [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4960.8s)]
*  Reach some godlike level [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4966.599999999999s)]
*  The only way we're gonna survive [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4969.88s)]
*  is if we're merging with it if we're still just fucking talking monkeys and [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=4972.679999999999s)]

*  More than it ever felt like it in 2016 certainly in 2016. It was like a joke to say that he was gonna win [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5174.52s)]

*  They would think you could play a character that said Trump was gonna win, right? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5187.68s)]
*  You don't even know about the regular America. Well, I think he didn't even think he was gonna win [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5191.32s)]
*  Oh, I thought I thought I think he thought he was gonna win you do. Yeah. Oh, I thought he it feel like I felt like he [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5195.76s)]

*  What was it a meet the press? No, they removed nine minutes of him denying the election [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5207.76s)]
*  Of Trump's so he does this interview and the the nine minutes that got removed is all him [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5214.0s)]
*  Talking about the hunter Biden laptop that that was election interference [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5220.6s)]
*  They're doing ballot stuffing the ladies going that's all been disproven [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5225.16s)]
*  That's been disproven by the heads of your intelligence agency that's been disproven by your team [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5228.64s)]
*  You know that that's not true and they're like going back and forth. It's like it's really why let's move on to more productive topics [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5233.8s)]
*  Mr. President, let's move on mr. Pratt and he's like it's real they stuff the ballots. You've seen them stuff it you've seen the photos [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5239.72s)]
*  It's a why it's a wild conversation and they took it off the internet [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5247.12s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5250.84s)]
*  Well, they took it off the show and he's essentially saying like if you went to court he'd have so much evidence [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5251.04s)]
*  So he'd win in court, right? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5256.42s)]
*  But why don't they go to court then this is what I don't understand [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5258.64s)]
*  I don't want to get I'm agnostic about all this stuff [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5261.280000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm until you show me like what kind of evidence is involved in this but isn't it? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5264.12s)]
*  I mean, am I just consuming too much mainstream evidence? I mean a media like I think there is no evidence [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5268.84s)]
*  I think he's completely well [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5274.320000000001s)]
*  What he's saying is that there is evidence and that he needs to provide it in court and what I'm saying is like [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5276.56s)]
*  Why aren't you in court then? Yeah, what because he's lying. Well, I don't know [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5283.4800000000005s)]
*  He's not just sit down. I'm the guy that's gonna sit on evidence [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5287.639999999999s)]
*  That's gonna show that he won that's a big lie and the other things that he said before, you know [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5290.5199999999995s)]
*  They were saying that he was lying about hunter Biden [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5295.719999999999s)]
*  They were saying he was lying about the laptop and then they get the 51 intelligence agencies to back up [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5297.719999999999s)]
*  You know the fact that it was disinformation, but he was right about that though. He was right about the bribes [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5302.759999999999s)]
*  He was right about all that shit. Well, that's the tricky thing about lying so much is of occasionally [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5307.04s)]
*  You're gonna say correct things and people are gonna be like, oh wait. Well, no, you know what it's like [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5311.48s)]
*  It's like you're lying about another lie. Well, you're telling the truth about another liar [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5315.6s)]
*  Like it doesn't mean that you don't lie. Yeah, just because you catch someone lying doesn't mean you don't lie too [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5319.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Donald Trump has certainly said many true things [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5324.72s)]
*  But that's a good point. It's hard to parse parcel parse. What's the word there part in parcel? I think yeah [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5329.0s)]
*  I can't remember but like I for instance, I was lying about the dancing mustache guy [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5334.8s)]
*  See there's this cock it's a stunt double for part of the dance so you can see how giant his quads are right there [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5346.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah the rest of this I'll play it for you though. So you can see so there's her that's her [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5351.0s)]
*  She's very shapely here. It switches to the guy like right now and then he'll do this cool move that maybe she couldn't do [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5355.38s)]
*  You can see he's got tights on [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5361.3s)]
*  This yes, this is the mustache. Oh, he's so jacked. Yeah, that's me right there [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5363.400000000001s)]

*  He's fucking jacked though. Look at her hair and look at his hair like look who they're spinning. He's got fucking short hair [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5396.84s)]
*  They didn't even give him a wig [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5402.7s)]
*  Damn it the mustache thing is bothering me though. I swear there was a must it might be like Shane Gillis mustache [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5406.22s)]

*  Scientific studies that like when you're serving other people that's the key to happiness and there's more and more [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5735.3s)]
*  Podcasts and books and studies about this so hopefully people go boy. I'm really fucking depressed and unhappy [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5740.14s)]

*  You do, but I think it's like the warnings on cigarette boxes [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5750.74s)]
*  Everybody knows they're there and they keep smoking cigarettes [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5754.98s)]
*  Social media is super addictive man, but less people smoke than before that's true [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5758.46s)]
*  So they have worse still a lot of people smoke of course [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5763.339999999999s)]
*  But you might have more people that realize that social media is detrimental to your mental health [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5765.639999999999s)]
*  You know, you probably have more people that would recognize it [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5772.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I think more people do recognize it now than ever before the problem is once you're hooked [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5774.639999999999s)]
*  It's fucking super hard to get off of it. Yeah, it's really hard. I'm bad when I'm by myself when I'm with people [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5779.339999999999s)]
*  Very good about being present, but I spent so much time on the road and when I'm in the hotel [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5784.3s)]
*  I find myself being like I'm gonna watch a movie or read and then I read three paragraphs and I'm like, oh that's a [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5789.02s)]
*  What's up with that guy and I go to Wikipedia and start reading shit. Yeah, the thing to me is [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5794.7s)]
*  You know, I love the fact you can get entertainment on your phone. I love YouTube. I love podcasts [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5800.7s)]
*  I love the fact that you listen to music. I love that. That's it. That's that my favorite part of phone [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5805.74s)]
*  I feel like that's overall net positive [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5810.6s)]
*  You know, I could watch ESPN plus on my phone [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5813.6s)]
*  I watch fights like live streaming with just with 5g just sit if I'm stuck somewhere and like there's a UFC card [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5815.92s)]
*  I just fucking set my phone down right here. Yeah, and I can watch the fights [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5822.6s)]
*  Yeah, I've had to do some boring ass shit that I agreed to do and really part of it. You're just sitting there [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5826.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna set up my phone. All right. I got the fights on now, right? I love that but [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5832.320000000001s)]
*  the social media thing where people are checking their likes and [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5837.740000000001s)]
*  Checking what everybody else is doing and I just think that robs you of time to just interact with people and think [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5841.240000000001s)]
*  And I think we've become super accustomed to that thievery to the point [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5848.8s)]
*  We just sort of accepted it and I've only gone a couple of times without doing it [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5852.96s)]
*  But one time that I did it was in Hawaii broke my phone [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5857.240000000001s)]
*  I dropped it and it just started randomly dialing phone numbers [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5860.780000000001s)]
*  But I'd hold it up and it would just randomly die and I'd press a button [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5863.9800000000005s)]
*  And then we dial somebody else and I press it said end and then dial someone else and you couldn't stop it from doing [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5867.72s)]
*  It I restart he kept doing it. So I had a order of phone from Apple is I was on La Nye [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5873.92s)]
*  It's a small island. Okay, it took like three days to get me a phone [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5878.92s)]
*  But during that three days, I felt so much better [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5882.96s)]
*  I had the same thing happen as the Denver Comedy Works a few years ago the same thing my phone just [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5885.04s)]
*  Crapped out and I had like two days without it and you're like, this is amazing. Yeah [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5889.24s)]
*  I was like a normal person again. Yeah, I was with my family. So I knew where everybody was [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5893.56s)]
*  We were all hanging out together. So it was like normal and I was like, oh my god [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5898.240000000001s)]
*  This is such a better way to interact in life. And then as soon as I got my phone, I went right back to it [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5901.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard not to I was just listening to a thing to some I don't know [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5908.84s)]
*  Psychologist guy or someone was talking about boredom like what you feel when you're bored like we need to feel that and that [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5912.8s)]
*  evolutionarily was like [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5918.160000000001s)]
*  Basically you'd be out hunting and then no animals were coming by and see you felt boredom and that was your brain your body [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5920.2s)]
*  Telling you like hey go do something else productive go get berries or go fucking sleep or whatever [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5927.04s)]
*  Well, we need that to go. Oh, you know what I should do is something else [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5933.5s)]
*  But instead of feeling that we just go straight to the phone [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5937.46s)]
*  It's also one of the ways you come up with your best ideas, right? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5940.24s)]
*  You know when you're just bored and thinking and then you know, you're stuck in a waiting room somewhere with no magazines [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5943.72s)]
*  And then next thing you know, like I used to have some of my best ideas on airplanes [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5949.04s)]
*  Because I would be stuck on the airplane. I couldn't go anywhere [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5953.04s)]
*  Yeah, and back when there was no Wi-Fi and airplanes all I had was a notebook [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5956.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was nice [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5960.68s)]
*  The subway was like that in New York too before when I first moved there you would have a 45 minute ride home [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5961.48s)]
*  Just with your thoughts same thing exactly. Yeah, and we missed that for whatever reason [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5966.84s)]
*  We didn't think that was valuable [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5972.04s)]
*  Because the entertainment that you get off a tick-tock or Twitter or any of that stuff is so much better [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5974.32s)]
*  Well, and now you also have the feeling that I can be productive all the time and in reality [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5979.36s)]
*  In reality, it makes you less productive [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5984.44s)]
*  But you think I can work which is one of the problems they talk about with people working from home [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5986.92s)]
*  Now is there's no more clocking in and clocking out you wake up and you immediately start so you end up working more [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5990.36s)]
*  Maybe or you fuck off a lot, right? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5995.92s)]
*  Jerking off right [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=5999.24s)]
*  But there's there's a lot of [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6003.44s)]
*  Pros and cons to working from home the pros would all apply if you have discipline [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6006.48s)]
*  You know discipline like why do you need to be in an office? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6012.76s)]
*  If you have work that you can get done without other people, but don't we need the dopamine's the eye contact? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6015.12s)]
*  The bumping into people sometimes you do but it depends what you do, right? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6019.96s)]
*  Like if you're an author you want silence, right? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6023.76s)]
*  Right, you don't have to be in a fucking office with a bunch of people if you're an author [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6026.48s)]
*  You want to be able to sit alone and just think sure you'll sit alone and come up with ideas [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6030.0s)]
*  But my father's been working from home. He fucking hates it [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6035.5199999999995s)]
*  He misses being on the train and bumping and he's like an introverted guy, but you know, hi, Sue [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6038.28s)]
*  How do you do or whatever? Right? We need those interactions. I hate to tell you this. I have to piss again piss again [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6042.759999999999s)]
*  I'm so pissing my mouth. I don't care. I took a big IV back today. They're back [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6048.08s)]
*  Hey [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6053.2s)]
*  We're back this is like a dream to me because I piss a lot [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6055.84s)]
*  So every time you have to piss I'm like, this is beautiful [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6059.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, usually I'm pretty good usually I can hang in there for a few hours [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6061.92s)]
*  But it gets it gets hard when I do the IV and also before I did the IV [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6065.2s)]
*  I did the sauna when I go in the sauna [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6069.6s)]
*  I drink a big fucking hydro flask filled with water like a 64 ounce, right? I hit the steam today [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6071.8s)]
*  I'm a big steam room guy. Yeah, like steam. It's not I like both [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6078.360000000001s)]
*  I prefer the sauna because I think it has more benefits because it gets hotter. Oh really the steam like 120 degrees [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6082.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah sauna gets like I do 185. That's is that healthy [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6088.5599999999995s)]
*  It seems to be for me [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6095.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have a problem with it, but I built up to it [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6097.28s)]
*  I do 20 minutes at 185. I used to 25 at 20 seems to sometimes will still do 25 [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6100.08s)]
*  But if especially if I've done the cold first see I find I'm at the gym [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6105.679999999999s)]
*  I don't have a personal sauna. Not yet after this. I feel like you never know but [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6109.88s)]
*  No sarcasm, but I feel like the sauna at the gym is like [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6116.32s)]
*  110 or something like that. Nah [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6121.32s)]
*  It's probably warmer, but I bet they don't jack that sucker up too high [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6123.32s)]
*  They probably won't let it get up to like where I like it [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6127.56s)]
*  Yeah, I love the steam. I love that. Yeah, as soon as you get in there you're fucking drenched and it's also just good to get [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6131.12s)]
*  Your body reacts that and it cools it off and that's what produces these heat shock proteins [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6137.28s)]
*  They're really good for inflammation hot baths are good for it, too [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6142.36s)]
*  There's a lot of different heat exposure is very good for you [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6146.0s)]
*  But the the best at least in terms of like the amount of studies that have been done [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6149.04s)]
*  The best work has been done on the dry sauna [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6153.0s)]
*  Not even an infrared sauna, which also has some benefits [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6155.36s)]
*  But the dry sauna they did this study in Finland that showed over 20 years people that use the sauna four times or more a week [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6158.76s)]
*  Showed a 40% decrease in all cause mortality [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6167.16s)]
*  Wow strokes heart attacks cancer everything and it's this [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6171.16s)]
*  anti-inflammation effect they they believe from the heat shock proteins because your body's just your body deals with that [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6176.8s)]
*  This irritant like this this thing this heat this pressure [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6185.12s)]
*  This this like thing where your body has to react to a very extreme condition, right? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6188.96s)]
*  And in doing so it creates these this anti inflammatory properties to kind of protect itself [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6194.2s)]
*  And then when you get out of there just flushes through your body [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6198.88s)]
*  Maybe I'll start doing more. It's not a laxed. Yeah [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6202.84s)]
*  It's great [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6206.8s)]
*  All right, I'll go sauna, but seems great too. Well, I like it feels good. It's good for your voice and your skin [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6208.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glowing. Yeah, it's weird in there. It's fucking foggy my buddy [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6214.96s)]

*  The low self-esteem room because everyone's in there blowing and fucking each other [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6263.92s)]
*  You're just a guy who goes in there to just get a steam and two guys are sucking each other off [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=6268.72s)]

*  I don't think deer whale's unusual. Yeah. Yeah, both were in Norway. It was reindeer. Does that make a difference? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7009.12s)]
*  Yeah, reindeer is caribou. Okay. Yeah, it's a different animal. It's a different animal [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7016.88s)]
*  It's literally what was on Santa's fucking sled. All right. Well, I had reindeer [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7022.0s)]
*  You know the difference between a reindeer and a caribou is no a reindeer is the fenced in area a caribou is wild [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7026.52s)]
*  Oh, okay. Same animal. I live that this is gonna be like a street shot like a kid's popsicle stick joke [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7033.76s)]
*  When they call it a reindeer, it's when they're captive [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7038.8s)]
*  Because they can domesticate them and they even ride them. That's fun. Yeah [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7042.6s)]
*  This is dude that I had on the podcast who won alone [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7047.4s)]
*  Jordan Jonas really cool guy. You ever see alone? No, but I know but I just heard about it. His episode was amazing [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7050.56s)]
*  He shot a moose with a bow and arrow and then a Wolverine was stealing the moose and he killed the Wolverine with a [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7056.56s)]
*  Hatchet. Holy shit [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7061.96s)]
*  It's a crazy fucking show [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7064.52s)]
*  But he had a massive advantage going into that show because he had spent time living with tribal people in Siberia [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7066.24s)]
*  Wow, like he had spent time with all these folks that they ride around on these caribou or reindeer [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7073.679999999999s)]
*  Right. That's yeah, they domesticate them. That's fucking crazy. Yeah, see if you can find some of those photos [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7080.08s)]
*  Like Santa real-life Santa. They also kill him and eat him, you know, it's kind of it's kind of interesting [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7086.04s)]
*  It's like they have this very strange relationship with them [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7092.12s)]
*  But they they revere them because it's a you know massive part of their survival [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7095.04s)]
*  But they've managed to domesticate a deer species [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7100.0s)]
*  Which I don't think there's other deer species that are domesticated like that's the point where you can ride them [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7102.96s)]
*  This is reindeer are the only deer species to be wildly domesticated. Ah, there you go [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7107.76s)]
*  Are there wild horses still like do you got places this horse is just fucking running around? Yeah. Yeah [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7112.08s)]

*  That's an actual caribou and that's a big one they can fucking you feed them and you can ride them [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7127.24s)]
*  Which is crazy. Where is it? People heard them? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7133.96s)]
*  This was in Siberia where he did it. I don't know where this is right here [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7137.32s)]
*  Click on that's that big picture with the article below it reindeer riders historically [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7142.96s)]
*  semi-nomadic people in several parts of the world of domesticated reindeer, it's [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7148.32s)]

*  So this dude he lived with those folks [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7166.68s)]
*  So like that's a hard scrabble life, you know, so he had a massive advantage being alone and he was good with the bow and arrow [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7170.36s)]
*  So when he killed a moose he had food for like six months [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7176.36s)]
*  That's so that's that's different than this naked and afraid also is that's a similar. Yeah, that shows more exploitative [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7179.400000000001s)]
*  This is people with actual skills and survival and they give them a limited number of tools [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7185.32s)]

*  Civilization or whatever. Yeah, really close and my friend James had an idea that they should we should take people put them where he was [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7235.64s)]
*  And they have to have sex consensual sex with a woman within 72 hours [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7242.92s)]
*  So they have to get out of there [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7248.28s)]
*  But once they're out that's not the whole show then they have to then they have to hook up shower up and hook up with [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7250.2s)]

*  Is it because women are more desirable or is it? [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7283.48s)]
*  Women are more vulnerable because if they fuck they might have to carry that guy's baby around with them [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7286.639999999999s)]

*  Is that what it is? Did they put it on the man? Was it mantle? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7578.96s)]
*  I've never heard anyone call mantle piece. I've never even heard that in my life [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7582.6s)]
*  Well, maybe it's cuz I did construction a lot as a kid, but there's always mantle piece [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7586.42s)]

*  You know [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7596.96s)]
*  Wood burning stove wood burning fireplaces in the house. They're fucking amazing, right? Yeah, my parents have one. It's the worst contributors to pollution [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7598.16s)]
*  one of the worst if you're in a neighborhood and everyone has a [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7607.48s)]
*  Burning fire of wood in their fucking house. Yeah, it's just smoke everywhere. It's like you basically the town has a brush fire [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7612.92s)]
*  But I mean it can't be worse than a 747 flying across the neighbors. Really? Oh, yeah, it's worse [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7622.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah forest fires. You remember those forest fires in Canada remember how bad New York was? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7628.16s)]
*  Yeah, that was that's real bad for you. Sure real bad. That's smoke [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7633.76s)]
*  Right burning wood smoke. The jet is like up in the sky and it's dispersed by winds [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7639.84s)]
*  It's not good, but you're not like getting it in the face, right? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7646.44s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting that smoke in your face man. No, it's going up the fucking flute [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7650.5599999999995s)]
*  And into the sky no, it's going up like this and then it settles down everywhere [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7656.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like a fog in the neighborhood. That's why you smell it everywhere [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7661.92s)]
*  It just depends on how many fireplaces you have how many how close the house are together [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7666.12s)]
*  but I was I never even thought about it until like two years ago I was reading this article about the the amount of [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7670.360000000001s)]
*  Air pollution that comes from wood-burning stoves and I think it was California [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7676.52s)]
*  California that outlawed wood-burning stoves, I don't think you could or wood-burning fireplaces rather [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7681.76s)]
*  I don't think you could build a new house with a wood-burning fireplace anymore in California. Now, what about campfires? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7686.84s)]
*  Those must be horrible to air [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7692.0s)]
*  Terrible terrible, but campfires is like there's one little fire and it's you know, hopefully you're fucking smart [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7694.56s)]
*  You know what you're doing is not too windy [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7701.160000000001s)]
*  You know how to make it in a clearing and all that so you don't light the fucking whole woods on fire, right? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7702.68s)]
*  But yeah, it's not good [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7707.88s)]
*  You know the real bad thing is obviously forest fires forest fires wildfires when those things get going like [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7710.400000000001s)]
*  Entire towns are blanketed with smoke for weeks. Yeah, it was crazy [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7716.96s)]
*  I mean I was in New York earlier this summer or spring [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7720.88s)]
*  I think it was summer and it was fucking wild you couldn't see the buildings [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7723.4800000000005s)]
*  The weird thing was it was like an orange color. Yeah, everybody was speculating. What are they burning? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7726.52s)]
*  That was when the tin foil hatters were talking about like there's a bunch of chemicals that were missing from some train [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7732.16s)]
*  You know, do you know about that story? There's some toxic chemicals that were missing like they're burning the toxic chemicals up and [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7738.48s)]
*  No, I didn't I missed I don't get a lot of things good conspiracy theories. Okay baseball talks in your head [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7744.88s)]

*  Well, cuz the Sun is behind it this Sun and smoke so it makes orange the Sun is orange I've colored [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7763.6s)]
*  Mmm, it's a big I've never seen what's yellow. Whatever. I've never seen forest fire as that orange. The Sun's not yellow. It's chicken [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7771.120000000001s)]

*  Well, whatever that's another conspiracy theory, but the [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7787.200000000001s)]
*  That orange smoke show me some photos of what that looks like the the smoke that was in New York City [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7790.6s)]
*  because it looks crazy orange like like almost like [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7797.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you're you like you're burning Cheetos, but isn't the Sun set is orange [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7800.76s)]
*  So the Sun setting and you got smoke and so it becomes orange II [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7805.32s)]
*  Maybe but I don't think it was during sunset that this was happening [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7809.400000000001s)]
*  So what do you think like people ran down and threw chemicals in the fire? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7813.08s)]
*  No, I think it might be just the whatever the kind of wood that's burning what kind of you know, what's getting burnt [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7816.08s)]

*  I think it's in the billions. I'm gonna say it's like 400 billion trees. I bet it's more than that [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7946.28s)]

*  Well, this is the thing. This is like this is the crazy thing about this whole climate change [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7971.120000000001s)]
*  discussion and one of the things that people conveniently like to [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7975.64s)]
*  Ignore this is the like one of the greenest periods in recorded history [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7978.88s)]
*  When you think like we're cutting down all the trees and there's less trees is less green than ever before right now carbon dioxide [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7985.5599999999995s)]
*  It's food for plants. All right, and there's more plants now [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7992.0s)]
*  Than there there have been in the last like 20 plus years [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7995.719999999999s)]
*  What is the when they say the greening of earth because of climate change Google that like what percentage more? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=7999.0s)]
*  Green is the earth today than [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8006.0s)]
*  50 years ago is that probably cuz I'm there's more rain and shit or what would more carbon dioxide? All right [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8009.04s)]
*  Yeah, literally it's food for them, but there's huge forest fires all these all these places like Greece that they didn't used to be [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8014.32s)]
*  Yeah, but that was man-made. That's this is the other thing. They keep talking about with all this climate change stuff [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8020.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely been forest fires, but a shit ton of them are man-made a shit ton of them are accidents [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8024.639999999999s)]

*  The the Hawaii ones definitely bad maintenance that didn't chop down the dry grass near the power lines [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8036.0s)]
*  They also need to bury power lines. That's fucking stupid [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8041.04s)]
*  Especially places you got high winds bury your fucking power lines [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8044.360000000001s)]
*  You know like look what happened and the United States should take care of that too, by the way, right and then there's also [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8047.4400000000005s)]

*  Controlled burns and all that shit. Yeah, but they have to take it out. They remove it and it's valuable [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8059.4s)]
*  They can do stuff with that wood, right? [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8063.44s)]
*  So they need to log the dead wood out of the forest and they need their decent like [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8065.32s)]
*  They were talking about that during the Trump administration he was blaming some of the fires they were having in California on poor poor [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8071.04s)]
*  Poor management of the forests and and then I was like that sounds like a ridiculous thing and I talked to a guy who was actually [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8079.639999999999s)]
*  Works with wildlife biology. It's like it's it's really critical to do right? Like that's why they do control burns [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8087.84s)]
*  That's why they do get rid of you know [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8094.2s)]
*  Dead wood like if you don't do it and then you have something comes in like at the bark beetle and it kills like a giant [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8096.28s)]

*  moderate resolution imaging [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8133.84s)]

*  I'm always concerned about weather because it's unpredictable right and the thing about climate change [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8178.92s)]
*  Is there's for sure humans are affecting it to deny that seems crazy. We're fucking burning fossil fuels [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8185.160000000001s)]
*  But also it's never been stable like ever in history, right? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8191.72s)]
*  And the history of the earth has always done this crazy shit and there's been massive ice ages where we weren't burning nothing [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8196.12s)]
*  And then there's been like the dinosaur times where it was way fucking hotter [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8202.92s)]
*  And there's been times on earth where there was no ice in the polar caps and there's been times on earth where there's way more [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8207.68s)]
*  And half of North America was covered it over a mile of ice, right? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8213.24s)]
*  So we are right [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8217.92s)]
*  I'm scared of ice ages, dude. No, we'll be fine. Yeah [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8219.52s)]
*  Maybe but that's the thing to be scared of [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8224.08s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah, I feel like I hear a lot more [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8227.48s)]
*  concerned scientists about [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8231.84s)]
*  You know [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8233.72s)]
*  heat [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8235.16s)]
*  Yeah [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8236.16s)]
*  Right because that's the subject du jour. That's the thing you worry about more than terrorism, right? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8237.4s)]
*  But this isn't I'm not talking like NBC. I'm talking like NASA fucking [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8243.119999999999s)]
*  Stephen Hawking I know he's dead but you know, I don't think he was on the climate change thing [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8247.56s)]
*  He was he's paying attention much more to the whole universe [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8252.2s)]
*  I think but he was worried about it. I think I heard him mention it well where or I hear him [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8254.68s)]
*  But you know, I mean I'm ready. Look if the earth gets warmer. It is a concern [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8258.72s)]
*  But if the earth gets cooler that's a concern too, it's just like life on earth is like insanely unpredictable [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8264.24s)]
*  You know and they definitely need to figure out what kind of effect we're having on it [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8271.2s)]
*  But they need to be like completely honest about what they know and what the data shows and what the problem is and how to fix it [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8276.0s)]
*  All right [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8282.44s)]
*  For sure the problem is a pollution problem for sure like the fact that we ignore what we're doing the ocean is crazy [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8283.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I always thought [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8289.88s)]
*  It's like even if you're like not concerned with climate changes like well, aren't you interested in making the air cleaner and the water? [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8291.2s)]
*  I mean shouldn't we be have a cleaner place to live 100% that should be everybody's concerned like to [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8298.6s)]
*  eliminate pollution [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8305.68s)]
*  But yeah, I was my buddy lives in in Seattle and there was at one point [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8307.56s)]

*  I have many huge parks there but there was one park in particular Lincoln Park and they were gonna cut down like 80 trees and [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8312.24s)]
*  All these environmentalist people were going crazy and like stop it and they were chaining themselves and they were like no no, we're [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8319.039999999999s)]
*  We're forest people we need to get rid of these for whatever reason that's beyond me [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8325.6s)]
*  But they were like there's 7,000 trees in this park [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8330.24s)]
*  We're getting rid of 80 because they're whatever problematic. I don't know the science behind it. They're like we're not [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8334.08s)]

*  I really he's the most believable Batman. Yeah, he's just a world-class actor and I liked his fucking Batman voice [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8801.7s)]
*  He's Batman voice, but he's also jacked. He was the first Batman to be jacked [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8807.0s)]

*  Walking Phoenix is the scariest one because that one is the most realistic the most probable [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8838.22s)]
*  Yeah, given that and the weird thing is like when that movie came out [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8843.76s)]
*  It was before society fell apart [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8848.08s)]
*  Right and then that movie showed like this ultimate collapse of society the rebellion of the underclass [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8850.36s)]

*  On the corner of streets and people would be throwing them through windows and the cops would stand by when people are looting things [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8869.72s)]
*  We'd never seen in our life. It was very joker esque and that dude was an amazing joker. He looked fucking [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlP2msooaK0&t=8875.12s)]
