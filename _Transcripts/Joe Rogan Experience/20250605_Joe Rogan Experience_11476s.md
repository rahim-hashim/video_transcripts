# Joe Rogan Experience #2333 - Protect Our Parks 15
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6.0s)]
*  Alright, we're rolling. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=10.0s)]
*  Don't do anything illegal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=14.0s)]
*  Come on, everybody's on the Zim. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=16.0s)]
*  I think it's probably bad for you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=19.0s)]
*  It might, 100% might, in the end be bad for you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=21.0s)]
*  There's also that part of me I can't bring myself to actually not work out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=24.0s)]
*  You look ripped. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=28.0s)]
*  You're allowed to work out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=30.0s)]
*  You don't want to talk about it, but look at those shoulders. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=32.0s)]
*  Look at those shoulders, dog. Those shoulders are coming in strong. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=37.0s)]
*  You look noticeably thicker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=39.0s)]
*  Like, noticeably thicker. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=41.0s)]
*  That's what I said to my trainer. He's like, you want to lose weight? I said, no. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=43.0s)]
*  Bigger. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=46.0s)]
*  You want to get chapped. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=48.0s)]
*  Dude, you've been in this gym like super fucking consistent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=50.0s)]
*  If I'm in Austin, I come here every day. It's very nice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=52.0s)]
*  Every time you open that door and I see you pop out, I'm like, fuck yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=55.0s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=58.0s)]
*  Get after it. Get after it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=60.0s)]
*  Do you worry about the buff comedy though? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=62.0s)]
*  I will never actually get in shape. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=64.0s)]
*  Well, I very rarely wear a t-shirt on stage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=67.0s)]
*  Or anything tight. Shirtless is my move. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=70.0s)]
*  I just want to look like a fucking champ. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=73.0s)]
*  Shut off the Hulk Hogan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, Grisha, when he started losing weight and he was getting jacked, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm like, you're taking away from your act there, fella. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=82.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=84.0s)]
*  You look like a football player now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=85.0s)]
*  Bert was getting some big thick ass shoulders. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=87.0s)]
*  I don't do a lot of fat jokes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=89.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=91.0s)]
*  If any. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=92.0s)]
*  No, you don't really. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=93.0s)]
*  You might make fun of yourself if it helps something. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=96.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=97.0s)]
*  You're not fat enough. You're more like squishy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, just a fat guy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=100.0s)]
*  You're not like a fat guy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=102.0s)]
*  So absurdly fat that we have to talk about it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=103.0s)]
*  Bert doesn't really do fat jokes either. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=105.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=107.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=108.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=109.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=110.0s)]
*  Sometimes you just got to attack the elephant in the room just to get it out of the way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=111.0s)]
*  But then after that, fuck it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=115.0s)]
*  But if you're really good, you don't even need it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=117.0s)]
*  But if you have a joke that's funny, that's fat, like who fucking cares? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=119.0s)]
*  That's the weirdest thing is comics like policing what should be talked about. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=123.0s)]
*  If someone comes up with the most amazing fart joke of all time, I'm going to die laughing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=127.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=132.0s)]
*  It's like I don't do any. I don't have any. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=133.0s)]
*  But it's like on anything and everything. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=135.0s)]
*  There's a take on anything and everything that's like, ah! [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=141.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=142.0s)]
*  It's just you got to find where it is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=143.0s)]
*  It's kind of my goal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=145.0s)]
*  Just come up with the best fart joke of all time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=146.0s)]
*  No, not yet. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=148.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=149.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=150.0s)]
*  You're bad at boos today, dude. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=151.0s)]
*  What's up with you? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=153.0s)]
*  He's fired up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=154.0s)]
*  He's gamed it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=155.0s)]
*  You've pulled out three drugs. I've been here eight minutes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=156.0s)]
*  Shh. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=158.0s)]
*  They're all legal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=159.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=160.0s)]
*  No drugs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=161.0s)]
*  Just nicotine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=162.0s)]
*  Just ozempic. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=163.0s)]
*  Don't get the feds on us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=164.0s)]
*  Lucy breakers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=165.0s)]
*  What's the name of the fish? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=166.0s)]
*  Oh, that's from, you ever see that YouTube show, The Y-Files? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=167.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=170.0s)]
*  It's a great fucking show. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=171.0s)]
*  It's all about like fucking aliens and why you can't go into the Grand Canyon [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=173.0s)]
*  and you know secret fucking temples and stuff like that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=176.0s)]
*  And AJ Gentile is the host and then this is a fish that sits in the fish tank next to him and talks shit to him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=179.0s)]
*  I will be a strict but fair lord of these lands and my fists will come to finalize. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=187.0s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=193.0s)]
*  That's happened to them right away. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=194.0s)]
*  I can't say there's no drugs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=196.0s)]
*  They hold up a block and stuff the animal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=197.0s)]
*  Full face. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=199.0s)]

*  He's gonna bite me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=203.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is like now everybody comes and they give me something for the table. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=204.0s)]
*  That's like part of the fun. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=207.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=208.0s)]
*  I got this little Olmec head. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=209.0s)]
*  That's sick. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=210.0s)]
*  From Luke Caverns. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=211.0s)]
*  Pretty dope. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=212.0s)]
*  Cute. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=213.0s)]
*  I also got an Aztec death whistle. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=214.0s)]
*  Do not blow it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=215.0s)]
*  I blew it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=216.0s)]
*  I blew it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=217.0s)]
*  The last time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=218.0s)]
*  Theos. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=219.0s)]
*  The last time we had one of these and we blew it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=220.0s)]
*  You blew a death whistle at a party? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=222.0s)]
*  Dylan blew it on the podcast and the pandemic started a month later. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=223.0s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=225.0s)]
*  Fucking LA was locked down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=226.0s)]
*  People were connecting it to the death whistle. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=229.0s)]
*  It killed Bob Saget. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=231.0s)]
*  It was a conspiracy theory. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=232.0s)]
*  Oh, poor Bob. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=233.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=234.0s)]
*  You got me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=235.0s)]
*  Ah, the death rattle. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=236.0s)]
*  Because I think that one drives me nuts. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=237.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=240.0s)]
*  Bob Saget does? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it's the same thing that happened to Heather McDonald. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=242.0s)]
*  Blacked out, fell, smashed her head, died. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=245.0s)]
*  She lived because she was on stage and luckily they got her medical help. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=248.0s)]
*  Rug, rug on the stage also. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=251.0s)]
*  It was fake? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=252.0s)]
*  No, rug. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=253.0s)]
*  Oh, no, it was hardwood. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=254.0s)]
*  I don't think there was a rug. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=255.0s)]
*  What stage was it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=256.0s)]
*  I've seen that video 30 times. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=258.0s)]
*  It's hardwood. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=260.0s)]
*  Her head bounces. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=261.0s)]
*  It's very terrifying. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=262.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=263.0s)]
*  That's how people die in street fights. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=264.0s)]
*  That's the big reason why people die in street fights. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=265.0s)]
*  They get knocked down and they hit their head. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=266.0s)]
*  It's not from getting punched to death most of the time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=267.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=268.0s)]
*  Most of the time it's from falling and hitting your head. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=269.0s)]
*  Remember the knockout game? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=270.0s)]
*  Knockout game. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=271.0s)]
*  That was big. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=272.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=304.0s)]
*  You can't be the same again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=305.0s)]
*  Question is, did it kill? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=306.0s)]
*  Did it get a laugh? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=307.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=308.0s)]
*  It was the biggest laugh of the reset. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=309.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=310.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=311.0s)]
*  Well, might have been worth it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=312.0s)]
*  Till people found out it was real. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=313.0s)]
*  Yeah, they thought it was just being hilarious. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=314.0s)]
*  They thought it was a funny joke. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=315.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=316.0s)]
*  Which is the way you would do it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=317.0s)]
*  You ever get an accidental joke where you say something and everyone laughs, you're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=318.0s)]
*  like, oh, I can see the double meaning on that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=320.32s)]
*  Oh, it's Alpertron. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=322.12s)]
*  I meant that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=323.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=324.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=325.12s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=326.12s)]
*  Well, that's the difference between writing it and saying it, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=327.12s)]
*  You write it and you're like, I think I know how to go with this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=328.12s)]
*  And then you get on stage and say it and you're like, oh that's the funny part. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=330.68s)]
*  This is fucking ridiculous. The fact that this exists is ridiculous. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=333.68s)]
*  I'm always embarrassed if I wrote something and then say it and it's not even close. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=337.68s)]
*  What the fuck was I thinking? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=340.68s)]
*  At this point, I always think of it as like a scaffolding. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=343.68s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know what's good until I get up there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=346.68s)]
*  Yeah, well it's funny how when you're in your apartment you're killing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=349.68s)]
*  You're like, man this is good stuff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=351.68s)]
*  And then when you get up there you can like feel, this won't work. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=353.68s)]
*  Right when you're on stage. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=356.68s)]
*  I don't know why I'm saying this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=358.68s)]
*  But when you have people in front of you, you're like, oh this is not going to hit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=360.68s)]
*  Oh my god, it's the best. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=362.68s)]
*  And then you went into it with so prepared and then they're just looking at you like, I don't get it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=364.68s)]
*  You go into it like, I wrote a new bit today, this thing's going to fucking kill. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=368.68s)]
*  In your notebook. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=372.68s)]
*  That's why comedy is great because you can never really crack it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=374.68s)]
*  You can get better at it but you can never really go, this is going to work. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=377.68s)]
*  It's also like a truly collaborative thing. You have to have an audience. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=381.68s)]
*  It's like, Gary Clark Jr. could write a fucking amazing album by himself in his private music studio. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=384.68s)]
*  And nobody has to hear it until you listen to it the first time. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=391.68s)]
*  You're like, god damn. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=394.68s)]

*  Okay. I'll tell you guys, cut all this out. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=411.68s)]
*  I'll tell you guys what happened. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=415.68s)]

*  He freaks out. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=426.68s)]
*  He asked me for advice. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=427.68s)]

*  Where I go, don't sign anything with anybody. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=431.68s)]
*  And he's like, they're telling me I have to strike one of the irons high. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=433.68s)]

*  You already made it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=439.68s)]
*  I know if you wrote that song, you could write a dozen of those fucking songs. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=440.68s)]
*  You don't need anybody. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=445.68s)]

*  So cut to, he starts making millions of dollars, doing arenas. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=454.68s)]
*  The wife divorces him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=459.68s)]
*  She wants everything. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=460.68s)]

*  Right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=746.68s)]

*  The day's over. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=760.68s)]

*  That was the good thing about COVID, right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=779.68s)]
*  The people who are risk takers, you get together with them. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=780.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=782.68s)]
*  You'd go outside, too, and just drink out there. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=783.68s)]
*  How long did you guys go without being around anybody, though? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=784.68s)]

*  I was like, hey, too close, too close. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=816.68s)]
*  Louis, immediately, I'm like, hey, I'm still trying to, and he just licks your face. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=818.68s)]

*  Really? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=851.68s)]
*  You had time to think, time to hang out with your friends. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=852.68s)]
*  Also, I had just gotten canceled. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=853.68s)]

*  That's true. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=861.68s)]
*  Because nobody was traveling. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=862.68s)]
*  You went to North Carolina, right? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=863.68s)]

*  Don't say gook. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=870.68s)]
*  Make a fire on the beach. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=871.68s)]

*  and was trying to get a sacred item from them [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1723.46s)]

*  And they didn't wanna give it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1727.78s)]
*  And he was very insistent [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1728.62s)]
*  and he apparently offended them deeply. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1729.58s)]
*  And then when he returned, they're like, oh, he's back. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1733.1s)]
*  And they stabbed him when he was in the boat. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1735.54s)]
*  They were taking him in the boat over there [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1737.02s)]

*  I think it was the offense [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1757.78s)]
*  because they would have killed him the first time. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1758.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe they would have killed him and not eaten him. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=1760.3s)]

*  I was playing a board game with my family [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3018.14s)]
*  in the living room, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3019.22s)]
*  and one of my kids yelled out, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3020.3399999999997s)]
*  one of my kids yelled out, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3022.8199999999997s)]
*  it's a coyote. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3024.3399999999997s)]
*  And then you see this fucking coyote [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3026.1s)]
*  run across the backyard with a chicken in his mouth. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3028.62s)]
*  Just get to that fucking fence and leap. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3031.3799999999997s)]
*  It like flew. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3034.58s)]
*  Like gravity wasn't real. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3035.66s)]
*  Were you like impressed or were you mad? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3037.62s)]
*  Super impressed. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3038.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3039.66s)]
*  So it was like, well, it's like that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3040.5s)]
*  You can't be mad. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3041.3399999999997s)]
*  I was mad. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3042.2599999999998s)]
*  I wanted to kill it, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3043.1s)]
*  but it's like that's what they do, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3043.94s)]
*  and that was impressive. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3045.58s)]
*  That chicken's cost is worth you saying that. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3047.82s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3050.02s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3050.86s)]
*  But then Johnny realized that there's this whole... [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3051.98s)]
*  That was like one chicken was brooding, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3056.02s)]
*  and when a chicken's brooding, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3058.26s)]
*  you have to separate them from the other chickens [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3059.34s)]
*  because they won't lay eggs [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3060.9s)]
*  and they pick all their feathers out. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  They think they're gonna make a baby [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3062.86s)]
*  with this unfertilized egg, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3064.1800000000003s)]
*  so they would just wanna sit on top of the egg. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3065.82s)]
*  They don't wanna go around. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3067.7000000000003s)]
*  It's a weird psychological thing. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3068.6200000000003s)]
*  The way to break them of it, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3070.42s)]
*  you take them and you put them in a little tiny pen [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3071.34s)]
*  by themselves where they have to stand on a post. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3073.98s)]
*  They can't nest, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3076.82s)]
*  And then they do it for a few days, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3078.1800000000003s)]
*  and they're like, I'm over it. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3079.34s)]
*  And then they go back to being a regular chicken. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3080.58s)]
*  They're not the smartest things in the world. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3082.1400000000003s)]
*  So this one was in this little tiny one, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3084.1400000000003s)]
*  but then Johnny Cash realized, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3086.5s)]
*  I could just go through this wall [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3088.78s)]
*  because he was a 140 pound mastiff. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3090.5s)]
*  He was huge, so he just tore the chicken wire open himself [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3093.7000000000003s)]
*  and killed nine chickens before I got to him. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3098.6200000000003s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3100.9s)]
*  Yeah, that was a couple days later. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3102.42s)]
*  But the coyotes had talked to him [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3103.86s)]
*  and convinced him, chicken eating is fun. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3106.6600000000003s)]
*  You're not eating these chickens. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3109.1000000000004s)]
*  Look how big you are. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3110.9s)]
*  You can eat the chickens. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3111.7400000000002s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3112.5800000000004s)]
*  It tricked him into doing it, man. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3113.5800000000004s)]
*  He had never done that before. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3115.5800000000004s)]
*  And then he's hanging out with this coyote, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3117.3s)]
*  and the coyote is like his homie. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3119.1400000000003s)]
*  Damn. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3121.98s)]
*  Honey dictum? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3122.82s)]
*  Honey dictum. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3123.6600000000003s)]
*  What's that term? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3124.5s)]
*  They probably sent a female coyote, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3125.34s)]
*  and just like, ooh. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3127.6200000000003s)]
*  It's what the Mormons do. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3129.46s)]
*  Smells like pussy, doesn't it? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3130.54s)]
*  The Mormons are on Salt Lake. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3132.1000000000004s)]
*  They send other cute ones to try to convert you, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3133.14s)]
*  try to get you in. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3134.7799999999997s)]
*  I heard it works. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3135.62s)]
*  That would work on me in a second. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3136.54s)]
*  That would work. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3137.74s)]
*  It's a hot water alone? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3138.58s)]
*  If you're 21. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3139.42s)]
*  No, but the problem is it's a Utah hot, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3140.2599999999998s)]
*  so it's like a five. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3142.42s)]
*  I disagree, Utah is hot ladies out in Salt Lake. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3143.2599999999998s)]
*  Utah is pretty hot. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3146.2599999999998s)]
*  The ones out, the ones still in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3147.1s)]
*  are chubby and fucking not tattooed. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3148.38s)]
*  You see Japan. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3150.54s)]
*  Good. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3151.58s)]
*  Why is it they have to be tattooed for? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3152.42s)]
*  I like them. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3154.66s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3155.5s)]
*  Anyone in Utah that's out of the Mormons [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3156.58s)]
*  that are just like fuck sleeves. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3158.14s)]
*  Always. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3159.46s)]
*  Once they get out, they go hard. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3160.2999999999997s)]
*  They go hard. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3163.14s)]
*  Fake tits, they go in. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3163.98s)]
*  Well seeing as they feel like they have to make up [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3165.2999999999997s)]
*  for lost time. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3166.8199999999997s)]
*  They wear magic underwear since you're 24. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3167.66s)]
*  They can't even drink coffee. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3170.8199999999997s)]
*  That's so crazy, but you can drink energy drinks. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3172.34s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3174.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3174.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3175.8199999999997s)]
*  My friend was a Mormon, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3176.64s)]
*  he was down in these fucking giant monsters. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3177.48s)]
*  I was like, bro, that is way more caffeine [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3178.9s)]
*  than a cup of coffee. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3180.7799999999997s)]
*  He's like, yeah, but it says coffee. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3183.02s)]
*  It doesn't say energy drinks. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3184.54s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but a guy wrote it. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3185.7s)]
*  We know the guy. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3186.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3187.7799999999997s)]
*  It's tough telling a Mormon, they believe a guy wrote it. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3188.62s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3191.7400000000002s)]
*  A 14 year old wrote that down. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3193.5800000000004s)]
*  Just some dude. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3194.9s)]
*  He had gold tablet and he was the only one that could read it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3195.7400000000002s)]
*  He would deprive energy drinks of you too. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3197.78s)]
*  That's true. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3200.0600000000004s)]
*  He would now. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3200.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3201.7200000000003s)]
*  He just didn't know about it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3202.5600000000004s)]
*  No loopholes. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3203.4s)]
*  No porn, no caffeine, no booze. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3204.2200000000003s)]
*  Magic underwear. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3205.86s)]
*  And they gotta soak. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3206.78s)]
*  They can't thrust. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3207.82s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3208.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't mind a little soaking. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3209.5s)]
*  I love the idea of soaking. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3210.34s)]
*  Soaking is actually extremely good. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3211.38s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3212.5800000000004s)]
*  It's even if a girl gets off on a soak, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3213.42s)]
*  just leave it in, no movement. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3215.54s)]
*  She's like, that's what I like. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3216.6600000000003s)]

*  Wanna see pictures? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3229.54s)]

*  It was pro-women. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3461.46s)]
*  It's pro-women and then there's trans women [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3462.5s)]
*  who think they're women and they wanna compete with women [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3464.9s)]

*  If you just were allowed to beat up women, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3479.78s)]
*  if you made a league where men are allowed to fight women, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3482.06s)]
*  how fucking scary. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3484.66s)]

*  He's like, I'm gonna take my babe on a nice vacation. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3509.06s)]
*  Some guy in the neighborhood might smack her [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3511.22s)]
*  in the head for you. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3512.9s)]

*  one of the places that has the most [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3519.9s)]
*  gender transition surgeries? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3522.5s)]
*  No way. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3524.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know why? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3525.3s)]
*  Because you can't be gay. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3526.26s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3527.98s)]
*  So they just become trans. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3529.26s)]
*  A lot of religious loopholes. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3531.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3533.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3533.9s)]

*  I mean, he says that's true. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3535.9s)]
*  I love that moment, you say something out loud, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3536.82s)]
*  you're like, actually that might not be. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3538.26s)]
*  I'm pretty sure we've actually looked it up before. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3539.98s)]
*  And so you're not gay, you're trans, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3541.7s)]
*  so it's so interesting. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3543.06s)]
*  But they don't allow trans. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3544.46s)]
*  They do. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3546.06s)]

*  Ah, you gotta be convincing. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3548.42s)]
*  Wrap it up, cover the head, cover the face. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3549.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's so easy to be trans there. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3552.06s)]
*  You could be a furry, that's what furries are all about. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3554.14s)]
*  You get a hatch, you're just a hatch. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3556.78s)]
*  You pop the hatch, you're fucking a squirrel. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3559.06s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3560.9s)]
*  Don't get me started. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3562.1s)]
*  You're just a happy chipmunk, banging a squirrel. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3562.94s)]
*  Don't get me started on these good ideas. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3565.26s)]
*  Great ideas. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3567.14s)]
*  Everybody just looks like a cute cartoon character. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3568.42s)]
*  Never go eye to eye with anybody, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3570.78s)]
*  cause they're soulless, there's no eye there. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3572.34s)]
*  There is a sex reassignment surgery, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3575.5s)]
*  is not only legal in Iran, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3577.86s)]
*  but to Iran it's considered to be an international hub [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3579.94s)]
*  for obtaining it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3582.02s)]
*  Guys, let's go. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3582.86s)]
*  The procedure's been allowed since Ayatollah, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3583.7000000000003s)]
*  boy, say his name. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3585.66s)]
*  Ayatollah Khomeini. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3586.5s)]
*  Khomeini, but the first, the middle part was Ruhollah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3587.34s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3590.62s)]
*  Khomeini learned of the hardships of trans women [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3591.94s)]
*  and issued a religious decree to legalize it [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3594.7000000000003s)]
*  in the mid 1980s. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3597.38s)]
*  What? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3598.38s)]
*  During the Ayatollah Khomeini's rule? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3599.2200000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3601.06s)]
*  Yeah, so it's illegal to be gay. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3601.9s)]
*  But you can switch genders, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3604.26s)]
*  cause that's what's really going on. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3606.1800000000003s)]
*  You're not really a gay man, that's impossible. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3607.38s)]

*  Okay, are you sure? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3623.1400000000003s)]
*  All right, let's go, surgery. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=3624.42s)]

*  I said get me a beer. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5259.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like we founded Twitter together. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5260.900000000001s)]
*  Relax. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5262.82s)]
*  Relax. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5264.74s)]
*  We did the Boston Comedy Fest and we were all in the finals [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5265.58s)]
*  and we were like, all right, whoever wins, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5268.78s)]
*  cause the pot was 10 grand, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5270.66s)]
*  which was enormous at that level. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5272.54s)]
*  And we were like, whoever wins, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5275.42s)]
*  we'll split it up this way, that way. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5276.7s)]
*  You can do it for a second. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5278.34s)]
*  One guy was off in the shadows, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5280.02s)]
*  and we're like, he's not gonna make it. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5282.74s)]
*  This guy sucks, he's no good. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5283.7s)]
*  That guy's definitely gonna win. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5285.139999999999s)]
*  He won. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5286.099999999999s)]
*  The whole thing to Boston Strong, we all hated him. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5287.58s)]
*  What's Boston Strong? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5289.9s)]
*  Oh, the marathon. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5290.9s)]
*  It was that year. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5292.54s)]
*  What a fucking great job. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5293.38s)]
*  What a piece of shit. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5294.7s)]
*  Did he ever make it as a comic? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5297.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's hilarious. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5299.139999999999s)]
*  He's a really funny guy, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5300.139999999999s)]
*  but at the time we're like, this guy's going nowhere, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5301.139999999999s)]
*  and then he won. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5303.34s)]
*  Yeah, anytime I've done a comedy competition, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5304.179999999999s)]
*  the guy who's sitting by himself and quiet, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5306.099999999999s)]
*  you go, fuck. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5308.34s)]
*  He's doing the math over here. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5309.42s)]
*  He's down here having fun. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5311.3s)]
*  We're all hungover and drinking. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5313.42s)]
*  This little Indian kid. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5315.74s)]
*  They used to have this thing called [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5317.26s)]
*  the Boston Comedy Riot. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5318.22s)]
*  It was like the biggest comedy competition. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5319.46s)]
*  The WBCN radio would host it. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5321.9s)]
*  It was the Boston Comedy Riot. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5324.38s)]
*  It was like in the 1980s. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5325.74s)]
*  WBCN. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5327.22s)]
*  The Boston and the Seattle competitions [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5328.46s)]
*  were the big ones. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5330.5s)]
*  They never did either one of them, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5331.34s)]
*  but it was like weeks long, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5332.18s)]
*  so you had to either keep going up there or be there. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5333.7s)]
*  Yeah, that Seattle was like, that was hell. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5336.34s)]
*  You're poor. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5338.54s)]
*  You have to be a guy with no life. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5339.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5340.74s)]
*  Poor Seattle resident. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5341.58s)]
*  Willing to hang in there for the long haul [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5343.26s)]
*  for the golden prize of being the winner [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5345.5s)]
*  of the Seattle competition. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5348.18s)]
*  Did we do any competitions? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5349.02s)]
*  I think I lost one to Sam. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5349.86s)]
*  Yeah, I did a bunch at the beginning. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5351.34s)]
*  Which Sam? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5353.86s)]
*  Atlanta, Murill. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5354.7s)]
*  I think he ended up winning. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5356.14s)]
*  I think we were both in the final. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5357.42s)]
*  Oh, the laughing skull. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5358.9400000000005s)]
*  He did win that. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5360.38s)]
*  Did they just kick them out? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5361.46s)]
*  Huh? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5363.1s)]
*  Did the vortex just kick out the laughing skull? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5363.9400000000005s)]
*  What happened? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5366.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5367.22s)]
*  I think the vortex said, you guys gotta go, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5368.06s)]
*  the owners gotta go. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5369.74s)]
*  Pull it up. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5370.7s)]
*  What happened? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5371.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5372.38s)]
*  You gotta pee? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5373.22s)]
*  What is that about? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5374.06s)]
*  You know why? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5374.9s)]
*  That was a great little room. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5375.74s)]
*  It was. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5376.58s)]
*  It was just a headline. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5377.42s)]
*  85 seats. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5378.26s)]
*  Great little room. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5379.1s)]
*  Fun room. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5380.22s)]
*  Someone's gotta film the special. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5381.26s)]
*  There's no space for cameras, but someone still had to. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5382.54s)]
*  I think someone filmed something there. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5384.78s)]
*  I think I've seen stuff from there. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5386.38s)]
*  Yeah, Atlanta's a great comedy town. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5388.18s)]
*  What happened? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5389.74s)]
*  There was this headline I kind of passed by for a second. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5390.9s)]
*  You ever do those and then go, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5394.0199999999995s)]
*  and you're like, I actually read that one. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5395.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the headlines. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5397.46s)]
*  You get the yons. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5398.98s)]
*  You think, you're just getting overwhelmed by headlines. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5400.219999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5402.46s)]
*  That's true. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5403.299999999999s)]
*  There's so much, that's important, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5404.139999999999s)]
*  but maybe not as important as the next one. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5405.9s)]
*  I may scroll down a little. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5407.54s)]
*  But it all goes into your brain. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5408.66s)]
*  And you know the headlines are all lies. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5410.66s)]
*  They're all lies. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5412.42s)]
*  Made by some other, not the writer. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5413.259999999999s)]
*  So you're like, oh, okay, I guess it's that. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5414.58s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5416.66s)]
*  If you write a really good article, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5418.0199999999995s)]
*  someone could fuck it up with some misleading shit [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5419.42s)]
*  in the headline. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5422.099999999999s)]
*  Laughing Skull Lounge founder will leave the vortex [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5422.94s)]
*  after 16 years. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5425.42s)]
*  Sad. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5426.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5427.42s)]
*  That was a great room. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5428.259999999999s)]
*  After two decades, they're splitting up. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5429.22s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5431.14s)]
*  There'll be no Laughing Skull or just the guys out? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5431.9800000000005s)]
*  I think, I don't know. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5435.02s)]
*  Laughing Skull Lounge will still be open in the vortex, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5436.860000000001s)]
*  but not as we know it today. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5438.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh oh. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5441.06s)]
*  The founder and team will be exploring [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5441.900000000001s)]
*  other comedy avenues in the city. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5443.46s)]
*  So they'll do another Laughing Skull somewhere else. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5445.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5448.900000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5449.740000000001s)]
*  Nobody cares about the name. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5450.58s)]
*  Wow, that room. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5451.700000000001s)]
*  It's the venue. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5452.54s)]
*  Well, they know how to do it though. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5453.38s)]
*  They'll probably find one that's like it. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5455.06s)]
*  Nah, the rooms are important. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5456.820000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5458.46s)]
*  It's not a chipotle. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5459.22s)]
*  You can't just reproduce it somewhere. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5460.06s)]
*  But you might be able to find a similar size room. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5461.42s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5464.34s)]
*  Good luck starting a new room. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5465.46s)]
*  Atlanta's got a lot of, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5466.3s)]
*  but it's not starting a new room. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5467.38s)]
*  They have a giant email list. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5468.82s)]
*  Why are you so pessimistic? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5470.06s)]
*  No, because the actual room, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5471.26s)]
*  the old stand versus the new stand, they're different. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5474.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5475.78s)]
*  The La Jolla Comedy Store versus the regular Comedy Store, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5476.62s)]
*  the Comedy Store versus the main room. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5478.26s)]
*  Those are different rooms. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5479.42s)]
*  Elliot Page. Absolutely. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5480.78s)]
*  You know, Elliot versus Elliot. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5481.74s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like you can't reproduce that. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5483.38s)]

*  but there's something about Diaz [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5535.9s)]
*  when he would go on stage in the fucking O.R. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5537.22s)]
*  like late at night when no one cared. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5539.58s)]
*  Just doesn't matter. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5541.54s)]

*  Yes. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5800.58s)]
*  Like a sitcom. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5801.42s)]
*  Because he was a lawyer, so he could get this off your life. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5802.26s)]
*  That's what they always do. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=5803.9800000000005s)]

*  Oh, he was so hot when he was young. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6821.76s)]
*  He was like the first black, white guy. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6824.0s)]
*  Is that the General? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6827.96s)]
*  You know, he was like the first wigger. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6828.8s)]
*  Is that the General right there? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6829.8s)]
*  Show him the right keys. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6831.04s)]
*  No. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6832.32s)]
*  That's a different guy, different handling? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6833.16s)]
*  No, I think that's one of his musicians. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6834.04s)]
*  So I heard Dolly talking about him. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6836.44s)]
*  Oh, he's cranked out of his fucking mind, Dolly. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6838.24s)]
*  Dolly Llama? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6840.8s)]
*  Oh, this is nice. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6841.64s)]
*  I just recorded it, I don't know. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6843.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6845.24s)]
*  Is it out? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6848.08s)]
*  About two weeks. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6850.08s)]
*  Two weeks to be out. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6850.92s)]
*  He's not being no different than Winehouse Late. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6852.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6854.08s)]
*  You're thinking, how's this guy gonna do this? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6855.36s)]
*  You're thinking he's out of his mind. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6857.84s)]
*  He's in another dimension right now. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6860.64s)]
*  He's on uppers or downers? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6861.92s)]
*  You can hear how quiet the room is. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6862.76s)]
*  They're going, god damn. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6864.32s)]
*  This is like O'Connor before he goes on drunk. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6865.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6867.84s)]
*  He's like, he'll be fine. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6868.68s)]
*  He'll figure it out. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6870.04s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6870.88s)]
*  I'll tell you in a second. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6871.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was nervous about it. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6872.56s)]
*  No. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6875.56s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6876.4s)]
*  Cranked out of his mind. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6877.24s)]
*  Listen how good this is. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6878.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6879.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6880.48s)]
*  I can't get a mic stand. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6882.84s)]
*  Good point. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6886.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6888.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6912.0s)]
*  God damn. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6917.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6918.48s)]
*  So good. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6919.6s)]
*  It was. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6923.48s)]
*  Man, you must have been shitting. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6924.32s)]
*  McKeever before my special. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6927.04s)]
*  God damn, that's good. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6928.68s)]
*  Made that exact joke about O'Connor. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6929.64s)]
*  He was like, the only way you can fuck this special up [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6931.6s)]
*  is if you black out before the show. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6934.04s)]
*  And then even then it'd be like Fat Elvis on Jane Mountain. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6936.8s)]
*  It would just crush it. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6939.44s)]
*  Crush it, go in the green room. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6940.32s)]
*  I'm like. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6941.599999999999s)]
*  Get on stage, just crush it. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6942.44s)]
*  Do it. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6944.2s)]
*  Oh, my love. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6945.04s)]
*  God damn, that was good. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6947.92s)]
*  I mean, if you heard that guy talking before the, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6948.96s)]
*  if you were in the audience, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6952.0s)]
*  we're like, oh no, we came to the wrong night. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6952.88s)]
*  You sit there going, is this song out yet? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6954.4s)]
*  They go, two weeks, kids. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6956.12s)]
*  It's just pure talent that'll overcome the obstacles. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6957.04s)]
*  Look how sweaty he is. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6960.08s)]
*  Oh, chubby. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6961.36s)]
*  Give me some more of this, Jamie. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6962.2s)]
*  He's launching this song right now? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6968.599999999999s)]
*  He's like, I know you're about to hear it all the time. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6970.92s)]
*  They haven't even heard it yet. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6973.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6974.4s)]
*  God damn. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=6985.24s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7001.08s)]
*  Great bloated thrust. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7009.24s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7023.16s)]
*  That still hits. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7024.8s)]
*  God damn! [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7030.08s)]
*  You guys are allegedly on mushrooms that must have been fucking nice. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7032.08s)]
*  Oh my god, it's so good. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7036.08s)]
*  That is one fat talent. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7039.08s)]
*  That's what we live for. We live for those, like if you could belt out one of them moments in your life, you did it. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7041.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7046.08s)]
*  One of those moments, I mean this guy had a ton of them. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7047.08s)]
*  But one of those moments, and nobody had ever gotten that famous before. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7050.08s)]
*  Nobody had ever, like nobody gets that famous ever and doesn't go crazy. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7053.08s)]
*  But nobody had ever gotten that famous before Elvis. He was the first. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7058.08s)]
*  It's also, you go to his house, it's not that big. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7063.08s)]
*  Like your house is probably the same size as Elvis'. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7066.08s)]
*  No, it's pretty nice. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7068.08s)]
*  His house is bigger. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7069.08s)]
*  Come on man. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7070.08s)]
*  Who? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7071.08s)]
*  Come on. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7072.08s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7073.08s)]
*  I live in a big ass house man. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7074.08s)]
*  Come on man. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7075.08s)]
*  First of all, which house? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7076.08s)]
*  I was just saying you see like little bow wow on the fridge. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7078.08s)]
*  He's got a suburban house. It's just like house in the burbs. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7082.08s)]
*  That's all I always say. You don't need a big house. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7085.08s)]
*  If I was by myself I'd have a regular house. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7088.08s)]
*  Yeah you would. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7090.08s)]
*  You don't need, it's all nonsense. It's just where you live. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7091.08s)]
*  That's the first thing I figured out when I came to Hollywood. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7094.08s)]
*  I was 27 years old. That was the first time I ever had a nice apartment in my life. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7097.08s)]
*  I had a loft. I had a fucking pool table. I was like this is sick. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7100.08s)]
*  And then I got, and then I'm like oh this is just where I live. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7104.08s)]
*  I felt like oh, that's another trick you gotta be aware of. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7107.08s)]
*  Like this idea of always getting a bigger, better, you never appreciate it. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7110.08s)]
*  It's always just where you live. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7114.08s)]
*  This is all you need. A place that's safe that has a TV. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7116.08s)]
*  You have a kitchen, you have a TV. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7119.08s)]
*  No playground next to you to wake you up. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7121.08s)]
*  Yeah you don't want anything crazy and loud. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7123.08s)]
*  You don't want to hear a train station. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7125.08s)]
*  I'm buying a house and I'm like I'm literally just gonna hang out in two rooms. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7127.08s)]
*  I'm gonna walk from my bed to the fucking couch. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7129.08s)]
*  The only time it changes is if you have a family. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7132.08s)]
*  You have a family, then you want a yard, then you want a pool, then you want a lot of things. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7134.08s)]
*  You want a lot of things. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7137.08s)]
*  Or if you want a dog. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7138.08s)]
*  Yeah you want to have a room and be like ah I don't know where to put this. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7139.08s)]
*  I always had dogs. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7142.08s)]
*  My garage is fucked. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7144.08s)]
*  I've always had dogs so I always have a big yard. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7146.08s)]
*  I'm like that's the thing. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7148.08s)]
*  That's why the only reason I never bought Cresthill. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7150.08s)]
*  The house above the store. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7152.08s)]
*  The Misty House. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7154.08s)]
*  Yes I went to look at it. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7156.08s)]
*  Because it was like Sam Kinnison used to live there. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7158.08s)]
*  This would be crazy to own this fucking house. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7160.08s)]
*  But I had a crazy dog and that yard was too little. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7162.08s)]
*  I was like he'll find a way out. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7165.08s)]
*  Sam Kinnison pissed on Mark Maron's bed up there. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7167.08s)]
*  Nice. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7169.08s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7171.08s)]
*  Imagine if that was on YouTube. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7172.08s)]
*  I have a hundred million views. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7173.08s)]
*  All over his bed just standing up. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7175.08s)]
*  Wow that's a credit. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7178.08s)]
*  Mark his territory. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7180.08s)]
*  That's what your cat does. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7181.08s)]
*  That's why you gotta give him spade. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7182.08s)]
*  Easy. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7186.08s)]
*  Spay and neuter your pets. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7187.08s)]
*  I'm Bob Barker. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7188.08s)]

*  I'm fucking kicking everybody. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7452.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good sign. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7453.08s)]
*  The second I start drinking, I go, would you fucking say, Jamie, about Ohio State, you [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7454.08s)]
*  motherfucker? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7459.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7460.08s)]
*  That's an ass. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7461.08s)]
*  Oh, Jamie, can you bring up Michigan walking into Ohio State Stadium? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7462.08s)]
*  Nice change of subject. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7465.08s)]
*  The thing is, though, I don't think you would do it if you could do it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7466.08s)]
*  True, yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7470.08s)]
*  I guess it humbles the other way. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7471.08s)]
*  Yeah, you don't care. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7472.08s)]
*  I could do it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7473.08s)]
*  I don't do it to anybody. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7474.08s)]
*  That's what I noticed about going to UFCs, the backstage stuff, is they're so quiet [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7475.08s)]
*  and just very chill, meek people. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7478.08s)]
*  Very nice. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7480.08s)]
*  How are you? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7481.08s)]
*  I know Nate a lot. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7482.08s)]
*  He's a different animal now. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7483.08s)]
*  That's also why he's such a superstar. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7486.08s)]
*  Everybody loves him because he's the same guy. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7488.08s)]
*  It's also why he's great fighting. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7490.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7492.08s)]
*  Genuinely, he doesn't give a fuck. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7493.08s)]
*  Leon Edwards is my favorite fight. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7495.08s)]
*  Yeah, when he cracked him in the left hand and pointed at him, I'm like, oh, I got you. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7496.08s)]
*  For four straight rounds, Leon's doing moves, like trying shit. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7500.08s)]
*  Spinning elbow to the forehead and he just goes, oh, we're doing spin shit. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7506.08s)]
*  Fucking gay ass spin. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7511.08s)]
*  Fucking gay bullshit. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7513.08s)]
*  Come here. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7515.08s)]
*  But who won? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7516.08s)]
*  He's trying to come back to the UFC. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7517.08s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7518.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was reading articles. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7519.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's substantiated, but they're looking for it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7520.08s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7523.08s)]
*  That guy is a superstar. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7524.08s)]
*  That guy shows up. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7525.08s)]
*  He'll fight anyone. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7526.08s)]
*  Bro, I always said that he was the most underappreciated superstar during the Conor McGregor times. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7527.08s)]
*  I was like, you guys are missing out. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7532.08s)]
*  Like, you got Conor McGregor, but Nate Diaz just beat him and said, I'm not surprised, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7534.08s)]
*  motherfucker. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7539.08s)]
*  Not just like, I can't believe it. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7540.08s)]
*  It wasn't a Storm the Field guy. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7541.08s)]
*  I'm not surprised, motherfucker. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7543.08s)]
*  That's what he joked out. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7544.08s)]
*  That was what got me into the sport. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7546.08s)]
*  What about this? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7549.08s)]
*  I was at that one with Epstein. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7550.08s)]

*  Epstein. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7555.08s)]
*  This Jiu Jitsu guy. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7556.08s)]
*  He caught a dude in a triangle. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7558.08s)]
*  Caught a dude in a triangle and then did a double flex. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7560.08s)]
*  To the cameras. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7563.08s)]
*  While he had him in the triangle, like fully locked up. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7564.08s)]
*  Einstein, Einstein. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7569.08s)]
*  Damn. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7570.08s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7571.08s)]
*  His name was Einstein? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7572.08s)]
*  Yeah, his name was Einstein. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7573.08s)]
*  Nice going, Einstein. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7574.08s)]
*  I messed up his name. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7575.08s)]
*  What does he do in off season? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7576.08s)]
*  How does he make money? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7577.08s)]
*  Nate? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7578.08s)]
*  Well, he got... [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7579.08s)]
*  He gives bowlers lessons? [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7580.08s)]
*  Something happened. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7581.08s)]
*  He had a boxing match with Jorge Masvidal. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7582.08s)]
*  He won. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7585.08s)]
*  And he won, but they didn't give him the money. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7586.08s)]
*  What? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7589.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7590.08s)]
*  See if that got resolved. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7591.08s)]
*  There was a crazy thing. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7592.08s)]
*  You know, you have these fly by night promotions. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7595.08s)]
*  Sometimes they're not funded correctly. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7597.08s)]
*  Like any black room, like we'll send you the check. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7599.08s)]
*  Give it to me now. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7601.08s)]
*  Give it to me now. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7602.08s)]
*  Whoa, whoa. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7603.08s)]
*  That's the wrong show. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7604.08s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7605.08s)]
*  Jamie, delete all the stuff I said about Hitler. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7607.08s)]
*  I had that with a mob club I used to work for in Connecticut. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7609.08s)]
*  Get paid if you're lucky. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7612.08s)]
*  Yeah, if you're lucky. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7614.08s)]
*  I saw you almost fucking beat a guy in Vancouver Island. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7615.08s)]
*  He's like, I'll send it to you later. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7618.08s)]
*  I've never seen him because the checks were always from him. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7619.08s)]
*  They're coming. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7622.08s)]
*  I was like, give me my money. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7623.08s)]
*  He goes, no, we got to send it. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7624.08s)]
*  He goes, bro. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7625.08s)]
*  He went into the back. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7626.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7627.08s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7628.08s)]
*  Write the check now. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7629.08s)]
*  Pay me now. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7630.08s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was super sketchy talking about his balance and his bull. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7631.08s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7637.08s)]
*  These have to clear. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7638.08s)]
*  Suze reported $9 million. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7639.08s)]
*  So they robbed him out of $9 million. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7641.08s)]
*  Pre-fight deal in place. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7644.08s)]
*  Promoter, blah, blah, blah. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7646.08s)]
*  Yeah, so he beat him, but he's owed $9 million. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7648.08s)]
*  I hope he gets his money. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7651.08s)]
*  He do. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7652.08s)]
*  Yeah, also, he's doing it. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7653.08s)]
*  It's hard to get money on a person who doesn't have any money, though. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7654.08s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7657.08s)]
*  You get an old Ferrari. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7658.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7659.08s)]
*  He could have his stuff. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7660.08s)]
*  But Nate does, they do like Jiu-Jitsu shit. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7661.08s)]
*  They'll do like. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7665.08s)]
*  Seminars. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7666.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7667.08s)]
*  Yeah, he does a lot of seminars. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7668.08s)]
*  He makes plenty of money doing seminars. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7669.08s)]
*  Nate's a legit Jiu-Jitsu black belt. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7671.08s)]
*  Purple. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7673.08s)]
*  They always say purple, right? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7674.08s)]
*  He's always like, as he was doing this, he was like, I'm just a purple belt. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7675.08s)]
*  Shut up, dude. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7679.08s)]
*  Yeah, and his brother was one of the best of all time. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7680.08s)]
*  That was always cool with him, because anytime I've hung out with Nate, I've never hung out [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7684.08s)]
*  with Nick, but he talks about Nick with this reverence. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7688.08s)]
*  There was a time. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7691.08s)]
*  There was a time. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7692.08s)]
*  That I've never seen anything like it. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7693.08s)]
*  People missed it, because most of it happened in the Strike Force days. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7695.08s)]
*  Next. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7698.08s)]
*  Yeah, Nick's Prime. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7699.08s)]
*  Nick's Prime, he was a bad motherfucker, dude. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7701.08s)]
*  He was a terrifying guy, because he had the most insane cardio that's ever existed. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7704.08s)]
*  This guy swam from Alcatraz to the shore. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7708.08s)]
*  He swam five times. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7712.08s)]
*  What? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7714.08s)]
*  I said he twice, and he corrected me on lines. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7715.08s)]
*  He said five times. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7717.08s)]
*  Since then, he's probably swam a bunch more. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7718.08s)]
*  So it's probably like 10 times now. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7720.08s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7721.08s)]
*  He's the only one. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7722.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7723.08s)]
*  Swim from Alcatraz in the ocean with the sharks. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7724.08s)]
*  What? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7727.08s)]
*  The thing that was supposed to keep people from ever escaping that island. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7728.08s)]
*  People voluntarily do it, and he's done it a ton of times. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7730.08s)]
*  Train by day? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7733.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7734.08s)]
*  His cardio was off the charts, and you just couldn't keep his pace. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7735.08s)]
*  He'd put a pace on you and hit you with like 50% punches. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7739.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7741.08s)]
*  50% punches, but constantly having your face wise talking shit. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7742.08s)]
*  What are you going to do, bitch? [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7744.08s)]
*  What are you going to do, bitch? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7745.08s)]
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and then every now and then rip one to the body. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7746.08s)]
*  Rip one to the body. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7749.08s)]
*  Pop, pop, pop, and you're exhausted, and you can't breathe, because when someone's punching you, you can't take a breath. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7750.08s)]
*  So even if he's only punching you like this, you're all tense. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7755.08s)]
*  He's relaxed. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7760.08s)]
*  He's a better boxer than you. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7761.08s)]
*  He's better at jujitsu. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7763.08s)]
*  So what are you going to do, take him down? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7764.08s)]
*  Like what are you going to do? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7765.08s)]
*  How did he ever lose when he lost? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7766.08s)]
*  It got to a point where later in his career, everybody slows down. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7768.08s)]
*  But in StrikeForce, he was in his prime. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7774.08s)]
*  Like Frank Shamrock, Nick Diaz versus Frank Shamrock in StrikeForce is a great example. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7776.08s)]
*  Whoa, that's a fight. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7782.08s)]
*  He beat Shamrock. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7783.08s)]
*  Oh, he beat his ass. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7784.08s)]
*  But when he lost in his prime, how did he lose? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7785.08s)]
*  Well, he didn't really lose in his prime. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7787.08s)]
*  He might have lost a couple of decisions in his prime in like three rounders. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7790.08s)]
*  I'd have to like go back and look at it. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7794.08s)]
*  But like he submitted Gomi, which is like this huge thing in Pride with a go-go plot, like off of his back while he was high. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7796.08s)]
*  He tested positive so, he tested so positive after the fight that like he had to be fighting high. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7803.08s)]
*  Damn. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=7810.08s)]

*  The only reason I stopped the booze [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8411.58s)]
*  Is because I wanted to see what it would be like [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8413.58s)]

*  Let's figure this out [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8976.14s)]
*  According to the fire a website [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8977.82s)]
*  It says that all direct donations will be distributed under the advisement of the Annenberg Foundation [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8979.539999999999s)]
*  According to the IRS 990 form the Annenberg Foundation 501 c3 based in Concangin, Pennsylvania [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8985.98s)]
*  I live there conch you baby office building one massive red flag [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8992.1s)]
*  33 percent of their annual expenses goes towards actual charity programs [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=8997.380000000001s)]
*  The rest goes to administrative costs like executive compensation [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9002.74s)]
*  Look at the numbers. They treat you pretty good over there starting with top dog Cynthia canard [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9006.86s)]
*  Who's making three-quarters of a million dollars plus another six figures in bonuses [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9011.460000000001s)]
*  She started the fire basically almost seven figures just for one person there here is Cynthia aka [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9017.460000000001s)]
*  Sinny hanging out with Gavin Newsom dissenting or strategizing about any [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9023.58s)]
*  Anyway, just to give you a point of comparison with another nonprofit doctors without borders [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9033.5s)]
*  They spent almost 90 percent of their money on actual programs versus less than 1% on administrative costs [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9038.02s)]
*  Local journalists have also been asking where's the money they found quote the fire aid website names only three palisades organizations that receive grants [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9045.380000000001s)]
*  among almost 120 organizations [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9053.7s)]
*  Why'd you stop because he focused on the palisades just display it [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9060.78s)]
*  We'll talk later specific to [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9064.18s)]
*  What's Israel those three are? [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9067.06s)]
*  Khele Israel Habbad of Pacific Palisades and Palisades Charter High School. Listen scorpions thing directly [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9069.26s)]
*  Foundation they were kind of given the runaround various extension numbers somebody saying they would call them back. No one called back [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9076.42s)]
*  To some mysterious man named Philip no last name. He was never found [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9083.54s)]
*  This is just crazy [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9088.62s)]
*  So essentially what they're doing is taking the hundred million dollars then paying themselves roughly 70% of it Wow [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9089.94s)]
*  The rest of the money they're dishing out to various other nonprofits with their own administrative expenses [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9096.140000000001s)]
*  And that's how a hundred million dollars just ends up [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9101.62s)]
*  Disappearing. Oh, yeah. Yay. Wow [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9106.380000000001s)]
*  Okay [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9108.9s)]
*  Maybe he's telling the truth. Maybe he's exaggerating but the very least [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9111.7s)]
*  The NFL does cancer research stuff 70% goes administration 30% goes to the actual cross these nonprofits, that's crazy [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9115.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're for their own profit [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9123.94s)]
*  It's a loophole [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9127.94s)]
*  But they found a loophole to make a great living by being virtuous and then they see a fire like shake we're all getting raises [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9128.94s)]
*  But all we're saying Jamie is that this guy is saying that 70% traditionally [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9136.22s)]
*  Goes to administrative costs 30% goes to the actual problem [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9141.66s)]
*  That's for all charities [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9146.3s)]
*  But if right that is for all charities for a lot of charities, but not doctors without borders [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9147.1s)]
*  Which is one of the things that he brought up picked one though [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9151.58s)]
*  But be comparing you at this stuff to just like I'll pick a charity and this he picked the problem one of the worst ones [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9154.3s)]
*  You know, we've gone over the charity stuff many times [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9159.34s)]
*  There's right and bad charity. There's good and bad charities [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9161.34s)]
*  But the point is that this hundred million dollars you're saying was distributed to a bunch of different places [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9164.3s)]
*  Not just Pacific Palisades looking into it to a hundred million was a number that got used in advertising to make everything look big and look good [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9170.18s)]
*  Probably I was my part I was trying to say to assuming that it is a hundred million [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9178.300000000001s)]
*  There's a bunch of companies and a bunch of like artists and said I'm gonna pledge a million [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9181.74s)]
*  I'm gonna pledge a million they never and you have to go collect at all [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9185.02s)]
*  You don't know if they all send it in. Oh, you know how many times I pledge stuff [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDBFFgs6Ifs&t=9187.94s)]
