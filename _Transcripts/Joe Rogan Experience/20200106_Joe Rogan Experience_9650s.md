# Joe Rogan Experience #1406 - Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joGS1O-Uto4)
*  Hello Brian.
*  Hello Joe.
*  Happy New Year.
*  Happy 2020.
*  Happy 2020.
*  That doesn't sound real.
*  2020 sounds like a fake number.
*  Like we're in the year 2020.
*  That's like a movie about the future.
*  Yeah.
*  We've already gone past the Blade Runner date, you know.
*  When was the Blade Runner date?
*  I think that was September, October of last year.
*  You know what's interesting about the estimations about the future?
*  No one ever overestimates or underestimates.
*  Everyone overestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone underestimates.
*  Everyone overestimates.
*  Right?
*  Like Space 1999.
*  Remember that show?
*  Yep.
*  That was a, I'm older than you, but when that show was on TV, people thought that in 1999
*  we'd be just fucking flying around through space all the time and living out there.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Buck Rogers.
*  Yeah.
*  All those, all those shows.
*  Like, so Blade Runner was what year?
*  This last year, 2019.
*  Wow.
*  They missed that, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's funny when they show it in the movie, it shows like the background looks
*  like flying cars and like crazy billboards and everything.
*  I wonder where technology would be if it wasn't for the internet.
*  Imagine if the internet was not possible, but technology still advanced electronically.
*  Like the capability of showing higher resolution images and processing power and all that stuff
*  kept moving, but they never figured out how to link it all up.
*  Yeah.
*  That's weird.
*  That's the scariest thing about the internet.
*  It's almost like they put, like the future put ideas in people's heads and those people
*  just started figuring out a way to connect everybody and then connect all this crazy
*  computing power and all this information and you could translate it in real time and do
*  it all around the world.
*  And what a better way to get the technology to advance.
*  Because if it wasn't for the internet, how much, where would we be at realistically?
*  Would still be racist, would still be molesting people at work, nuclear bombs.
*  Would still have radio, would still have TV.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's what's causing all the problems in Hollywood and everything in life.
*  And look at all this stuff that's going on right now with Trump and everything like that.
*  It's the internet getting together going, no, this is wrong, this is right.
*  It's people becoming gangs immediately.
*  I think it's a side effect of something that's ultimately going to be good.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think we're learning how to figure it out.
*  But I think ultimately it's going to be good.
*  Because what it is, is like everybody gets to have an opinion.
*  And through those opinions you find out which ones make any sense, which ones are crazy.
*  But like right now it's like the people that are really into expressing their opinions
*  on both sides are usually the ones that everybody else is like, hey, hey, hey, fucking relax,
*  man.
*  Like, isn't it?
*  I think most of us have some sort of a middle ground on almost everything.
*  But that's not represented right now because right now it's like the most extreme people
*  are the ones who are putting the most energy into talking about things.
*  Like this Greta Thunberg girl, do they have to go to her every time anybody says anything
*  wrong about the climate?
*  Because apparently Meat Loaf said something.
*  What did Meat Loaf say?
*  Well, he said something about her specifically.
*  I think he said-
*  Did he?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I thought he had a cli- the headline I read, and I'm a fucking sucker for clickbait,
*  and said he had climate denial comments.
*  He just said something like relax.
*  He pretty much like kind of did that passive aggressive thing like chill out lady.
*  It's probably being funny.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we do.
*  You took what-
*  I do feel kind of bad for her.
*  I think it's hilarious.
*  Like imagine all the other girls in school.
*  What did they think about her?
*  You know, like-
*  I have a friend who worked with autistic people and she said she thinks she's autistic.
*  She thinks that this situation is like a really bright child that maybe is being like pushed
*  in this direction to be this public figure.
*  It's just her- it's not that her opinions aren't valid.
*  They definitely are valid, but it's just it's not healthy to take a young kid who's developing
*  and then thrust them into the front of something like global climate change debate.
*  It's so hostile.
*  And then just instantaneously this kid is getting mocked and fucked with and then they're
*  asking her to make statements and how dare you that how dare you just plays over and
*  over and over again.
*  Like she's not wrong.
*  It's not wrong her opinions, but it's like she's really young to handle this.
*  I don't know if she's autistic.
*  She seems very very smart.
*  Is she like this all day?
*  That's a good question.
*  Like when you think of autism, don't you like almost immediately think they're probably
*  really smart at something?
*  Oh yeah, absolutely.
*  Is that from brain man or is that accurate?
*  No, that's accurate.
*  That's why the government uses them to for their military for like radars and stuff because
*  they're very smart at one certain thing or a few certain things.
*  You know, accuracy is another one that I think a lot of them are smart at.
*  Do one time when I was really high, I had a crazy thought about autism and that all
*  these spectrum disorders are eventually going to make emotions like a less significant aspect
*  of being a human being.
*  You know, some people, some people, they don't have any control over their emotions, right?
*  They just they fly off the handle.
*  They're nutty.
*  They cry.
*  They scream.
*  It's it varies right with all of us.
*  Wouldn't it be like more efficient if that wasn't the case anymore?
*  Like if it was like it like an appendix, you know, we had an appendix, we had an organ
*  that we used to use to pro what is it like processing roots and shit or bark?
*  Bone was it bone?
*  Yeah, I thought it was like breaking down bones, something we don't use anymore because
*  of our diet change.
*  Like imagine if your emotions become something like that.
*  Like some people have emotional flare ups like, oh, that guy blew out his appendix.
*  He just had a fucking hissy fit at his brother's wedding.
*  Fuck no.
*  Fuck you, man.
*  Dad always fucking said which one of the pill was Xanax or Prozac makes you just numb to
*  like thoughts Xanax.
*  I think Xanax is the anti relaxant one.
*  Prozac's a speed, right?
*  Or anti anxiety one.
*  Xanax is anti anxiety, right?
*  I think so, yeah.
*  So like just pure Xanax all the time.
*  Somebody told me that if you take that, when you get off of it, it accentuates the anxiety.
*  Like once you get out, there's all the rubber band effect.
*  But then a doctor told me that's horseshit.
*  So I'm gonna go with the doctor.
*  But so many people, maybe it's because they forgot how bad anxiety is and then they get
*  it back like fuck.
*  And you like maybe because you took a break and you know what it's like to not have anxiety,
*  then the reality of being on the natch is just even more discomforting.
*  A lot of people take Xanax to come down from bad trips or like if they get too stoned or
*  too like fucked up on mushrooms or something.
*  Good call.
*  I don't think I've ever done Xanax.
*  Have you done Xanax?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No, but I didn't even know that I had a problem with anxiety until I started taking CBD.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Once I started taking CBD oil, I was like, wow, I feel great.
*  How much CBD?
*  What's your normal CBD?
*  Like what do you take?
*  I do a lot of lotions.
*  I use a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different kinds of stuff.
*  Some of them are gummies.
*  But mostly I like oil.
*  And CBDMD is one of the sponsors.
*  They sent me a bunch of their stuff.
*  It's great.
*  I squirt it under my tongue.
*  Yeah, I like that stuff.
*  I just chill out.
*  It just does something to you where it's not getting you high, but it is giving you like
*  this feeling of lightness.
*  There's a little bit, just a little bit, just a little relax.
*  And it's, you know, Dave Foley had really fucked up arthritis.
*  And CBD tincture, CBD oil, completely fixed it.
*  Just oral CBD.
*  He used to not be able to straighten his fingers out just from fucking arthritis.
*  Yeah, I used it on my leg when I pulled my sciatica or whatever that shit's called.
*  And it helped with that actually.
*  Dude, I've done that many times.
*  Sciatica.
*  I've never done that.
*  That was one of the worst things ever, man.
*  I couldn't sleep.
*  You know what it is?
*  It's most of the time it's an injury in your back.
*  And it goes down your leg.
*  But what it is is your back, somewhere in your back.
*  I'm like an expert on being able to butcher scientific explanations for medical conditions.
*  But if I was going to do my best to get it right, I would say it's your disc bulges out
*  and hits the nerve.
*  And it hurts.
*  And the way it hurts, it goes down your leg.
*  So you think like you pulled something in your leg, but it's really something in your
*  back.
*  You know, and I was experiencing it really recently, man.
*  And I went and got, you know what Regenekine is?
*  I told you about that shit before, right?
*  They used to do it in Germany.
*  They was a blood spinning procedure.
*  They still do it in Germany, but now they do it in Santa Monica too.
*  And it's a blood spinning procedure.
*  It's like platelet rich plasma, but they put some other stuff in it.
*  I know we've discussed the science behind it.
*  Anyway, it's amazing at that.
*  And like relaxing all the area around a disc and anything that's bulging sort of goes back
*  in and fixes itself.
*  It really can happen.
*  You don't necessarily have to get surgery with a lot of people.
*  Some people that have your situation or my situation, they get surgery because the disc
*  keeps poking out.
*  They say, we're just going to cut a piece out of that.
*  And it can help you.
*  I think mine might be stemming from my bad knee somehow because mine happened right after
*  I injured my knee again the other couple months ago.
*  Yeah, you're probably favoring one side.
*  You know, if you favor one side.
*  It's definitely weaker.
*  Like I need to, is that the growth hormone, do you still have to go to like, not growth,
*  the baby, dead baby juice?
*  Stem cells?
*  Stem cells.
*  Do you still have to go to like Mexico for that?
*  No, you can do it in America for sure.
*  And as an added bonus, they'll do it, maybe get out of your own fat.
*  Oh, right?
*  Yeah, bro.
*  They'll light by you a little bit, get them to sculpt you some six pack.
*  I'm going to have a lot.
*  I'm going to have a lot.
*  I'm going to start selling it.
*  We'll see you at the store.
*  You'll be like 150 pounds.
*  I'll be like, what happened, Red Band?
*  Stem cells.
*  Yeah.
*  I got for everybody who needs stem cells.
*  And I didn't even know that you could use plasma.
*  I always sold plasma.
*  I didn't know you could like keep it and use it for good.
*  Well, this platelet rich plasma, again, I'll fuck this up royally if I try to actually
*  explain it, but they take your blood out and they spin it.
*  And somehow or another by spinning it, it separates through a centrifuge.
*  It separates like this yellow stuff that's like, there's the platelets and there's this
*  other stuff like that.
*  There's like significant parts to blood.
*  All right.
*  So they take this platelet rich plasma.
*  How the fuck they do this?
*  The difference between that like regular PRP and Regenekine is some other factors.
*  So they squirt that yellow serum into your back.
*  It's not cheap.
*  It's not covered by insurance, but goddamn does it work.
*  It works way better than I mean, it's like you got a belging.
*  Like usually if you have a bulging disc, you're kind of fucked, you know, because people are
*  like, God damn, what can I do?
*  And they go, well, exercise, yoga, there's some things they take a long time.
*  You can slowly get things better.
*  You can get an epidural.
*  It'll kill the pain.
*  Sometimes that helps relax everything.
*  But this shit fixes it.
*  That'd be a good company to invest in.
*  You just need a doctor and a machine to do it like.
*  It's a little more complicated than that, Brian.
*  You need actual scientists, lab technicians.
*  Maybe it's just a machine.
*  It might be just a spinning machine that takes plasma and makes it like a latte out of it.
*  Jamie, what were you going to tell me about Epstein right before the show started?
*  I was going to tell you this.
*  All right.
*  So let me draw a picture.
*  Something happened?
*  Last night during the Golden Globes going on, there were some jokes going on by Ricky
*  Gervais that we'll probably talk about later.
*  But 60 Minutes was probably going on a different channel at the same time.
*  And they had a report with some new evidence that nobody has seen yet.
*  They have some autopsy photos and photos from inside a cell.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah, the photo.
*  Are the photos online?
*  Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.
*  Of course they are.
*  Yeah, I didn't know this was just released.
*  I saw this last night and I saw one of the photos and it looks real.
*  So I watched the 15 minutes that they put together, which is mostly just about the incident
*  in the cell and surrounding it.
*  I'm just going to show you the pictures though because we can't watch their thing.
*  Let me try to get the 13 images.
*  Am I scared?
*  No, I mean it's just...
*  I'm scared already.
*  I'm scared already because of Iran.
*  I don't want to be scared of this video of them whacking this dude.
*  You know they whacked him, yes.
*  That's 100%.
*  The fact that they thought they could get away with that, that's so crazy.
*  That is such a crazy thing to try to get away with.
*  This gigantic international case.
*  Hey, what happened to the cameras?
*  Oh, I'm fucking broke, man.
*  I don't know.
*  Sucks.
*  Got to hang himself.
*  They needed a couple days to make the videos and stuff like that.
*  Bro, he tried.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's the problem with today.
*  These are so fake.
*  He was trying to hang himself before.
*  And they're like, hey, don't do that again.
*  And he's like, all right, I won't.
*  Give me my belt.
*  Give me my shoelaces.
*  Give me whatever the fuck that guy strangled me with.
*  These photos are all fake, right?
*  No, no, no.
*  Hold on.
*  I mean, they're very realistic.
*  We need Eddie Bravo in here immediately.
*  Okay, here we go.
*  Pull this up here.
*  This is from his cell.
*  This is inside there.
*  I'll put these up on the screen.
*  This was the cell he was in by himself.
*  Okay.
*  He used a bunch of these orange jumpsuits, which I guess were already in there.
*  He tied them around his head?
*  I guess.
*  There is a little spot way up here on the top of the grate where the window is, where
*  you could see maybe there was something up there.
*  But the thing to remember here is that he was about six foot tall, 185 pounds.
*  There's one other thing on this ladder here.
*  There is also some other things I'll get into in just a second that would be easier to use
*  than tying all this shit together.
*  But they showed, there's the other thing here was this.
*  This is about four feet off the ground.
*  And they do show a noose, which they're saying was what he used.
*  But as the doctor sort of said that the noose that they show a picture of, which is what
*  you can see in the top right corner here.
*  Oh, that's Dr. Michael Baden.
*  That's that guy from the HBO Autospy Show.
*  For some reason I can't, I'll find it in a second, but the picture that shows his actual
*  neck doesn't seem like this noose caused that wound.
*  And it's a little bit lower than it probably should have been.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  So, they're showing some of these other, these are some of the pictures of him.
*  This is the bone, his jaw, the hoi, hoi-lio bone.
*  His jaw was broken?
*  Well, there's that fracture that they said wasn't consistent with hanging.
*  It's more consistent with a murder or homicide.
*  And he said, this is Baden's words, is that usually he's seen it in maybe like one bone
*  break and sometimes two, but there were three fractures.
*  He says like he's almost never seen that in any of his cases he's ever looked over.
*  Hmm.
*  And you would think it would be, if you're going to hang yourself from such a short distance,
*  it would be even harder to get a fracture like that, right?
*  Because you're not like jumping out like in an old western movie, like Clint Eastwood
*  movie when they would hang him, hang him high.
*  So the one thing that they also had in here was he left a note.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  The note said like, there was like four things.
*  It said first that the, it had the name blurred out, but it said this person left him in a
*  shower locked for an hour.
*  It then said someone else gave him like burnt food and then bugs were crawling over his
*  hands and then he just wrote no fun.
*  But there's a ballpoint pen, like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to it.
*  Like if you knew he was on suicide watch, you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that
*  he could kill himself with.
*  Jamie, you should be a goddamn detective for CSI.
*  This is what they're saying.
*  And he had his, his sleep apium machine was in there.
*  You could see an extension cord coming from the hallway into his room that he could have
*  just used that to kill himself and hang himself.
*  Or the nine jumpsuits.
*  Why does he have nine jumpsuits?
*  Yeah, the jumpsuit thing is freaky.
*  Like they're trying to explain it by bringing in some, some new witness.
*  So somehow this is actually a different video that's shown a couple of different things
*  than what I saw this morning.
*  I didn't see this arm thing and I didn't see the picture of his back.
*  The arm thing looks like an injection spot.
*  Is that what it looks like?
*  I guess so.
*  Here's the actual, this is what I saw.
*  Here's the note.
*  What does it say?
*  Sorry.
*  It says, it's not 60 minutes.
*  Get their watermark all over it.
*  It's so funny.
*  Sorry, 60 minutes.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for getting this.
*  So it says, kept me in a locked, it's blurred right here.
*  It says the name is bored.
*  Kept me in a locked shower stall for one hour.
*  Neck or someone, I don't know the name, send in burnt food, giant bugs crawled on my hands
*  and then no fun.
*  And then they're saying, and then he killed him.
*  But then this ballpoint pen was next to it that he could have stabbed himself in the
*  neck or whatever.
*  Yeah, it's hard to kill yourself with a pen.
*  Yeah.
*  But.
*  Do they get pens?
*  That's not usually, but this is like a, you know.
*  High profile case.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  It's just.
*  Yeah, I don't think you should have a pen.
*  Look, it's bad to say either way if you don't know.
*  And I'm guilty of that 100%.
*  I'm like, that guy didn't kill himself.
*  I am talking shit though.
*  I'm not talking in terms of like, we have to understand.
*  This is really important.
*  We're doing a podcast.
*  When you're doing a podcast, you don't have to be factually accurate.
*  You just have to talk shit.
*  And hopefully if you fuck up, you correct it.
*  And it's funny.
*  I'm not a science expert, but when these guys are saying that the guy died by strangulation,
*  there's all these points of consistent strangulation that it takes forever to get these pictures.
*  And then there's the video cameras didn't work.
*  And this is the second time he tried to kill himself.
*  And he's a high profile witness in a really, really, really important case involving pedophiles
*  at the highest levels of government.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't.
*  I would think that that's the kind of guy you whack.
*  You're also according to the procedure, you're not when there's a suicide there, you're not
*  supposed to remove the body and take it to the emergency room.
*  You're supposed to treat it as though it was a murder or like a crime scene.
*  What's crazy is it's so high profile, like even is in because this is most likely how
*  they did it forever.
*  Right?
*  Like people that whack people, they were probably like, you know, I was doing comedy before
*  the internet.
*  They're probably whacking people before the internet.
*  Right?
*  Do you want to see I found the graphic image?
*  Sure.
*  Oh, yeah, I'm not sure.
*  See if you don't see it, Brian.
*  I saw that.
*  I hear some weird texture on his cheek, I thought.
*  Interesting, Brian.
*  Like, like bed marks almost like he was.
*  I think that's just the blood rushing to his head.
*  Bro, that guy got strangled.
*  That looks like a strangled guy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I thought.
*  But the thing is like, did they clean him?
*  There's no blood on that noose that they said was the noose that did it.
*  But there's blood on his body.
*  And there's no pictures of him in the cell.
*  They didn't take any pictures of that.
*  Hold on.
*  There's no blood on the noose they said killed him, but yet there's blood on his neck?
*  Correct.
*  That was pointed out by the reporter in the scene.
*  That's insane.
*  That's impossible.
*  Did they really do a test of the rope that they supposedly said hung him?
*  They just showed a picture of it and it looks very clean and unused.
*  Well, it is orange.
*  Maybe the red doesn't show up that clean on orange.
*  Can we look at it again?
*  I think we should probably.
*  Look, I want to say for sure they killed him.
*  And the lawyer she's talking to and the piece is his former cellmate's lawyer.
*  And he's just, I don't know.
*  It's obviously...
*  Bro, the former cellmate is my favorite part of the story.
*  A gigantic ex-cop who was a murderer and a drug dealer.
*  And he's fucking huge.
*  He's a gorilla.
*  A straight up gorilla.
*  Big Italian gorilla.
*  And they put him in jail with that guy?
*  Come on, man.
*  They probably...
*  Oh, come on.
*  Look at his neck.
*  Okay, so they're examining the thing.
*  This is Dr. Michael Batten from HBO.
*  And he's examining the thing that was supposedly used to kill him and he's saying there's
*  nothing on it.
*  And he's showing the actual lacerations around the neck that show clear blood.
*  And he said it's too low on the neck too?
*  That's her postulation right here.
*  She says if he did what you thought, which would have been leaning forward on the ground,
*  that it probably would have been a little higher under the jaw.
*  Not down at the base of the neck, kind of.
*  But that's a little bit tough to say.
*  I would imagine if you're killing somebody like that, they're trying to get away.
*  People that are trying to get away do that.
*  If you're killing them from behind, if that guy's holding them down...
*  Oh, come on, man.
*  Look at his neck.
*  Hmm.
*  So.
*  Hold on though.
*  Is any of that break actually breaking the skin?
*  The thing is it looks like a wire.
*  It looks like a wire to me.
*  It does look like a wire.
*  That's right.
*  It looks way too thin to be that...
*  Yeah.
*  That thick thing.
*  That thick thing.
*  Cloth noose.
*  I mean, maybe that thick noose thing is really strong fabric.
*  But that looks like a wire to me, man.
*  But wouldn't a wire just slice right into your neck too?
*  Yeah.
*  That's more like blood rising to the skin than an actual cut.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
*  It looked before though like it was a cut.
*  So maybe there wasn't really that much blood that actually came through the skin.
*  And maybe all that cloth just...
*  Maybe it's really thin and it gets down like a wire.
*  Like if you choke somebody with like a bandana, you know, like if you had like one of them
*  bandanas that hippies put on their dogs and you choke someone to death with one of those
*  I got to think it's going to make a very small mark.
*  I don't think it's going to make a thick mark.
*  If you like got someone in like an Ezekiel choke with one of those things and fucking
*  yeah, that's a strong...
*  It would get thin like where it was choking you like the actual point.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Would that make a mark like that?
*  I'm sure someone now is going to go start myth busting like how to what it looks like
*  if you do do that test and like...
*  They have to murder someone to find out if it's true.
*  Just get another piece of shit.
*  We'll find out later today, I'm sure.
*  The whole thing is so strange, man.
*  It's so public.
*  The idea that a guy actually had a fuck island.
*  So that's what Ricky Gervais was joking about last night.
*  Did you watch that?
*  Of course he was.
*  No, but I did see the one clip that somebody put on the internet about him saying don't
*  virtue signal.
*  Just come out here and get a little prize.
*  Go fuck off because nobody cares about your opinion.
*  I was like, thank you.
*  Thank you, Ricky.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank God.
*  That guy swings.
*  You're swinging from the hip.
*  Chin up.
*  Doesn't give a fuck.
*  Telling it like it is.
*  I love it.
*  He went after Apple in front of Tim Cook.
*  Dude.
*  How crazy was that shit?
*  He went after Apple.
*  Then he said if ISIS opened up a studio, you'd all be sending your resumes.
*  Is that what he said?
*  Something more?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You'd all be like streaming service.
*  You'll be contacting your agents or something.
*  Yeah, that's what he said.
*  Like fuck, man.
*  Good for him.
*  So those are all pre-written, right?
*  Because they had to have those cuts ready to go.
*  I don't know, man.
*  He's so badass.
*  He might be able to do whatever the fuck he wants.
*  He's Ricky Gervais.
*  He's got the ability to probably say, oh, I'll do it.
*  But I'll do it this way.
*  And only this way.
*  And they're like, OK, Ricky, we love you.
*  We love you.
*  We know you wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our amazing organization.
*  We all love working with you here at the Golden Gloves.
*  And it's fun.
*  You stir people up.
*  Everybody knows you're a good guy.
*  And then he goes and hits him with genocide talk.
*  Like, hey, hey, hey.
*  People must have been so pissed.
*  We're just getting away with using all that slave labor and nobody even noticed.
*  That's I mean, it's another thing like this murder, right?
*  It's like that's just how everything was done.
*  That's just how everything was done.
*  That's how they whacked everybody.
*  And that was how you got things built cheap.
*  They use slave labor.
*  But nobody knew.
*  Nobody really understood until you saw things like Foxconn.
*  You were like, wait a minute, this is a good setup?
*  You guys are working 16 hours a day.
*  You sleep in the building.
*  This is a good place.
*  This is good.
*  The stories appear.
*  Amazon workers like running around and peeing themselves.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They have some crazy countdown thing that goes when they get an order and they have
*  to run to go get it.
*  Probably a fun job if you're into losing weight.
*  Put on some ankle weights and shit, maybe a weight vest and just run around that thing.
*  You'd get a fucking vicious workout.
*  That's making lemonade out of lemons.
*  That's right.
*  Everything's a workout.
*  You could be working as a waiter at Applebee's and that's a workout.
*  That's right.
*  Think about it, man.
*  Just with heavy weights are on your waist that no one would notice.
*  You could have a good workout while you're working.
*  The Apple thing, that had to sting.
*  Well, he was standing right, sitting right there too.
*  They show him right before he starts saying it.
*  But he did throw in the Amazon.
*  What exactly did he say?
*  Something about using sweatshops and stuff like that right in front of him.
*  But I mean, Foxconn, it's a sweatshop but it's probably the best version of a sweatshop.
*  It's a real company and it's not-
*  The best version of a sweatshop is hilarious.
*  Foxconn works in the United States now, don't they?
*  Right.
*  Do they?
*  Yeah.
*  I think they actually have or they're about to have companies here in the United States.
*  I remember, this is something that Trump had talked about, right?
*  On top of the annual, Gervais ended his monologue by telling the nominees, so if you do win
*  an award tonight, don't use it as a political platform to make a political speech.
*  You're in no position to lecture the public about anything.
*  You know nothing about the real world.
*  Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.
*  So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god and fuck
*  off, okay?
*  Oh, the swear was beeped out by NBC.
*  He also was, he was also beeped for his use of profanity in two other jokes.
*  One where he called cats James Corden a fat pussy.
*  And another where he discussed the same films, Judi Dench licking her ass.
*  Wow.
*  The comedian, however, also peppered the monologue with references to Me Too and contemporary
*  issues.
*  By noting it was his fifth time hosting and therefore he didn't care what flack he would
*  take.
*  Then he punched in with a nod to last year's college admission scandal.
*  I came here in a limo tonight and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman.
*  Good for him.
*  He's a real comic.
*  He doesn't have the Apple quote.
*  He's a real comic.
*  That's a good, look, they're right down.
*  It's down a little.
*  It's a little lower than that.
*  Apple TV.
*  Yeah.
*  While discussing the addition of Apple TV Plus to the room, Gervais noted the irony
*  of a Me Too themed show like The Morning Show being made by a company who runs flet shops
*  in China.
*  You say you're woke, but if ICE had started a streaming service, you'd call your agent.
*  Yikes.
*  We're going to get this right, folks.
*  I really believe this.
*  Good for you.
*  This is what we were talking about earlier about everything being bad.
*  I don't think it is.
*  I think it's just a lot of noise.
*  There's a lot of noise.
*  A lot of people yelling.
*  It's swinging back around already.
*  It's swinging back around.
*  We're human.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, we have weird things.
*  Everything's changed.
*  It's all changed now.
*  Everything's changed.
*  Okay.
*  Relax.
*  We're okay.
*  We're going to be all right.
*  The world's fucked.
*  We're fucked.
*  It's all ending.
*  I'm a little nervous about Iran, though.
*  That seems like real shit.
*  That makes me want to get educated on the subject so I could really freak out.
*  The one thing that made me feel better is when they were screaming, death to America,
*  death to America, recently, the president of Iran was like, well, when we say death
*  to America, we don't mean the citizens.
*  We like the citizens.
*  We're talking about fuck you, Donald Trump, you know.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  They've been saying that for a long time.
*  That death to America chant, that's been around.
*  Right.
*  That's a tough sell.
*  Yeah.
*  We know what you're saying.
*  You're saying death to America.
*  Okay.
*  That's one thing that you don't want to be misconstrued.
*  If you want to fucking make signs and yell, like you don't like, you're like, hey, hey,
*  we're not talking death, death guys, right?
*  Oh, yeah, definitely not death, death.
*  Let's go out and scream death to America.
*  Everyone's going to know.
*  That'd be the worst way to communicate something.
*  Why you don't really think that?
*  Why would you say death to the American political system, death to the American military complex,
*  not death to America?
*  Right.
*  That's America's everybody.
*  How they got us all mixed.
*  We don't have nothing to do with this, guys.
*  We're just over here chilling.
*  How they got us messed up in some international conflict that you actually have to think about,
*  might come and knock it on your door.
*  What fucking ineptitude mixed with scumbaggery led us to this position?
*  Who did this?
*  Is it the Iranian guys?
*  Did Trump do something he shouldn't have done?
*  Doesn't it seem weird timing though with this whole impeachment shit?
*  It's all weird, dude.
*  It's all weird.
*  The fact that Trump can kill people.
*  Just understand how crazy it is that you got a guy like Trump who could just go, send it
*  in, send the missile, just shoot missiles.
*  He could just, listen man, don't give me that power either.
*  Don't give anybody that power for sure.
*  But a guy like Trump, guy who's famous for being mean to people on a reality show, you're
*  fired, famous for being a baller.
*  I mean, that's what he's famous for.
*  That's the crazy thing.
*  He was in rap songs all the time in like a complimentary way.
*  That guy's life has gone through an arch.
*  Home Alone 2.
*  He was in Home Alone 2.
*  And in Canada, those silly fucks, they edited it out.
*  The CBC edited out the Donald Trump scene because it's offensive.
*  Offensive to us who really enjoy films without monsters.
*  That's history.
*  When you go into fucking Naked Gun and get rid of OJ, what are you going to do?
*  What are you going to do?
*  You're going to take OJ out of the NFL archives?
*  What are you going to do?
*  No, this is life.
*  You can't make life prettier by pulling Donald Trump out of Home Alone.
*  You're supposed to look at it and go, holy shit, who would have thought that fucking
*  guy would be the president one day and be killing dudes and maybe starting World War
*  III, like a goddamn Stephen King novel.
*  You know, Stephen King's freaked out by Trump.
*  These media posts.
*  Oh, what happened there?
*  These media posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should
*  Iran strike any US person or target, the United States will click quickly and fully strike
*  back and perhaps in a disproportionate manner.
*  Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless.
*  Dude, fuck this.
*  That I don't like to see on Twitter.
*  That seems so bizarre.
*  That almost seems like the simulation theory has hired like comedy writers to come in and
*  subtly fuck with everybody.
*  That he can just put that on Twitter?
*  How can he just put that on Twitter?
*  Like I thought there was a series of checks and balances.
*  You know, I mean, this is ultimately like one guy can have like an instantaneous press
*  conference anytime he wants just by putting something on Twitter.
*  And then there's all these people that go, you got to ban him for Twitter.
*  But here's the problem.
*  You ban him from Twitter.
*  Gab is going to, he'll go to Gab, right?
*  If he goes to Gab, Gab all of a sudden skyrocket because everyone's going to want to go to
*  Gab to see Trump talk shit on Gab where it's full freedom of speech.
*  What if he starts swearing on Gab?
*  What if they make a deal with him?
*  What if they give him 50% of Gab because they think it's imminent because of this war we're
*  in with Iran?
*  This could be a movie where they're going to ban him from Twitter and Vidya and Jack
*  Dorsey has to leave.
*  He's in a meditation, a silent meditation in fucking Bali and he has to fly in and he
*  has to figure out whether or not they can make this executive decision to ban Trump.
*  But everybody's calling for it.
*  Ban Trump, ban Trump, ban him, ban him.
*  And then if they banned him off Twitter, imagine if you went to the thing and the page said
*  banned you would just open up your windows and hear liberals cheering.
*  Like King Kong just fell off the Empire State Building.
*  Yes, he's fucking banned.
*  The YouTube videos would be spectacular.
*  Do you know how many virtue signaling dipshits would have YouTube videos just screaming and
*  pumping their fists in the air and pointing to the screen with Donald Trump and says owned?
*  You know how many it would be?
*  It would be hilarious.
*  And all he would have to do is do that and go over somewhere else.
*  And that new platform would be fucking gigantic because everybody would want to know what
*  he says.
*  And if you visit over there, everybody else would just retweet it on Twitter anyway.
*  It would probably be like killing coyotes.
*  You know how you kill coyotes and then they make more coyotes like a female when they
*  shout out.
*  That's like a roll call.
*  And if someone's missing, the female makes more babies.
*  That's one of the craziest things about coyotes.
*  That's why they're everywhere.
*  That's what would happen with Trump.
*  If they banned him off Twitter, his signal would be bigger than ever.
*  It would be fucking bonkers.
*  They're in a precarious situation now too because these social media companies, they're
*  being labeled as someone who would ban freedom of speech from certain people if they don't
*  believe what their ideas.
*  Now, if this happens to be the president, that they say you can't have freedom of speech
*  on our platform anymore, then everything is like out the window.
*  What is this?
*  What are we doing?
*  And then if it backfires and Twitter loses all of its power and some other fucking...
*  Company comes along and takes the spot, some company that promises to never do that to
*  the president, let people express themselves, but explain perhaps through a fucking series
*  of checks and balances why you can't stalk somebody or be mean to somebody or...
*  Does this make any sense or are we just really high?
*  Is it about him being on the most popular, like Twitter, then like the most popular platform?
*  Because he could do radio.
*  He could do anything he wants.
*  Yeah, and nobody's paying attention to the radio or the TV things that he does and everyone
*  pays attention to his tweets?
*  It's interesting because he's got to think.
*  He has...
*  I mean, he's a guy that obviously he does a lot of business deals and he does a lot
*  of deals simultaneously.
*  It's the only way he could have as many properties as he has.
*  He's got Trump Towers everywhere.
*  He's got them in Vegas and Chicago and all over the world.
*  He's got to be a guy that's always thinking about doing the next thing.
*  And if he was, you would think he's setting himself up as a business.
*  It's like he's a business.
*  He's now not just a president and he's always been a business.
*  He's always been a celebrity and an iconic financial character.
*  But now his entertainment, like what he says about life and everything is fucking super
*  valuable.
*  If Trump...
*  Like Trump had that show, if he decides to have a podcast, do you know how goddamn crazy
*  it would be?
*  If Donald Trump just pulls up, has a YouTube channel, talks into the camera, says what
*  he really thinks about everything, they release it as a podcast as well and no one can stop
*  him because that's freedom of speech.
*  His freedom of speech is let this guy talk.
*  Do you know if he started threatening people, like threatening Iran from his YouTube channel,
*  like what the fuck?
*  Imagine if World War III is caused by a tweet.
*  Imagine if Trump threatens someone and they retaliate to show they're not scared and we
*  nuke them and then, oh my God, from a Trump tweet.
*  Is that possible?
*  It seems like anything is possible.
*  He's probably going to do it right at the end too.
*  The end is a weird one, right?
*  Is it going to be a few months from now or is it going to be four years from now?
*  That's with all this Iran thing is it might happen faster.
*  I didn't think it was going to happen at all, but now maybe this Iran thing.
*  The impeachment thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe this is for a purpose.
*  He's not going to just go.
*  That's the thing.
*  There's a lot of people that don't want him to go.
*  The Republicans don't want to lose power.
*  They're very smart in that even ones that were never Trumpers at one point in time,
*  they've accepted him.
*  He's a fascinating guy.
*  He's a fascinating human character if you look at him in terms of just his ... Go back
*  to that photo that we're just looking at.
*  Let me see that in big time.
*  He's a fascinating character, man.
*  He's also a very strong guy in a lot of ways, mentally strong in terms of what he's been
*  able to accomplish, all the business deals, always believes in himself.
*  There's something about that that gets other people and they get a little ass kissy around
*  them and they want him to like them because if he doesn't like you, it's devastating.
*  If Trump goes after you on Twitter, he gets mad at you, it's devastating.
*  They all want him to like him.
*  Look at them all reaching for him.
*  That's a painting one day that they'll have on the caves.
*  They'll cave paint that after World War III, after we get nuked into the fucking Stone
*  Age.
*  They'll cave paint how a guy figured out how to be just mean enough but just nice enough
*  and have all these people like him and literally be able to kill someone with the press of
*  a button.
*  Then everybody wants to touch him.
*  Look at that.
*  They're reaching.
*  Look at the guy in the back.
*  They're all reaching.
*  It's like a Michelangelo painting.
*  Bro, it is.
*  And that this guy somehow got into this crazy position from hosting a reality show and getting
*  really famous by telling people they're fired.
*  And now all of a sudden, he's deciding whether or not they can nuke generals into another
*  dimension from a robot that flies and just shoots missiles.
*  And the missiles are called Hellfire missiles.
*  Did you hear that new, I think Russia has it, that super sound goes Mach 27.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  They drop it from space and it just like roller coasters itself in and I guess we don't have
*  a thing to stop it yet.
*  It's 27 times the speed of sound.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  This is the Space Force shit.
*  This is why Trump wanted to have a Space Force.
*  When I heard about a Space Force, I was like, what are you doing, man?
*  Space Force.
*  But here's the other thing.
*  When you're 74, whatever he is, do you realize you're 74 or are you just alive?
*  I think you're just alive, especially if you're on diet pills.
*  Then I think you're really just alive.
*  You're out there.
*  You're just fucking grinding.
*  You're just like grinding because that's how you do it.
*  You just go out there and you kick ass.
*  He's not thinking about riding off into the sunset.
*  He's not thinking about any of that shit.
*  But people, we think that way.
*  When we see someone who's 74, we're like, oh, by the time he's 78, he's going to want
*  out.
*  He's not going to want out.
*  He's not going to want out.
*  He's alive.
*  Is he alive?
*  Yeah, he's going to keep going.
*  Especially if you're stimulated, if you're artificially stimulated.
*  You know, I mean, I'm talking right now while I'm drinking coffee.
*  That's why I'm so excited.
*  Is he tick tocking yet?
*  I hope he does.
*  I hope that'd be great.
*  I tick tock.
*  My first tick tock was three, almost three million in 24 hours.
*  Jamie says they fuck with the numbers.
*  Yeah, they said they have to.
*  Right.
*  But my comments were like in the thousands, though.
*  But maybe those are all robots, spam robots.
*  Well, they're obviously working overtime to try to get it big.
*  And a lot of people are jumping on board.
*  Kevin Hart just got on board.
*  That is a big, that's a big acquisition.
*  I can't do it, man.
*  And the Rock, the Rock got on board.
*  That's another big acquisition.
*  I took all my social media and I put it in a folder that says addict.
*  I put it on my last page, my iPhone, and I got a smaller iPhone.
*  Oh, you did?
*  Which one did you get?
*  The littler one.
*  Oh, you got that.
*  Yeah, that one's better.
*  The regular one.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that TikTok groups are taking over the YouTubers of Hollywood and moving into
*  mansions and like.
*  Imagine.
*  Whatever they're, I don't know.
*  I don't know how that works.
*  Imagine.
*  How are they making all this money?
*  I don't understand it.
*  But imagine a TikTok president.
*  This is our first TikTok president.
*  Maybe it could be you, dude.
*  What?
*  No.
*  Yeah, could be.
*  What if it was the whole.
*  We could make that happen, I think.
*  What if it was the whole staff of Shark Tank?
*  That would be a good idea.
*  Like they would be the presidents?
*  Yeah, but they all work together as.
*  Not a bad idea, right?
*  I think a bunch of successful, reasonable people.
*  And I don't mean successful financially even.
*  Just you know, like scholars.
*  Maybe business people and scholars mixed together.
*  Like that would be the right way to run the country.
*  Like a committee where you could see the way they interact with each other in real time
*  so everybody would have access to all the communication.
*  Unless it's anything to do with like national security.
*  You know, I mean, obviously they can't let everybody know that they're going to bomb
*  that guy in Iran.
*  They can't do that.
*  But it would be really interesting if like policy issues, economic issues, if all those
*  things were discussed publicly.
*  Like if you saw these guys, like if you saw the guy who is one of the ten people who is
*  the president, right?
*  And you saw them all present evidence and they all go over the work and they look at
*  it.
*  This is what's projected.
*  If we don't cut carbon emissions, this is what we know.
*  And this is the hyperbole.
*  This is the click bait that you hear.
*  This is the reality of it.
*  And this is where we're at now.
*  And here's our possible solutions.
*  And we'd all just sit around and they could look at the budget even.
*  Say, okay, we're going to put X amount of billion to this and Y amount of billion to
*  that and then we're going to put, you know, a significant amount.
*  And we can go, well, why are they doing it that way?
*  Like everything else, right?
*  The internet has allowed people to communicate and bitch and piss and moan about everything
*  else.
*  But not really on the, the inner works of government.
*  They're still doing it in like these rooms.
*  They're still doing it tucked away.
*  You can watch some of it on CNN, but some of it you don't get to see.
*  It's all tucked away.
*  National security, national interests, secrecy.
*  So I mean, you give people the option to have stuff like that, like gigantic worldwide decisions
*  that are made by a handful of people.
*  That is kind of crazy.
*  It's kind of crazy that someone, whether it's Trump or anybody, could make that decision.
*  Like this might throw us into nuclear war, but we're going to let these motherfuckers
*  know what's up.
*  Let's take a rocket and kill that fucking guy.
*  You want to do it?
*  Let's do it.
*  Let's fucking kill that guy.
*  The fact that you can do that, the fact that you, how many people do you think were involved
*  in the decision to kill that Iranian guy?
*  I read that it was, there was some sort of like PowerPoint presentation given to Trump
*  and it was the last slide was like, this is our option.
*  Another option is doing this.
*  And they like unexpectedly he picked that.
*  Yeah.
*  There was like, he picked the craziest one, like the killing.
*  I don't know what different levels.
*  I'll take the Adderall option for 10, Alex.
*  Wow.
*  See, that's what's crazy.
*  So that's one person.
*  That's even more crazy.
*  Like one person gets to make that call.
*  Like we always thought there was like so many checks and balances.
*  Like don't, this is what I kept hearing from reasonable people like Brian Callan.
*  He won't be able to get anything done once he gets in there.
*  It's just like, there's so many systems and checks and balances.
*  And this is the reason why the founding fathers were so smart in the way they set up the constitution
*  and set up our government.
*  Well, if he can fucking start World War III, if he can do that and that starts World War
*  III, yeah, they missed that part.
*  Yeah.
*  You fucked up.
*  You missed the Twitter part too.
*  Twitter part.
*  They're going to have to change that right after him, right?
*  Oh, and we're adding no Twitter.
*  No Twitter.
*  Mild TikTok.
*  You saw this crazy.
*  I feel like this is in some way related.
*  Yeah, Kevin Spacey.
*  Yeah, this crazy video he put on his YouTube channel.
*  Yeah.
*  He keeps doing that character.
*  People keep on dying.
*  Bro.
*  That's a little creepy too.
*  This came out.
*  Right, but how did the guy die?
*  Suicide?
*  Was it suicide?
*  Suicided?
*  Do you see the list of how many people have died?
*  Suicide?
*  What, that were involved with Kevin Spacey?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God, is there a lot?
*  Yeah, there's like three or four or something like that.
*  All the disaccusers, I think.
*  Imagine if it's the actor from House of Cards, the actor that was his assistant that killed
*  people for him.
*  Imagine if that actor.
*  Yes.
*  Imagine if Doug, the guy is so deep into his character that he goes out and whacks all,
*  because it was the best role he ever got.
*  I could see that.
*  Do you think Kevin Spacey would get pissed if we play this?
*  I would maybe.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Just like Maxwell's going to show up in his next one, I feel like.
*  Right.
*  Just like they're hanging out somewhere.
*  But it's so strange that he's doing it like this.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I mean, this is a character.
*  Look, he's rustling the fire.
*  I know what you're thinking.
*  I'm dead serious.
*  I'm dead serious.
*  And it's not that hard, trust me.
*  The next time someone does something you don't like, you can go on the attack, but you can
*  also hold your fire and do the unexpected.
*  You can kill them with kindness.
*  What the fuck?
*  What is this?
*  And then the guy commits suicide.
*  Bro, what is this world?
*  Imagine if he threatens everybody and starts getting jobs again.
*  People are like, I don't know how he's doing it, but everybody's dying.
*  Let's just hire him, man.
*  House of Cards will be fucking huge.
*  Just hear me out.
*  Season nine.
*  We never showed that he was dead.
*  We never showed that he was dead.
*  The last season when they had no him, I was like, what are you doing?
*  OK, what the fuck are you doing?
*  What are you doing here?
*  What would you do to my show?
*  This ain't my show.
*  This is like, oh, my God, everybody's watching us.
*  That's what the show was now.
*  Oh, my God, everybody's watching everything we do.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Now what do we do?
*  That show seems so, like, nervous, didn't it?
*  The first episode, it was like they didn't have like a regular House of Cards episode.
*  It was like everything was like a little bit barely glued together.
*  It's like, I try to figure out how to say how he was gone or whatever to write.
*  I wonder if they were reluctant.
*  I wonder if they're like, excuse me, I don't know how many people will watch.
*  I apologize.
*  They didn't have to refilm like they did that other movie.
*  They didn't even start yet.
*  Right. Do you remember?
*  Because there was a movie they made where they had to go back and shoot with somebody
*  else that he was in.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  It was done.
*  They never reshoot it.
*  He was great in Baby Driver.
*  He's a great actor, man.
*  He's just a crazy fuck that grabs dicks.
*  The one guy that died though, one of the reasons why, I mean, I'm not really that.
*  I don't think that this would warrant a murder.
*  All they did was they were hanging out and he said Kevin Spacey reached out and grabbed
*  his junk and said, let's go get some air.
*  And he got mad and said, no, what the fuck?
*  But do you think someone, I mean, would that be a reason why Kevin Spacey would kill you
*  for saying that?
*  I mean, how many people is he going to kill?
*  Do you think he killed people?
*  What do you think?
*  I want to know your honest opinion.
*  What if he always killed people?
*  Kevin Spacey settles assault lawsuit following death of accuser.
*  It was one week after that video was posted.
*  Whoa.
*  He settled it.
*  Now there's, I think Sam Tripley or somebody posted like a list of all the people and there
*  was like four or five people.
*  Tripley might have added.
*  One was, Tripley loves it.
*  Tripley is in his glory.
*  And but look, this is a real, all this shit that's happening is a real, it's a good time
*  to be a conspiracy theorist.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Cause there's a few of them that aren't ridiculous.
*  There's some juicy ones right now.
*  Like fuck this Jack Ruby shit.
*  Let that one go.
*  We don't know folks.
*  We're never going to know.
*  But I'll tell you what, we got one in front of us right now that rivals that.
*  We got quite a few of them.
*  And how about that?
*  The first British astronaut, the first, she's a woman, first woman in space, I think from
*  Britain too.
*  I think I might be wrong about that.
*  But she was talking about aliens, that aliens definitely exist.
*  They're definitely out there.
*  Astronauts.
*  Aliens definitely exist and they could be living among us on earth says Britain's first
*  astronaut.
*  Powerful Britain, first astronauts to check.
*  All those dudes over there just must've been too polite.
*  Let her get the gig.
*  Wow.
*  She, uh.
*  Good for her.
*  That's a bad ass move to be the first astronaut who's a woman from a country.
*  Like that bitch runs shit.
*  Right?
*  You gotta be powerful.
*  Cause think about how many British dudes are in like space force, whatever the fuck they
*  have over there.
*  What do they have?
*  They have the SS people.
*  Like what?
*  No, it's not SS.
*  That's the Nazis.
*  What do they have?
*  They have.
*  MI6?
*  But they have an S something.
*  Oh, oh.
*  What do they have?
*  Like, uh, what's their version of like the CIA?
*  Well now I'm thinking James Bond.
*  That's the MI6 I think.
*  But I think there's a thing.
*  MI5?
*  They have something.
*  Secret service?
*  SIS?
*  That's what it is.
*  SIS.
*  That's what it is.
*  I'm saying SS.
*  I'm like no, they're not Nazis.
*  Don't.
*  Fuck, you're ruining it again.
*  Well it's the same thing as MI6.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, think about all those people that they must have had in their Air Force.
*  All the men.
*  And then a woman gets to be the first person in space.
*  That's pretty badass.
*  Or somebody wanted a woman to be the first person in space and they made sure.
*  That's possible.
*  I don't know though.
*  But if it's the former, I like to think positive.
*  I like to think she kicked everybody's ass.
*  Became the first woman in space.
*  That's gotta be a trippy.
*  Trippy fucking thing.
*  First person from a nation to be launched into the gases above our head and to see the
*  blackness.
*  The blackness of no atmosphere.
*  She was just the first British woman, right?
*  Mmhmm.
*  I was thinking the first British person.
*  That's what it said, right?
*  I was always more of that challenger chick.
*  Oh, the teacher, man.
*  I remember that.
*  I remember watching that at a girlfriend's house.
*  Good hair.
*  I went to visit her.
*  She lived in western Massachusetts.
*  Had to drive all the way out there.
*  I think it was a couple hours.
*  In the morning, I watched it on television after the fact.
*  I wasn't awake when it actually happened.
*  I watched it after I woke up.
*  I remember seeing that thing blow up.
*  We watched it with our whole fifth grade class.
*  Our whole school when I was in fifth grade.
*  Is that her?
*  Sally Ride.
*  That's the woman?
*  Yep.
*  But that's not the school teacher.
*  That's not the girl from Challenger, right?
*  She died.
*  She's an astronaut.
*  The girl who was a school teacher.
*  There was a woman who they brought on board who was just a school teacher.
*  That was the big...
*  It's a weird thing, right?
*  It's like, it's okay if certain people die, but a school teacher dying made it way worse.
*  Yeah, she had more of a perm.
*  How do you say that?
*  Christa McAuliffe?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When that lady died, everybody was like, oh man.
*  But if it was like all astronauts, just like all dudes who wear aviators, mirrored sunglasses,
*  or hard ass fucking chiseled faces, we'd feel bad, but we wouldn't feel as bad.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  I felt bad.
*  That was like our first 9-11, I think, when that happened.
*  It was a minor 9-11 in terms of the amount of death, but in terms of the shock that it
*  had on our system.
*  Yeah, because I think we all thought that we were going to space and that this was like
*  space 1999 was going to turn out to be right.
*  Because that was...
*  What is that?
*  I graduated in Newton South class of 85.
*  So that was the year after that.
*  That was 86.
*  Bro.
*  Yeah, we thought we were all going to be in space.
*  We thought that they retired the Apollo program and they just started doing the shuttles and
*  really they're just ramping up the infrastructure of space and eventually we're going to be
*  living on the moon.
*  I remember when they said they were retiring the Challengers and all the shuttles a couple
*  years ago.
*  I was like, what?
*  No!
*  I wouldn't...
*  That was sad.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Elon Musk has got some crazy fucking spaceship he's trying to shoot people in
*  the atmosphere with.
*  He's going to be in charge of Space Force.
*  That's the guy.
*  He's going to be in charge of everything, man.
*  But it's interesting.
*  You know, he was...
*  People forget he was a part of something in the Trump administration when it first happened.
*  When Trump first got in office and he left when Trump backed out of the Paris Accord,
*  the climate Accord.
*  That was the case, right?
*  Yeah, there's like a group of business people that I think they all left together or something.
*  Yeah.
*  That's...
*  One guy has a lot of power, man.
*  Updated news on another story?
*  Harvey Weinstein indicted on new sex crimes in Los Angeles.
*  He just went on trial today in New York on his other charges.
*  Your charges just dropped in an hour ago.
*  Jesus.
*  What kind of sex crimes?
*  Sexual assault charges.
*  One woman sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013.
*  They've allegedly raped a woman.
*  So...
*  Okay, so he still has charges against him.
*  I thought for some reason all his charges have been...
*  Oh no, he's on trial in New York and this is a separate thing here in LA.
*  You know what they should do with him?
*  They should get him...
*  They said, listen, we're willing to be more lenient on you, but we want to get you in
*  a room just clad in a jumpsuit and we're going to give you a high dose of MDMA.
*  And we're just going to talk to you, Harvey, about how you feel about people and why you
*  lash out and how did this all get started?
*  What's true and what's not true?
*  What did you do to people?
*  And what did people willingly do?
*  And is that the same thing?
*  That's where it gets weird.
*  It's like sex as a transaction is one of the...
*  It's one of the weirder things about people is that you can do that.
*  It's almost like everyone's a drug dealer.
*  If someone wants to fuck you, the drug is sex, that feeling of sex.
*  People love it.
*  They love it.
*  Everybody loves it.
*  So if someone knew that other people love it and they can get something to let those
*  other people do it, and we go, no, you can't.
*  You can't.
*  Why can't you?
*  But you're doing it anyway just by virtue of your looks.
*  If you're just trying to be successful on being good looking in a lot of ways, it's
*  like the entry level of that game.
*  You're looking good so that people give you things.
*  You're looking good so that people pay you if you want to be like a professional hot
*  chick or a model.
*  You're looking good and then people pay you because you're looking good.
*  And we're all like, we have no problem with that.
*  Everyone feels no problem with that.
*  But if you go and do that and then use your body, say, I like looking good because I can
*  get things, but if I use my body, I get more things.
*  So I've been using my body.
*  You can't use your body.
*  You can't.
*  What is that?
*  We can't imagine if gold diggers, it was encouraged and guys liked it too.
*  And they're like a bunch of old dudes that didn't care.
*  And it was all free on the Internet.
*  Everybody would give out information.
*  You just, I'll take care of your rent.
*  Come over here and suck this, Johnson.
*  If you just made deals, transactional deals, keep it clean.
*  That's pretty much what girls do.
*  But you can't do it legally.
*  My point is like, there's so many lazy girls out there that don't want to take a job.
*  If they can get $2,000 by blowing some old dude, they'd be in on that.
*  And a heartbeat.
*  Nothing wrong with that though.
*  That's my position.
*  Nothing wrong with that.
*  Do you think we'll see that legal soon?
*  Like that should be something soon.
*  No, nobody wants their daughter to be a whore.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  But it's one of those things, it's a hypocritical even, of course, it should be legal.
*  Everything should be legal.
*  Of course you don't want your daughter to be a hooker.
*  But of course everything should be legal that doesn't, see, if it's illegal, people are still
*  going to want it.
*  So if they're going to want it, then you're going to get it where it's illegal.
*  And you're going to get criminals, people that can go to jail.
*  They're going to be the ones that are providing these girls with protection.
*  They're going to be the ones that also dictate how much money the girls make and how much
*  money they take.
*  And we all know what happens there.
*  I mean, that's Pimp 101.
*  We've all seen pimps outpost down, right?
*  And the other one, American Pimp, is that the other one?
*  That was a great one too.
*  If it was legal, these girls would be protected.
*  They'd probably have the exact same amount of people that were paying for it.
*  Actually, more would pay for it for sure.
*  If it became legal, what am I talking about?
*  That spot next to the Comedy Store used to be a brothel.
*  Imagine if it still was.
*  What, Katana?
*  Yeah.
*  Katana was a brothel?
*  You have to watch that Sunset Ship documentary.
*  No.
*  Maybe back in the 30s, probably.
*  It was a while ago.
*  That's why it's so beautiful.
*  It's a beautiful place.
*  Right, smells good.
*  Imagine what it was like back then.
*  People just, like Bugsy Siegel.
*  They owned the Comedy Store.
*  You know?
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  That was Bugsy Siegel's place.
*  Can you imagine?
*  People just got whacked back then.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  No, everyone had a shovel in their trunk.
*  The old photos of the stars and stuff that would go to that are just insane.
*  Insane.
*  Yeah, and that weird peep thing where you can look down from the green room and see
*  onto the stage.
*  Yeah.
*  So strange.
*  The fact that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were looking through there.
*  Fucking mob, man.
*  The government is kind of a mob.
*  I mean, it's an elected mob.
*  But it's kind of a mob.
*  You know?
*  Especially when you see people like Julian Assange.
*  Where you're like, wait, wait, wait.
*  What are you doing to him?
*  Why are you doing that to him?
*  What did he do?
*  Exactly?
*  What happened there?
*  He apparently got hacked.
*  Like a lot of people said that he put out unredacted names.
*  Apparently what I heard or what I read was that that wasn't the case.
*  That he put out the stuff with redacted names, but someone got to hold the original copy of it.
*  And they released it.
*  Mexican president calls for Julian Assange's freedom.
*  Oh shit, it's going down.
*  Trump wants to talk some shit.
*  Julian Assange in Mexico with Pamela Anderson on the beach doing YouTube.
*  I called it.
*  I called it now.
*  Slow-mo run.
*  Dude, together, holding hands, talking about the future.
*  Greta Thornberg adopts them.
*  What?
*  Let them out.
*  Bring them to fucking Punta Mita, bro.
*  Puerto Vallarta.
*  Do you ever travel to Mexico?
*  I love Mexico.
*  What's your favorite part?
*  Puerto Vallarta.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it there.
*  The other part that I think is the most fucking dope is Chichen Itza.
*  That's the Mayan ruins in the Yucatan.
*  Fuck, man.
*  That was one where I was walking around and going, who?
*  How?
*  What were you guys like?
*  You guys built giant, huge stone structures that mimic the cosmos.
*  You had specific rooms that were designed for LSD use.
*  I think some, at least according to my guide, he was saying that they had some plant that had lysergic acid in it.
*  There's a bunch of different plants.
*  What do they get them from?
*  Morning glory seeds.
*  Morning glory seeds apparently you can get acid from.
*  And they would take whatever this, they don't know exactly what the substance was.
*  They would trip balls.
*  But he showed me all these different places where they did like human sacrifice,
*  where they had this game.
*  And the game, what was really crazy was he was, that's the human sacrifice spot.
*  They would put people right on that spot and cut their fucking heart out.
*  Hala.
*  Hala.
*  And look at the dude, the dude's face that you would kill someone on.
*  Like, it's so creepy.
*  Imagine they're pulling you over there and laying you down on that fucking thing to cut your heart out.
*  Fuck, no.
*  That was a weird thing that people used to like to do.
*  Human sacrifice.
*  You know, like, do you know about the Mexican pyramid?
*  The Aztec pyramid of, I think you say Teotocan.
*  Do you know how to say that?
*  Teotocan.
*  See if we can get an audio so we can listen to how you're pronouncing that word.
*  But that temple, when they built it, afterwards they slaughtered all of the slaves.
*  How do you say that?
*  Here we go.
*  Talk to a professor.
*  How to pronounce.
*  Here we go.
*  Give me.
*  Teotocan.
*  Damn, what a dope language.
*  What a dope language.
*  Teotocan.
*  Teotocan.
*  People just like, when they believed in magic, they had cooler ways of describing things.
*  Teotocan.
*  Does it mean, how are you like, stop and look at that word.
*  How are you living 10,000 years ago, barely scraping by, and you have the time to come up with that many words?
*  Like that many sounds for one word.
*  Teotocan.
*  You know, what's your name?
*  Jamie Vernon.
*  Super simple.
*  Comes off the tongue.
*  Zero problems.
*  Same amount of sounds.
*  Where do you live?
*  Ohio.
*  Teotocan.
*  Why is it so big?
*  Same amount of letters too.
*  Yeah.
*  Eleven letters.
*  Is what?
*  Is my name?
*  Yeah, altogether.
*  Same amount of syllables.
*  But I need a space.
*  All right.
*  I need a space.
*  Whenever they get, words are too long, right?
*  It's like run on sentences.
*  Hey, I need you to pause.
*  It's probably three words.
*  It should be.
*  Make it three words and I'll remember it.
*  It probably was.
*  Somebody put it together.
*  Doesn't that seem simple?
*  Make it three words and I'll remember it.
*  Make it one big ass stupid word with a bunch of weird silent letters.
*  I don't know what the fuck you're doing here.
*  Teotocan?
*  Okay.
*  You know, there's a bunch of them words.
*  You know, Yoni and Jacek?
*  Tony Henshkos, favorite fighter.
*  Former UFC strawweight champion, beast of a woman.
*  Her name, try pronouncing that shit.
*  There's a J and then a Z.
*  And it starts, when you say it, it starts with a Y.
*  Yeah, you say like her last name, it sounds like there's an N.
*  There's no N in there.
*  Yeah, where is it?
*  Yeah, where is it?
*  Yoni Jacek?
*  How do you spell it?
*  I could not spell it if you put a gun to my head.
*  J-E-D-R-Z-E-J-C-Z-Y-K.
*  What is that?
*  It's a lot.
*  And the way you say it is Yoni Jacek.
*  I hope I'm not fucking that up.
*  I'm doing my best.
*  Yoni Jacek.
*  I don't know the actual letter of that second E.
*  Joanna Yoni Jacek.
*  It's a horse.
*  J-O and E with a dick.
*  That's a transient.
*  Oh!
*  Look at that E.
*  It's got a little hanger.
*  Little hanger.
*  How come they don't have the hanger in the large font?
*  Probably too...
*  Somebody fucked up.
*  Formatting it.
*  Editor slipped up over at Wikipedia.
*  Wow.
*  So what do you think that trans E means?
*  I'll Google it.
*  Is it a J?
*  It doesn't seem anything like Yoni Jacek.
*  That's weird when other countries use the same letters as we do, but they don't agree on the sound.
*  That's like, oh, well, we're just in crazy town now.
*  It's a nasal E.
*  E with a little tail.
*  Mmm.
*  E.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm Yoni Jacek.
*  An E with a little tail.
*  Huh.
*  Nasal E.
*  Too complicated, you fucks.
*  It's like that chick from My Cousin Vinny.
*  What's her name?
*  Eee.
*  Marissa Tomei.
*  Eee.
*  Marissa Tomei.
*  Eee.
*  Eee.
*  Eee.
*  So there was one other thing that we wanted to talk about when we first started.
*  One of them was the Jeffrey Epstein.
*  Do you remember what the other one was?
*  You were going to show me the Jeffrey Epstein.
*  I'm such a child.
*  There's the Jervais thing and then George Lopez's comment.
*  Oh, that's it.
*  That's it.
*  So and then there's a bounty on Trump's head.
*  I guess.
*  I don't know how anyone heard it or where they listed it, but I read it on Twitter and
*  then people were making jokes about it.
*  How much is the bounty?
*  80 million from somewhere in Iran or I don't know.
*  If you go to Bet DSI, you can get one.
*  Dude, imagine if they nuke Trump.
*  Where does the world stand if they only drop one nuke and it's on the White House?
*  Small one, little baby nuke.
*  Just levels the entire building and everything near it.
*  Iran dropped out of their nuclear accord, so they're going to start enriching uranium
*  again.
*  Also tweeted, Iran does not have any nuclear weapons.
*  Explanation point hashtag something.
*  Right, but they can get them.
*  This is so crazy.
*  This seems like for the first time in a long time, I'm thinking we could go to war with
*  a country.
*  But this seems crazy.
*  The Internet jumped into World War Three memes immediately.
*  24 hours of straight jokes.
*  What do you think happens?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't even know what's happening right now.
*  It could be good stuff could be happening right now.
*  What did the guy do?
*  Because Dan Crenshaw was saying that he organized the attack on the embassy and then he was
*  organizing other attacks on US sites.
*  He was a bad guy.
*  Supposedly he like there was there is some stuff saying like he is a bad guy.
*  It's just how Trump did it is how the problem.
*  He did help fight ISIS a lot also.
*  So he wasn't he was a really bad guy.
*  But there was points like he the biggest problem is that Trump just went out and pretty much
*  assassinated him.
*  You know, like instead of dealing with it like an adult.
*  Do you imagine when they went through all those other like really finely detailed points,
*  this is a strategy we can employ or we just take them out with a missile.
*  Did he already was trolling Trump to like trolling him on Twitter.
*  I don't know if that was true.
*  That guy.
*  I was like, oh my God.
*  Could you imagine if that guy was trolling Trump and Trump killed him?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, my God.
*  He was talking about his hands or something.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Imagine.
*  Imagine you talking about his orange skin, his fake hair, his fucking baby hands.
*  He's like, oh, yeah, fucking baby hands.
*  Oh my God.
*  He got into a meme battle with Trump.
*  I might have Googled it too quick.
*  It could be a fake site.
*  I don't think it is.
*  The Daily Dot.
*  Is that a fake site?
*  Maybe it was too quick.
*  I don't know.
*  The Daily Dot.
*  Is that a real website?
*  I'm trying to confirm.
*  Okay.
*  Does this other site, does other things look real?
*  Keep us posted.
*  Okay.
*  I don't want to comment just yet because I have a feeling I have a lot to say about this.
*  I want to see what the memes are.
*  It's so crazy, man.
*  It's so crazy that this fucking, this situation that we find ourselves in, when none of us
*  who are listening to this had anything to do with any of this shit that might kill a
*  million people.
*  None of us.
*  None of us.
*  And then our leaders, like that we've been so roped in this fucking Game of Thrones mentality
*  that our leaders are going to make these critical decisions for us and they're going to be in
*  charge of whether, what kind of diplomacy we employ on other nations.
*  They're going to represent us in the most personal way possible.
*  Like the way he does it, like the way Trump does it, that's personal.
*  That's how he is.
*  So he's standing for us, but he's standing up for himself as a person.
*  There's part of that too, right?
*  Like he doesn't want to be fucked with.
*  He wants you to know the United States is not going to be fucked with with me in charge.
*  They're like, yeah.
*  So it's like him.
*  He's the one out there and he's the one they go, you can, you can just nuke the guy.
*  He's like, well, fuck, I'll, I'll just nuke them.
*  Commander of the Islamic revolution guards, corpse, uh, force major general.
*  How do you say his name?
*  Soleimani.
*  Qasim?
*  Qasim?
*  I don't know if it's the first, Soleimani I think.
*  Soleimani responded to the U.S. president Donald Trump's announcement of sanctions are
*  coming with a game of thrones inspired meme of his own.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  And it says, I will stand against you.
*  And it has the game of thrones like, oh, and you.
*  So he put that up and then Trump.
*  Yeah, this is a couple of months ago, but I think.
*  He remembers.
*  This is November, uh, 2018.
*  I think it was a year ago.
*  Bro, he's got that speed memory.
*  Trump, Trump can remember shit.
*  This motherfucker owes me since the seventies.
*  That's crazy.
*  That is crazy.
*  A guy memes you and then you murder him.
*  Whoa.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Baked Alaska better hide.
*  And it was a game of thrones thing.
*  So crazy.
*  It's so crazy that these worlds have collided.
*  And then what do you think?
*  Putin is probably laughing his ass off right now.
*  He's probably got his feet up on the chair, smoking a cigar, just laughing and laughing,
*  watching this chaos play out.
*  And then for sure he's going to help Iran for sure.
*  Anything to destabilize is his number one competitor.
*  That's what China is going to do too.
*  This is so dumb.
*  It's also scary, but it's also one of those things where we don't know what the fuck is
*  going on.
*  So it could have been the right move.
*  We don't know.
*  It might have been the thing you have to do to avoid more deaths.
*  China, Russia and Iran hold joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman.
*  Oh, terrific.
*  That's great.
*  China, Russia and Iran together.
*  We're getting to some World War Three shit here.
*  That's World War Three.
*  That is like when Italy was joined in Germany.
*  That's what that is.
*  We should probably get away from the coast.
*  Bro.
*  Imagine.
*  Imagine if this fucking guy gets us into World War Three by deciding to do that and then
*  have all these crazy threats.
*  See, the rest of the world does not want to think.
*  This is one of the things like if you think you're the baddest motherfucker and you represent
*  the baddest country, you got to kind of almost be like a real baddest motherfucker.
*  Like a guy like Stipe Miocic, like a UFC heavyweight champ.
*  They don't go around saying they're going to kick everybody's ass because everybody
*  already knows it.
*  And if you start saying that you're going to be able to do whatever you want and maybe
*  even do it in a disproportionate manner, all the other countries like why do you have any
*  power?
*  Like who are you, man?
*  And they say like we're really powerful.
*  We all get together, bitch.
*  You're pretending you're more powerful than everybody.
*  That's a weird thing to do.
*  It's a weird chest puffing strategy to take on a country that has allies.
*  That's where it gets fucked up.
*  It's not just Iran.
*  Iran.
*  It's all Iran's allies.
*  They all get together.
*  Now you have a giant force of people and nuclear weapons.
*  Congratulations.
*  Did you guys play chess or did you play checkers growing up?
*  How the fuck are you just a tic-tac-toe ace and you didn't see this coming?
*  This is why it's really important to have, you know, people have to be able to talk,
*  be able to have dialogue.
*  You see this tweet that he said before?
*  Yes.
*  Targeted 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago.
*  Bro, that was during the Carter administration.
*  I think we can let that go.
*  These are not the same fucking people.
*  Those people are all dead.
*  That's crazy.
*  So this is more team mentality.
*  But that'll get the yokels.
*  All the fucking yeah.
*  All the dudes just jump off the tractor jacking off into the fields and they hear that.
*  Like yeah, fucking get them Trump.
*  This shit could get hot.
*  This could get hot and it could get real.
*  And if he really has the ability to do that, what other causes he have the ability to do?
*  Is there ever going to be another moment like that where Iran boxes in a ship and then he
*  sends in a fighter jet?
*  I mean, is this going to really fucking happen?
*  Because then none of us can go anywhere.
*  We have to hide and we got to get out of LA because it definitely going to nuke that.
*  This is because imagine the movie if it all played out like that in like a Stephen King
*  movie made a thing about a game show host that eventually becomes the president of the
*  United States and starts a war while he's on speed.
*  I do that every day.
*  I'm really high.
*  Well now I'm getting there.
*  I was not getting there before.
*  This was enough to make me go, holy shit.
*  Is there a better way to handle that than blasting that guy with a robot from the sky?
*  Like where did we start?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I don't want to know.
*  You don't want to know that all over the world these little pieces are in motion.
*  They're trying to protect us from terrorists, trying to make sure that they stop ISIS and
*  this sect is growing here and these people getting shot there.
*  And what about the cartels?
*  They're getting up this much.
*  If you will be paralyzed by fear.
*  If you took in all the information on all the fucking danger all over the world, you'd
*  be paralyzed by fear.
*  So when I was in Vegas while this was happening this weekend, if you didn't look at your phone,
*  you wouldn't have known any of this was going on.
*  I didn't hear anybody talking about it.
*  Yeah, I didn't either.
*  I walked all around.
*  That was the good thing about being off social media.
*  And this was my point in the first place.
*  By the time things get to me, it's already been sort of distributed better.
*  You know, I'll have to jump on right away and it becomes the focus of my day long before
*  we know anything.
*  And I keep refreshing CNN every five minutes.
*  I'm scared.
*  Like legitimately.
*  This is like for the first time in a long time since like 9-11 where I'm legitimately
*  like, oh, oh, this is some real shit.
*  This could be really bad because if he says he's going to do something in a disproportionate
*  manner, he's threatening them.
*  He's calling their bluff.
*  Bro, this is so dangerous.
*  So dangerous because all they have to do is just nuke Hawaii.
*  Do something like that where the rest of the world would be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, what
*  are we going to do?
*  We're going to kill each other everywhere, everyone?
*  Because that's what could happen.
*  This like mutually assured destruction was always supposed to be the big impediment that
*  mutually assured destruction.
*  We knew that if we shot them, they shoot us, we'd all be dead.
*  That's what kept us from using bombs.
*  But who the fuck knows, man?
*  What if Iran just says, listen, if we just sneak a bomb in by the time it's detonated,
*  they won't even have a chance to respond.
*  The whole system will be fucked.
*  Their grid will be down.
*  All their entertainment will be down.
*  Everything will be down.
*  And then the rest of the world can figure out a way to unite together and take over
*  the power that the United States once enjoyed.
*  They were abusing that power.
*  They were the number one superpower in the world.
*  And they let their guy take diet pills and threaten everybody on Twitter.
*  I don't know if he takes diet pills.
*  He had them in his dresser.
*  But I don't even know if those are his.
*  I just want to say maybe it's just strong coffee.
*  Maybe some of these Jaco energy drinks.
*  What are they?
*  I don't know.
*  Jaco just dropped them off.
*  Dakota Meyer sent them.
*  He's a part of the company, I guess.
*  Jaco is an energy drink.
*  Want some?
*  I want to get really mad.
*  And right now, this is a good time for these, right?
*  Because we're talking about America.
*  Jaco is probably one of the most American men that's ever lived.
*  That's right.
*  Last movie used both blackface and retard.
*  Five calories.
*  The last.
*  It'll never be a major movie again, like Tropical Thunder.
*  Right?
*  Never.
*  Impossible.
*  No?
*  No.
*  Impossible.
*  That's funny.
*  When you were saying earlier that if they cut out OJ, can you imagine if they just
*  cut out OJ and put all the OJ pieces together and made one OJ?
*  Damn, this is good.
*  This shit's good.
*  No artificial colors, sweeteners or flavors.
*  Oh, that is good.
*  Sugar-free keto.
*  That's right, bitches.
*  So I've been on the carnivore diet.
*  I'll tell you about that.
*  Yeah, that's like a healthier keto, right?
*  Or a better way to do it.
*  I don't know.
*  It's just all meat.
*  Just everything's meat.
*  I'm not eating any grains.
*  And I'm not eating any carbs.
*  Nothing else.
*  I mean, I have like an olive.
*  I had a Bloody Mary.
*  This is the fucking olive.
*  So it's not the most strict.
*  Occasionally, I'll deviate.
*  I'm allowing myself two glasses of wine and most of the rest of the shit I'm just drinking
*  is the water or these kill cliffs, these CBD kill cliffs, these things other shit.
*  Carnivore is like keto, but you're allowed to have fruit or something like that.
*  You're just eating meat.
*  You're just eating meat, like mostly meat.
*  And because I eat a lot of wild game, I have to substitute it.
*  So I have to supplement it with fat.
*  I'm adding other fats to it because wild game, it does not have much fat.
*  And you can when I read about the people that did this in there was a there was a guy that
*  was with the Inuit.
*  He was an explorer in the Arctic.
*  And he was talking about how he lived like that for six months.
*  And then it was one of I saw the video somewhere online, but it's old black and white footage.
*  And that the key was getting a lot of fat.
*  They were just drinking water and eating meat and they were fine as long as they got a lot
*  of fat.
*  They would eat like whale blubber and polar bear blubber and they would eat all this blubber
*  to sort of supplement their their fat intake.
*  They say it was very healthy eating like that.
*  I'm just doing it as an experiment.
*  You find the guy?
*  Oh, look at that.
*  Probably.
*  I would imagine this is probably a truth about the Inuit diet.
*  Maybe not.
*  They didn't need any vegetables, man.
*  It's not.
*  All right.
*  Never mind.
*  Oh, it's a long one, too.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, those people didn't need any vegetables.
*  I'm just curious.
*  I'm just giving it a shot.
*  There's they call it World Carnivore Month.
*  So I said, OK, let me see what Jordan Peterson is the main reason I want to try it, because
*  I really respect his thought process and I really respect his mind.
*  And when he started talking about all the different medical benefits that he had from
*  that he had autoimmune diseases that went away and I'm like, hmm, what is this?
*  And I know a bunch of people personally have tried it, too.
*  Is this a gentleman?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  That's him.
*  Yeah.
*  So he lived up with the Antarctic.
*  What's interesting is he said that they didn't eat the organ meat.
*  They gave the organ meat to the dogs.
*  I thought that was really weird because that's definitely been proven to be the yeah, that's
*  the guy right there.
*  Give me some volume on this dude.
*  Can we do that?
*  Can we do that?
*  Or will they get us in trouble?
*  I don't know.
*  This is very old.
*  I don't know if this is in the open domain.
*  Anyway, we'll just I'll just I'll just encapsulate what he said.
*  He just basically said that as long as they had the that's the guy, as long as they had
*  plenty of fat.
*  I'm just seeing what it feels like.
*  It's weird.
*  I'll tell you one thing.
*  I do not trust my butthole at all.
*  When I feel fart coming on, I'm like, oh, this could be a disaster.
*  I've had rocketing diarrhea from meat.
*  That's from all meat.
*  Yeah.
*  This is what Dr. Sean Baker, who's like one head carnivore proponents, is like his whole
*  life revolves around eating steak and deadlifting.
*  It's kind of hilarious.
*  And getting people to eat meat and try this carnivore diet.
*  And some of them have had some pretty radical health benefits.
*  And I'm so curious about that, because I know that sometimes people convince themselves
*  that something is better for them and that something's working better and they feel better.
*  And then there's a sort of a placebo effect that can happen when you join a community
*  of people that's also saying the same thing.
*  Like we're all getting better.
*  We're all feeling better.
*  So I was real hesitant when I first went into it.
*  I was like, oh, if I've I got I need to know there's there's something to this or this
*  is a nonsense way to eat because most of my thought process was this kind of a nonsense
*  way to eat.
*  You should eat some fiber.
*  But what's interesting is the the level of energy, your energy level.
*  It's like right here stays.
*  It doesn't go anywhere.
*  It doesn't go anywhere.
*  I mean, at the end of the day, I'm kind of tired.
*  And then I go to sleep.
*  That's weird, man, because how much of your energy levels during the day is based on your
*  body regulating sugar and insulin?
*  How much of it?
*  How much of your energy level is based on that?
*  Might be a lot.
*  Because this is the unquestionable difference of this diet.
*  Unquestionable difference is that my energy level basically has a flat line.
*  There's no roller coaster anymore.
*  And I had less of a roller coaster because I'm pretty healthy and I'm pretty strict with
*  what I eat, but not like this.
*  This is like this.
*  So for the last nine days or so, whatever the fuck it's been, I've had like an olive.
*  I had does your body go into ketosis at all?
*  I must. I'm not even checking.
*  It must. It must be in ketosis.
*  I mean, I'm eating a lot of fat.
*  I'm eating bacon with all these wild game dishes, everything I eat bacon with because
*  I need fat.
*  And I'm cooking everything in beef tallow.
*  Wow.
*  And then I'm getting like fatty meat too.
*  No butter or anything?
*  I'm using butter.
*  Yeah, you could drink milk.
*  I mean, the idea is like if you were a carnivore, you would take everything out of the body,
*  the milk, the fat, everything.
*  Look, man, it's weird.
*  I see why people would be opposed to it morally and ethically because you don't it would
*  require people to consume a lot more animals because if everybody was eating meat all the
*  time, the consumption, the need would go up and it'd be even more slaughter.
*  I get it.
*  It seems like you're going to get really bored quick.
*  That's very likely.
*  That's very likely that I get really bored quick.
*  But it's curious because if I think and I don't necessarily think this, I'm just saying
*  if I think this is the best way for me to eat, I'm not saying that I'm trying it.
*  And I'm basically trying it based on Mark Bell and Chris Bell and and even more Jordan,
*  because I've talked in depth with Jordan about it.
*  Jordan Peterson is a brilliant guy.
*  And when he was describing his experiences with this diet, I was like, what?
*  How many people have done this?
*  Right. How many modern, super intelligent, well-read, articulate people like Jordan
*  Peterson have done this diet?
*  I bet it's a really, really small amount because socially it's unappealing to even say
*  you're going to do it's sort of a taboo.
*  You're going to only meet.
*  Oh, you're going to eat all the meat.
*  You're not even going to eat any vegetables.
*  What are you, a baby?
*  That's vegetables are good for you.
*  Right.
*  That's what everybody immediately thinks.
*  I don't know if that's true, though.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  One of the things that Sean Baker said is that they were they're doing tests at Harvard
*  with with people who are on this diet for six months or more.
*  I don't know. I'm interested.
*  So I did some blood work today and I'll make that blood work public.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah. I mean, especially if there's anything wacky with it.
*  But then I'm going to do it again at the end of the month and I'll compare.
*  Wow. That's going to be a long month, I think, because I know with keto, I got so bored.
*  My kids are bored.
*  We're not eating steak again.
*  You don't have to eat steak. I have to eat steak.
*  You can eat whatever you want.
*  We'll figure this out.
*  We'll work it out.
*  How many ounces of meat a day?
*  Do you know what you're up to?
*  Well, for the good thing is I have a lot of elk.
*  That's good.
*  But I'm running through it.
*  You know, I'm eating some big ass chunks of meat.
*  Is there something that you go to a lot like chicken wings or something like that just because it's easy?
*  No.
*  Eggs.
*  You can eat eggs.
*  Eggs are easy.
*  Eggs are really easy to digest too.
*  Eggs just kind of go down.
*  Eggs are great.
*  You know, I wish that coyotes weren't real.
*  Those fucks.
*  You know, that's one of the things that James Wilkes from the Game Changers told me, where they were doing those regenerative farms, where they have these free ranging chickens.
*  And this is how we're going to get our eggs.
*  He told me they were losing like thousands and thousands of chickens to eagles.
*  He said it was so many.
*  I forget.
*  I wish I could remember what the number was.
*  I'll ask him.
*  But some insane amount of death was caused by the eagles realizing they could just get a chicken every day.
*  Just swoop in and get a chicken.
*  They're so easy.
*  They can't even fly.
*  And they're all in one.
*  There's one pendant area.
*  That'd be a great video.
*  I want to see that.
*  There's got to be a video of that.
*  Jamie.
*  Thank you.
*  Of course you are.
*  Do you subscribe to that Instagram Nature's Medal?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh yeah.
*  We promoted that.
*  That shit's scary.
*  The wolf with the dogs.
*  I try to tell everybody about that.
*  Yeah.
*  When the wolves killed the dogs.
*  Nature's Medal is one of the best accounts on the internet.
*  All you can eat buffet bald eagles prey on farmers chickens.
*  Apparently when eagles find out where your chickens are you're fucked man.
*  Because coyotes at least you can put up a fence.
*  You have dogs.
*  Two point two million.
*  Oh my God.
*  Farmer wins case.
*  Scroll up.
*  Case against after losing two point two million dollars worth of chickens to bald eagles.
*  Two point two million dollars in chickens.
*  One hundred sixty thousand chickens.
*  One hundred and sixty thousand chickens to eagles.
*  How crazy is that?
*  And eagles.
*  Eagles know you can't fuck with them.
*  That's the difference.
*  If a coyote eats your chicken you could shoot him in the dick.
*  Nobody cares.
*  Everybody wants you to shoot coyotes.
*  They'll go after your kids.
*  They'll kill your cat.
*  But eagles.
*  That's America bro.
*  You can't shoot an eagle.
*  Fuck your chickens.
*  Well maybe that's why maybe he might have.
*  I'm trying to figure out why he won a lawsuit but maybe it's because he couldn't protect them.
*  That's a complete guess though.
*  I'm trying to figure out what it's saying.
*  He's allowed to kill bald eagles.
*  Yeah because it protected bald eagles so he couldn't do anything about that I guess.
*  Now are bald eagles protected because they're very rare or is it because they're very rare and they're a United States bird.
*  Like you know they were trying to there's one thought at one point in time of making a puppy the United States bird.
*  Or the United States animal.
*  It was a pit bull I think.
*  Not a puppy.
*  It was a pit bull.
*  Yeah it was in the early the early days of the country.
*  I thought it was like recently.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  Least concern.
*  So they're protected but they're of least concern especially in some areas apparently in Alaska.
*  Brink of extinction in the late 20th century it says.
*  Uh huh.
*  That's what it is.
*  Brink of extirpation.
*  Extirpation.
*  Extirpation.
*  Yeah.
*  In the contiguous United States.
*  So that means Alaska.
*  So that means Alaska.
*  So we're the big amount of them.
*  Transferred to a list in 1995.
*  Transferred to a list of endangered species.
*  Was removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife in contiguous states on
*  June 28th 2007.
*  They're flying monsters.
*  That's our bird.
*  You see the one video of the eagle.
*  I think it was like a not a cow.
*  And they're just like rolling down the hill constantly.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Goats.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Goat.
*  Goat.
*  Yeah.
*  He pulls the goat off the rocks and bashes his brains in on the rocks on the way down.
*  He rides him down too.
*  He even got fucked up a little bit it looked like.
*  What is um.
*  What was the original.
*  Oh there's.
*  Look at that.
*  Goats probably like what the fuck is going on.
*  How crazy.
*  Do you know those aren't even heavy.
*  Those eagles are really light man.
*  Really?
*  Yeah they're like 10 pounds.
*  Oh that's the video.
*  They can kill a wolf.
*  They grab a sheep and fly with them.
*  That's probably not real.
*  Look how.
*  That is real dude.
*  It's real.
*  No that's a photoshop.
*  Come on make it real.
*  That's not real.
*  Eagles.
*  You think that's photoshop dude.
*  There's no way you can get that picture man.
*  The lust.
*  The lighting is so different.
*  There's white shit in there.
*  Come on just make it real.
*  Sorry.
*  Why can't that be real.
*  Come on.
*  If there was a GoPro that was that close to that.
*  That'd be the greatest video on the internet.
*  Oh that's a rat bitch.
*  I like the one where he's holding a fish or something.
*  Oh that's fake.
*  These.
*  Some of these look fake.
*  Yeah.
*  That one looks like a.
*  They're not bald.
*  The thing is the ones that it really looks like it's not really a bald eagle doing
*  that.
*  It's a golden eagle.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  People just having fun.
*  Yeah.
*  That eagle's carrying Andy Rock or Chris Rock.
*  What a crazy animal to have as our number one animal.
*  I mean it's such a emotionless ruthless beast.
*  Like a wolf would be so much better.
*  Wolves are cool.
*  Right.
*  They howl.
*  They look at you.
*  You can make a deal with them.
*  You know.
*  They make a deal with a wolf.
*  That's how wolves became dogs.
*  Humans made deals with them.
*  Right.
*  They're coming.
*  Don't eat me.
*  I'll give you some of this.
*  I shot at the buffalo.
*  We could all eat bro.
*  You tell me when other fucking asshole wolves are coming by.
*  I'll keep you hooked up with Buffalo.
*  There is that photo somebody posted recently of a woman that had a like half wolf half
*  timber wolf.
*  Do you see that?
*  And it was like too soft to look.
*  It was bigger than her.
*  It was.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It was.
*  I look like a monster.
*  It wasn't even a real wolf.
*  There's a lot of those half wolves or whatever they are.
*  Man, that's a strong gene.
*  That wolf gene.
*  If you mix it with a husky, you know, they're big man.
*  And some huskies are big.
*  There it is.
*  So that's how much wolf does it say?
*  Timber Wolf.
*  That says Colorado Wolf and Wildlife Center.
*  That's a real wolf, dude.
*  That's a wolf wolf.
*  That's not the same one I don't think.
*  Look how big that goddamn thing is.
*  If that thing is, imagine if that was a rat and it was trying to kill you.
*  Wolfs are way scarier than rats.
*  Look at the size of that thing, man.
*  It's got a collar on it though, no?
*  Is that a collar?
*  It looks like a collar.
*  It looks like something's around its neck, right?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  No, maybe not.
*  It's just the way it was.
*  Epstein.
*  Oh my God, it's licking her.
*  What would you do if she just reached down and starts jerking off?
*  Did you see that video going around over the break with that guy who has a pet tiger and
*  it comes at him and he just sticks his hand in its mouth?
*  Oh stop.
*  And it doesn't, it's his pet.
*  I can't.
*  It looks so crazy.
*  Does that motherfucker not know about Siegfried and Roy?
*  How does he not know about Siegfried and Roy?
*  Don't do that.
*  Hey, what do we know about the bounty?
*  Is that all that we were looking at before?
*  We were looking at something, you were trying to figure out whether, what was it that we
*  were trying to figure out was actually true?
*  The $80 million bounty.
*  Is that what it was?
*  I heard earlier it was $50 million, but let me check.
*  Listen, if nobody pays $80, then you know, somebody comes along and they say, I want
*  to do it for $45.
*  Yeah.
*  An $80 million bounty on Trump, George Lopez jokes, we'll do it for half.
*  That's so funny.
*  I guess you're not allowed to say that.
*  Well, that's about killing the president.
*  If they bring him his head, $80 million.
*  Whoa.
*  $80 million citizens contribute a dollar.
*  Oh, no, sorry.
*  If they did, is what it said.
*  Someone stole that.
*  Oh, if each of the country's 80 million citizens contributed $1, there'd be an $80 million
*  reward for anyone who brings us Trump's head.
*  George Lopez says, we'll do it for half.
*  That's what a comic says, folks.
*  That's funny.
*  Any other time, it's, you know what, man, when anybody could be the president, right,
*  in this sort of manner, is it really the same thing to threaten the president?
*  Is it the same thing as threatening Lincoln?
*  Is it the same thing to threaten Trump in a joke?
*  To threaten a guy, just think about it, who is a former game show host, who's a noted
*  baller, right?
*  A character in many, many rap songs because of his balling.
*  And he likes to talk shit on Twitter.
*  You can't make a joke?
*  You can't make that joke?
*  Like, that we'll do it for half?
*  You can't make that joke?
*  Some of the rap guys have gotten trouble for what they've been saying in their songs, though.
*  I know, but that's a weird one.
*  I mean, he's still the president, as much as it's-
*  I know, but that's where it's weird.
*  It's like, what does that mean?
*  What does that mean?
*  It means you're better than everybody?
*  Everybody?
*  Definitely better than everybody.
*  I can't pretend we're going to kill you.
*  Even talking about it, I think you can get in trouble.
*  What happened to Kathy Griffin when she showed that rubber head?
*  She had that rubber Trump head?
*  Nothing, right?
*  She got suspended from Twitter?
*  She lost her career?
*  I don't know.
*  No, she didn't get suspended from Twitter.
*  They gave her a bump in the algorithm.
*  It did fuck her career up.
*  Did it?
*  Yeah, a lot of cancellations of shows.
*  I'm sure.
*  I think she took some time off, too.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  Nobody thought Kathy Griffin was really going to murder Trump, right?
*  Right.
*  It might have been an artist type thing.
*  It might have been in poor days, especially since she knew him and she was on his show.
*  All of it is crazy, man.
*  It's all so crazy.
*  What else is going on?
*  Not much.
*  Is anything good in the movies?
*  I haven't done the movies in a long time.
*  I don't do movies anymore.
*  You give up?
*  I don't even do Netflix shows anymore.
*  I do a lot of YouTube stuff now and documentaries on YouTube.
*  I'm worried about that.
*  What?
*  I'm worried about that.
*  People are just going to only watch little...
*  I went to Saw and Cut Gems, Adam Sandler's new movie.
*  What is that?
*  That's a...
*  It's good.
*  It's a...
*  Jewelry movie, right?
*  Jewelry, he plays a degenerate gambler that works in the Diamond District in New York
*  and has an event like a crazy night.
*  It's good?
*  It's pretty good, yeah.
*  If you don't understand gambling and stuff like that, you might find inconsistencies
*  like you have with some of those other movies.
*  I heard it's cut really weird, frantic.
*  The movie was good.
*  I liked the movie as far as the movie was.
*  It was an enjoyable two hours at the theater.
*  That company, A24, has been putting out some awesome movies.
*  They did a couple ones I've seen this year.
*  I just noticed that that company does them.
*  I don't really know who's behind it or anything, but they did some other summertime movie,
*  which is about some cult in Poland or something where some girl goes and she gets kidnapped
*  and shit.
*  That was a pretty cool movie.
*  Didn't hear anything about that really.
*  I've seen some of the memes about it since then, but randomly went and saw it at the
*  Arclight and I was like, oh, it's a really good movie actually.
*  Yeah, I'd heard that Adam Sandler is a really good actor.
*  Yeah, I heard it's great.
*  I mean, you've got to think, he's been doing so many silly movies.
*  I heard it's edited weird though.
*  It's frantic editing or something.
*  It wasn't that weird compared to other movies.
*  What was the one that Christopher Nolan movie where the guy has tattoos and everything?
*  Memento where it's all like back and forth.
*  It's not weird like that or anything.
*  You can't pay attention or anything.
*  I love that movie, Memento.
*  That was a weird one.
*  He's got a new movie coming out that looked cool called Tenet.
*  It's all about time and the way time works and some soldiers going back and forth in
*  the time and the trailer looks fucking crazy.
*  I couldn't explain it off the trailer, but it's coming out soon.
*  Let me ask you both.
*  Are you guys worried about Iran?
*  Not too much.
*  Are you worried about what's happening here?
*  You worried about these military people making joint exercises?
*  When that happened, what was interesting I was going to bring up is that the LAPD made
*  some tweets that they're going to like, we're watching LA just in case everybody's worried
*  and they're like, what are you talking about?
*  And they're like, oh, I don't know.
*  We're just paying attention.
*  Huh.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not worried about as much as previous type stuff that's happened.
*  Like what?
*  Like with North Korea or you're worried more about North Korea.
*  I was more worried more about North Korea because that's an actual threat from, I think
*  a crazy person and where I think Iran, they're just going to try to kill Trump.
*  I don't think they're going to necessarily like, bro, if they kill Trump, it's going
*  to be chaos.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think, I don't, I don't think they're going to be able to do that.
*  I think if anything, this is the worst part has already happened.
*  I don't think so.
*  I think there's going to be some sort of retaliation.
*  Funeral that they showed on people were there.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy was in a Chevy.
*  So I noticed it's in a goddamn American truck.
*  Respect.
*  Why, why, why does this one concern you so much than like, you know,
*  Because it seems like this is the first example of someone being impulsive.
*  Someone making this kind of a decision that may be a strategy experts and real military
*  experts would have had some real good, I mean, this is just speculating, but that they
*  would have some real good reasons why this is a terrible idea and that there are other
*  methods of working things out that doesn't have to go this way.
*  It doesn't have to be, and this is not a movie.
*  This is real life.
*  Yeah.
*  But do you think they're just going to force them out then?
*  I don't know what's going to happen.
*  This almost seems like it's too good to be true for people that hate Trump.
*  Sort of.
*  If something happens, here's the thing.
*  If something happens, especially something horrible happens.
*  See the way America is, like we are like, we have the genes of this wild conqueror,
*  just lust for travel human that was willing to get on a fucking boat and make it over
*  here from Europe and from where every other place and then the slaves that were dragged
*  in here against their own will and then the other people that were imprisoned here and
*  they were, and then the Native Americans who got pushed out and the Mexicans who got put
*  that's, this is all thousands of years of genes, right?
*  The moment something goes crazy, that's when all that stuff comes out.
*  Like you remember how people were when 9-11 happened?
*  Everybody had an American flag on their car, man, everywhere.
*  It became an intense place.
*  Place where you like, you just, that whole break glass in case of war, like that's real.
*  If someone provokes, someone does something where we feel like we're really at war, we're
*  going to unite.
*  We're going to unite in a crazy way.
*  And the thing is a lot of people are going to love it.
*  They're going to feel great that we're united against an evil cause.
*  I mean this is why people have employed that strategy to convince their people to get into
*  war.
*  Hitler did it, right?
*  Didn't Hitler, he burned the Reichstag, right?
*  That was, he did that in order to get people more enthusiastic about his plans.
*  I'm pretty sure he did that.
*  And I think Nero did that with Rome as well.
*  But I'm an idiot and my memory's faulty.
*  So who knows?
*  You know way more than anybody.
*  No, definitely not.
*  Four weeks after he was sworn in an arson attack was performed on the Reichstag building.
*  Oh so it was arson.
*  So they think he did it in order to get people pumped up like, look, the Fuhrer was right.
*  Man I've been in the middle of this fourth Native American book, this blood and thunder
*  book.
*  That just happened.
*  Like the reason why I'm worried is not just because of the news, not just, but also because
*  of these goddamn books.
*  Where it talks about the Native American interactions with the soldiers and the settlers and fuck,
*  that is in our genes man.
*  It just happened.
*  People were horrible.
*  They did horrible things and it shatters this notion that so many of us love to hold
*  onto that without the Europeans here the Native Americans live peacefully.
*  They didn't live peacefully with each other.
*  No one ever has.
*  The Native Americans slaughtered each other.
*  They took each other's slave.
*  They killed each other.
*  They tortured each other.
*  The Comanches were known for it.
*  I mean it's horrific hearing these stories.
*  Horrific what the soldiers did too.
*  Horrific what the human beings of that era when forced into that conflict were willing
*  to do and what they were willing to become.
*  That is not that long ago man.
*  That's why I'm scared.
*  Well I'm scared because I feel like we have come so far.
*  It's so safe.
*  It's so safe that people don't even like saying that it's safe.
*  We like to be in denial about it and focus on so much of the inequality and inadequacies
*  and all the problems and the violence and this and that and they're right about all
*  those things.
*  But god damn this is a soft time to live and if some shit hits the fan you're all going
*  to know that.
*  When you're really worried about your life every day, when your loved ones really could
*  get shot and killed by someone who's a mile away with a scope because that's what's been
*  going on.
*  If that's what it comes down to you're going to understand how soft we had it.
*  You're going to really know how soft we had it.
*  And this is that cycle that everybody says, right?
*  Hard times make strong men.
*  Strong men make easy times.
*  Easy times make weak men.
*  This is a common, it's just how human beings are.
*  We need a motivation to kick ass.
*  We need some reason to rise to the top.
*  We need some reason to go out there and conquer.
*  And the best reason is if we get attacked.
*  If we get attacked we're going to go crazy.
*  It's going to be horrible.
*  I'm really scared.
*  Like I'm legitimately worried that people, some people are losing their grip on what
*  violence actually means.
*  And what war actually means because it's not happening over here.
*  And because it doesn't happen over here the only ones that can tell us are the ones that
*  went over there.
*  The ones that went over there and come back they do not paint pretty stories.
*  They paint stories of ugly people and dangerous people.
*  And they're like you got to be diligent because you got to be diligent and you got to be vigilant
*  because this world is not what you think it is.
*  There's a lot of parts of this world that are fucking chaos written and filled with
*  crime and filled with murder and filled with death and filled with despair.
*  And there's money there and there's terrorists and there's these religious fundamentalists
*  who want to throw gay people off roofs and that shit's real.
*  That's happening in 2020.
*  Right now somewhere in the world they're probably planning on throwing a gay guy off a roof.
*  Woo!
*  Because some person wrote that down 2000 years ago or whatever it was.
*  Fuck!
*  How was ice fishing?
*  I can't believe you went on that ice man.
*  It was disconcerting.
*  Was that scary as fuck?
*  Almost as disconcerting as like thinking about whether or not I should fart like whenever
*  you like this could be a bad idea.
*  Like walking with this diet walking out onto that ice it was only four inches thick I was
*  like oh it's fun though.
*  Did it make the cracking sound when you?
*  No it's solid as fuck.
*  There's a lot of people out there too.
*  Me and my friend Brent went and caught a couple rainbow trout.
*  That's great.
*  It was nice.
*  Ate it for lunch.
*  It was weird though.
*  It's a weird activity.
*  Freezing your ass off and you're standing still.
*  I don't like shit when you stand still.
*  Like my least favorite way of hunting is in a tree stand.
*  Just sitting around but it's also it's kind of crazy when it happens.
*  If you're hunting a deer in a tree stand it's most of the time you're just trying to keep
*  your shit together.
*  You might stand still for eight hours.
*  Just stand still or sit down depending on how you do it.
*  Some people lean against a tree.
*  You're harnessed in.
*  There's a bunch of different kinds of stands.
*  Some stands you stand on.
*  Some stands you sit down on.
*  Some are homemade.
*  You just it's just a mind game.
*  Just to sit and wait, sit and wait, sit and wait and make no sound so the deer don't know
*  you're there and then they walk through going to their normal corridors and you're going
*  to line it up and whish while they're walking.
*  A lot of times you stop them.
*  You have to stop them.
*  You have to go meh and they turn and you hit them with the arrow.
*  It's weird.
*  But that's that sitting still shit in the cold.
*  I don't like doing that.
*  When you move around in the cold it's not that bad.
*  Like if you have to go somewhere and you're well protected.
*  Like I went skiing this past weekend and I had a face mask on.
*  That's a game changer, son.
*  Neoprene face mask if you're going to ski.
*  Oh, that's a game changer.
*  I was like it had the holes for the mouth so I could breathe.
*  I was like this is a game changer.
*  Now I'm not cold.
*  Like I'm not even cold.
*  First time you use one?
*  Ever.
*  Really?
*  Ever.
*  Yeah.
*  Did they just tell you about it or?
*  No, I just thought it was for pussies.
*  What about goggles?
*  I wear goggles but I have gone out without goggles and your face gets burnt.
*  It's weird.
*  Your face gets burnt and your eyes don't look so good either.
*  It's like this is not good for my eyes.
*  I'm like staring at a light bulb.
*  It's very bright up there.
*  That sun burnt my eyes before.
*  I couldn't see for days.
*  Yeah, that's a real thing.
*  It's called snow blindness, right?
*  I wiped out though hard.
*  I was a little worried.
*  This lady lost control in front of me.
*  I was going around a corner and this lady just slid right into traffic.
*  Just went sideways.
*  She just didn't have...
*  She was probably just starting.
*  It looked like she was just starting out and I tried to avoid her and lost my left leg.
*  I went flying up and then I hit my head.
*  Like had a helmet on of course.
*  Snow wasn't really too hard packed but it was a good ding.
*  Like I got a little dizzy and I was like oh shit that's some brain damage I didn't need.
*  So do you always wear a helmet?
*  Always.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't want to die.
*  I remember wearing a helmet.
*  Bro, you could die.
*  You could die pretty easy without a helmet.
*  You definitely could.
*  I could have died from that even with a helmet.
*  People fall and hit their head and they die.
*  I mean I'm not...
*  I'm not worried that I was going to die when I fell.
*  I don't want to get you wrong.
*  But some people would have died from that same thing.
*  Like an older person or a person with an issue.
*  I think Liam Neeson's wife...
*  The woman who created Orange's New Black Suns.
*  Her son passed away this year.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  He was in a skiing accident, right?
*  Intermediate hill I think.
*  What'd he do?
*  Did he hit a tree?
*  That's what Sonny did, right?
*  Hit a tree?
*  Sonny Bono hit a tree.
*  So did one of the Kennedys.
*  Whew.
*  Bro, skiing's dangerous.
*  You're taking these crazy risks with all these people that might not know how to ski.
*  That's so fun.
*  Beautiful up there.
*  Very fun.
*  Fun times.
*  It's a good family thing.
*  And I think it's really good for kids to learn the kind of chaos that comes from skiing down
*  a hill.
*  That's chaotic, man.
*  Do they snowboard or ski like a grown adult?
*  Yeah, they ski like a grown adult.
*  And then tubing is another thing that's fun.
*  That's the shit.
*  Tubing is no risk though.
*  You don't learn the lessons you learn from skiing.
*  Skiing you learn how to keep your shit together.
*  Because you're in control.
*  No one's holding your hand.
*  You're going down this fucking stupid blue hill when you're not really ready for it.
*  And you gotta go sideways, sideways, sideways, sideways.
*  I was fine.
*  I was doing good.
*  Till the last day.
*  Some lady loses her shit right in front of me.
*  90s when skiing was more like a cocaine party event.
*  People used to, instead of tubes, I don't think they had lots of tubes out there, but
*  they would take the cafeteria trays and just slide down on those.
*  You know, crazy fucking college kids.
*  Yeah, cafeteria trays are good.
*  Trash can lids.
*  Hardboard boxes, like a big refrigerator box.
*  Jump on that bitch and slide down a hill.
*  The problem with that is another guy died out there recently too.
*  In Utah from, in the same area from avalanches.
*  This dickhead wanted to go off road and, sorry dickhead, sorry to call him a dickhead rather.
*  Sure he's just a man.
*  Man with dreams and a GoPro.
*  Dudes wanna, you know, they wanna make those videos and look like badasses.
*  They tell you never to do that too.
*  I feel bad for calling him dickhead.
*  Just a figure of speech folks.
*  There's a lot of those guys.
*  One guy that was on the show once with the rock climber.
*  Oh, Alex Honnold?
*  Yeah.
*  He's been on twice now.
*  He scares the shit out of me.
*  I've been watching a bunch of these videos of him.
*  YouTube started recommending him to me.
*  And I watched, I watched like two weeks ago, I watched like four or five in a row.
*  I watched like two hours of Alex climbing these horrific fucking mountain that even
*  thinking about it right now, my hands start sweating.
*  Imagine finding yourself halfway up and not wanting to do it anymore.
*  And you have this life changing moment like, I don't want to do this anymore.
*  But you got to keep going bitch.
*  I like the trail running videos where they're on the spine of a mountain.
*  Oh no.
*  No, I don't like that at all.
*  I don't like that at all.
*  I can barely stay upright when I'm running on a regular trail.
*  I think they have that new workout machine, not the Pentagon or whatever it's called,
*  but the other one where it shows, what's it called?
*  Patreon.
*  Peloton.
*  Peloton.
*  The Pentagon.
*  It's not like true ideas there.
*  That fucking cocksucker.
*  What the fucking Peloton?
*  But they have the other new one where it's like, it's like where you're jogging on the
*  side of a mountain or something like that.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's like that.
*  Yeah.
*  One of those life bars.
*  It's a 40% incline and you follow a trail runner.
*  That is cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Well there's something about it.
*  I've done elliptical machines that show you a trail.
*  When I was in Hawaii, the gym had this elliptical machine and you could start running a trail.
*  And while you're doing that, it feels like you're getting somewhere.
*  Yeah, but there's something different when you're literally walking up to Runyon and
*  you have all, you're looking at the dust and you're going to die and then you turn around
*  and you see the entire skyline of Los Angeles.
*  You win.
*  Miles and miles.
*  Yeah, you win.
*  Way better.
*  Yeah, it's better.
*  You're right.
*  100%.
*  VR elliptical.
*  Is that a thing?
*  You'll fall off and die.
*  Yeah.
*  You'll fall off and die.
*  No, they were going to, they had this thing called the unidirectional treadmill and the
*  way it works is like, it's like that other treadmill that we have, the air runner.
*  When the air runner, you do it by using your own feet to propel it.
*  They'll have that with a unidirectional treadmill and then you'll be harnessed in at the waist.
*  So there'll be some sort of cables and some sort of a suspension system so that you can't
*  ever actually fall out of it, but you won't feel it too much while you're just running
*  around.
*  It was just sort of like roughly guides your treadmill in which way you want to go, but
*  you always, you always go, you never hit anything.
*  You never run into anything.
*  It still seems nauseating somehow.
*  For sure.
*  Your body's going to be so confused.
*  It's going to be weird, man, but it's, it's the future.
*  We're getting one step closer.
*  I don't know how much is going to be announced at CES this weekend, but I've saw these gloves
*  a couple of weeks ago, or they're like, I believe the first haptic feedback gloves for
*  VR and development.
*  You're going to put them right in your deck, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I knew Half Life.
*  Get my haptic on.
*  How much virtual reality porn is there?
*  It's still not good.
*  Well, tell me.
*  There's a lot.
*  There's a lot.
*  He's like the sister and the e-bird of...
*  It's just not good.
*  I don't know.
*  Like it's, it's not, it doesn't, I don't know.
*  It doesn't feel that insane as you think it would be amazing sitting there, but then half
*  the time videos, you're like, wait, I'm the woman and I have the boobs.
*  No, wait.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, oh, you look down like you're a lesbian and you watch other lesbians and guys
*  fucking you.
*  That's not what I want.
*  That's not what you want.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't look down from the guy either.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone's got to make an interactive one.
*  And I don't know.
*  That sounds very difficult to do.
*  Yeah.
*  I was thinking about like, you can watch a video, but watch me if you want to grab something
*  and have a reaction happen, like program that.
*  If Iran really wants to cripple our world, that's what they'll do.
*  They'll develop that game.
*  Think about how people can't put down roadblocks or, or fucking Candy Crush.
*  What are the wacky games people can't leave alone?
*  Just imagine how bad it would be if that thing made you come.
*  A game that makes you come.
*  Great.
*  The better you do, the better it feels when this game sucks your dick.
*  Do you know how good people would be at that game?
*  So is there a limit per day then?
*  Think about how difficult it is, right?
*  For someone to get so good at BMX riding that people want to fuck you.
*  Not saying it's impossible.
*  It's possible for sure that a lot of like the high level BMX guys, girls just throw
*  themselves at them, right?
*  Guys are savage out there doing flips and shit.
*  Think of how good you have to get at that before someone actually wants to suck your
*  dick.
*  You gotta get really good, right?
*  For that being the reason why they want to have sex with you.
*  That's the reason.
*  So now think about it.
*  Let's cut the human choice thing out of it and make it just a level that you have to
*  reach in this video game.
*  Make it just you have to be really good at this video game.
*  And then this Russian robot lady sucks your dick.
*  But you feel it in real life.
*  Do you know how good kids would get at it?
*  Or it would be the fastest hacked game of all time.
*  Just cheat codes.
*  That's a good point.
*  Because it's just impossible to do.
*  Because unless we connected it to some sort of fucking blockchain grid that's impenetrable
*  and that's the only way you could get out the Russian fuck doll.
*  That's the only way.
*  You just hacked a million jizzes a day fast.
*  Yeah, but you can't hack.
*  You can't hack.
*  You have to show your skill at every level.
*  Like a speed run.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just trying to think.
*  Is there a way to not hack that?
*  You're a fatalist.
*  You've killed my dreams.
*  Yeah, we were talking about prostitution earlier.
*  That would be like, how are you going to stop that?
*  How are you going to stop that?
*  If you say you can't pay for sex.
*  Okay, but can I pay for a thing that feels exactly like sex and I think it's sex while
*  I'm doing it?
*  Or is it like if you get into a simulation, the simulation lets you murder people and
*  then you come out of the simulation like, hey, you're going to jail.
*  Like, but there wasn't even a real person.
*  Yeah, but you're the kind of piece of shit that if that situation happened, you would
*  kill somebody.
*  You just killed somebody and you didn't even know it was a simulation.
*  Therefore you're a piece of shit.
*  That's a thought crime.
*  You can't pay, but you can give gifts, right?
*  You trade gifts.
*  You can.
*  You could be, I'm a happy fella.
*  I like to give away money to beautiful girls.
*  You need to get your toes done.
*  I need to get my cock sucked.
*  What do you say?
*  Give it a try.
*  I don't think you can spell it out.
*  I don't think you can say like, hey, I'll give you this Ferrari if you fuck me.
*  Well, it doesn't have to be a Ferrari.
*  I mean, there's got to be a limitation for the value.
*  Listen, if you're Bill Gates, you might want to just start throwing Ferraris around.
*  Everybody knows you got 90 billion.
*  Derek Jeter gave away those nice gift bags for everyone.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Signed baseball.
*  That was just a nice consolation prize.
*  Thanks for fucking me.
*  I'll see you later.
*  The thing about girls never have to feel bad about banging their fans.
*  Like if someone like Miley Cyrus wanted to start fucking her way through the hottest
*  guys that like her, everybody would be like, you go girl.
*  Imagine if Miley Cyrus started giving out gift bags every time she fucked dudes.
*  Hey, thanks for the dick.
*  Have yourself a little fucking nut cake.
*  Have yourself a fruitcake.
*  This is my favorite vegan coconut drink.
*  See ya.
*  Left by the door.
*  Kick rocks.
*  Kick rocks, you pervert.
*  You hear that Instagram girl that she got banned from Instagram?
*  She was an Instagram chick.
*  And so she got to like help out.
*  She decided to put out for $10, she'll send you a naked picture.
*  In like one week, I think she's made like $700,000.
*  It was for donations for the Australian fires.
*  Yeah, for the Australian fires.
*  But she's kicked off of Instagram for that?
*  No, no.
*  She got kicked off of Instagram and so she's like, you know what, I'm just going to start
*  selling pictures of me naked then.
*  I think Instagram should have her back on.
*  She's doing a lot of good.
*  Yeah, they should.
*  For real.
*  She's raised that much money to help the Australian wildlife?
*  Yeah, that deactivated her account, it says.
*  Come on, man.
*  That's mean.
*  She violated rules about sexual content.
*  Come on, she's doing it for a good cause, you fucks.
*  Whoa.
*  Let her be naked.
*  What are you stopping her from being naked for, you creeps?
*  Why does Twitter let you be naked, but Instagram doesn't?
*  Because Twitter's better.
*  The naked philanthropist.
*  She's only 20?
*  Oh, poor girl.
*  She doesn't know what she's doing yet.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Hip hop hooray.
*  I'm sending nudes to every person who donates at least $10 to any one of these fundraisers
*  for wildfires in Australia.
*  Every $10 you donate equals one nude picture from me to your DM.
*  You must send me confirmation that you donated.
*  That girl does not have a lot of hobbies.
*  That must take forever.
*  She does not have the free time.
*  Damn, she's hot though.
*  Wow, look at that.
*  Those are definitely real.
*  She raised more than $500,000.
*  Wow, that's amazing.
*  Let her back, Instagram, come on.
*  But she said she was going to give the money to that and she didn't show pictures, right?
*  That's sex work, I guess.
*  I mean, you're using a transit.
*  I would imagine it's really because Instagram wouldn't get the cut.
*  They're getting a dollar out of every transaction.
*  Maybe it's a little more.
*  That's why Snapchat has like Snapcash.
*  Yeah, they don't have a PayPal thing and built in Instagram.
*  Do you think that's what, are you that cynical?
*  I've heard them do that for other things.
*  That's what a lot of the ad changes were about and why they don't let influencers do ad things
*  anymore is because they're not getting a piece.
*  Wait a minute, they don't?
*  No, they were like, why there have been a bunch of changes?
*  Because they're not getting a piece of all those ad sales that's going directly through
*  the influencer.
*  That's just what I've read online.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, whenever I see one of those sponsored ads, it's like, what's happening here?
*  Yeah, you're supposed to put that hashtag ad after everything.
*  Weird.
*  It is weird.
*  Ads are weird.
*  Like, dudes are holding up a CBD bomb while they're rubbing their legs.
*  It's weird.
*  Social media, the ability to make money on social media is so new, no one knows what
*  to do with it.
*  And it's like porn.
*  This is why it's like porn.
*  The fucking, the people in porn always figure out first how to push the boundaries of the
*  technology.
*  Like, technology when it comes to streaming, streaming video, high resolution video, all
*  that stuff, that's all pushed, a lot of it's pushed by porn.
*  Just the amount of bandwidth involved in porn.
*  Love the charts.
*  This is like that.
*  Don't you think?
*  They must have figured out password protected content first because there's a bunch hidden
*  that's not free, you know, like there's a pay version of those sites and there's a free
*  version but.
*  I don't know how they figured out how to get money off those things.
*  Who would go to pay?
*  You got to be a serious pervert to say what's available online.
*  It's just not enough for my tastes.
*  I forget somebody we know very well.
*  I feel damn it.
*  Has that an account?
*  Yeah, he just told me, he's like, oh yeah, I'd like to support.
*  Oh, guys, supports the artist.
*  He wants to marry one of those girls.
*  He wants to marry one.
*  Well, nothing wrong with that.
*  Some people are into that shit.
*  They're like, what'd you do today, honey?
*  Show me your work.
*  Oh, you bad girl.
*  You bad girl.
*  You took all those dicks.
*  Some guys like that.
*  You're a bad girl.
*  Hey, I'm a bad girl, daddy.
*  You want to take one more dick?
*  I'll take it for you.
*  If Starbucks started giving me free coffee, I don't think anybody's going to keep paying
*  for it, would they?
*  Hmm.
*  Some people would if they knew they were going to help Guatemala or something.
*  Don't you think?
*  No?
*  What do you think?
*  If it was like only one kind of coffee, you know what I mean?
*  Like, like if you couldn't get free iced coffees or free cold brews or lesbian coffee.
*  Yeah.
*  No coffee.
*  You can only get decaf for free.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  I was at a place the other day that only had decaf espresso.
*  It's all they had.
*  We only have decaf espresso.
*  I'm like, who the fuck drinks decaf espresso?
*  Because espresso, you can't even pretend that it's worth it for those little bitter sips.
*  There's still a little bit in there.
*  There's still a little bit.
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But it's real small, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But like the idea of an espresso is everybody thinks espresso is way stronger than it is.
*  Yeah, it's not.
*  No, that's wrong.
*  It's just less liquid.
*  I just like the flavor of it, but I like to know that it's got a little jolt to it.
*  I feel like an asshole if I was drinking decaf espresso.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Regular espresso seems totally normal, but decaf espresso, why?
*  It's just because people, for health reasons.
*  My mom can't drink caffeine.
*  At all?
*  No, because it gives her heart palpitations and shit like that.
*  What about the amount that's in decaf?
*  That's so small it doesn't matter.
*  Oh, really?
*  I thought it wasn't that small.
*  I saw some people arguing, some company's going to stop testing people for nicotine
*  usage.
*  I forget which one.
*  And then people were being like, oh, there's nicotine in all these foods.
*  You're going to have to test them for that.
*  Smart people were like, yes, it's in there, but it's so minimal that you have to eat
*  thousands of eggplants to get one pack of cigarettes.
*  It's like poppy seeds.
*  Oh, thousands.
*  Yeah.
*  So your mom, what happened with her experience with it?
*  She gets only decaf espresso because she loves the taste of coffee, but she can't have caffeine.
*  She likes espresso though?
*  Yeah.
*  Hmm.
*  I guess it tastes the same.
*  There's a bunch of different kinds of espresso.
*  There's different beans and shit.
*  Some people make it super bitter.
*  The people that love doing that cranky machine too, pop it in there and crank it and tap
*  it down.
*  I like those Nespresso capsules.
*  Pop those bitches in.
*  I don't have to think too much.
*  Meanwhile, there's turtles out there choking the desk, belly full of them.
*  Probably, right?
*  It's aluminum though.
*  It's not plastic, but still.
*  Fuck turtles, man.
*  When was the last time you saw a turtle?
*  I saw a turtle in Hawaii.
*  Once.
*  You see straws every day.
*  They're beautiful to see.
*  They're cool to see.
*  I don't know.
*  I see straws more.
*  Yeah, but here's the thing.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  The problem really is waste management.
*  That's the problem.
*  How the fuck does the waste get in the ocean in the first place?
*  You tell me it's inevitable, that everyone's so gross that all the garbage has to get in
*  the ocean no matter what.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  I think we need to do a way better job of collecting garbage and treating garbage and
*  treating our own garbage and just come up with a more comprehensive plan to avoid all
*  this shit getting into the ocean.
*  There's just not enough funding in our time and Greta Thornburg is only 16.
*  She can only do so much.
*  They used to feed it to pigs before they figured out landfills.
*  Oh really?
*  Did they?
*  Yeah.
*  They ate everything?
*  As much as they could, I think.
*  Wow.
*  The restaurant should be fine.
*  Why would they do that again?
*  Because the pigs got sick.
*  Everybody's sick.
*  People got sick eating the pig meat.
*  What is this?
*  Spam was made.
*  I think it was Ari.
*  It was either Ari or Callan.
*  It might have been Callan that told me they were in China and there was a restaurant that
*  had a toilet and the toilet was a hole.
*  Ari.
*  Was it Ari?
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, no.
*  But in the hole at the bottom was pigs.
*  He was shitting into a pig's dye and the pigs would eat your shit and this is common.
*  I'm pretty sure it was Callan.
*  What in the fuck?
*  Ari definitely told me he had a shit into a hole.
*  I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  He also got chased out of a Chinese girl's house by a man with a baseball bat.
*  Right.
*  Something about street oil or something like that.
*  The food was cooked using the oil from the streets.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  That's a different story.
*  This is a story that I almost forgot about until you just said that.
*  That's a story of them.
*  That's what Ari brought.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Sewer water.
*  Sewer water.
*  They're making cooking oil out of sewer water.
*  There's literally people going into the sewer and turning that shit water into cooking oil.
*  I know you're saying there's no way.
*  It makes sense.
*  I can see Asians doing that.
*  How dare you raise this piece of shit.
*  No.
*  My girlfriend is Asian and she likes the grossest shit ever, like blood, soup.
*  View from the inside of a pig toilet.
*  So there it is.
*  That's kind of cool.
*  I wonder if that pig thinks he's a fucking pig.
*  Minority village somewhere in Yunnan province, China.
*  The pig followed me to the toilet and positioned itself under it waiting.
*  I was very confused when I started using toilet paper for reasons.
*  Oh my god, because it was licking his asshole.
*  Yeah, I just googled it and pig toilet just started coming up.
*  I tried to shit right on the pig's face.
*  That is so gross.
*  Now go see if you find cooking oil made from sewage.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  I know a lot of people are like, wait, what?
*  No, I think it was Vice.
*  I think Vice had a video on it.
*  And it was all about how there's a market for people making cooking oil in these really
*  poor towns.
*  They literally climb into the sewers and they take out human shit and turn it into cooking
*  oil.
*  Gutter oil they call it.
*  Gutter oil.
*  Gutter.
*  Disgusting recycled oil and sewage.
*  Illicit cooking oil which has been recycled from waste oil collected from sources such
*  as restaurant fires, grease traps, slaughterhouse waste and sewage from sewer drains.
*  Look at that one on the far right.
*  It says Chinese gutter oil.
*  You click on that.
*  Disgusting.
*  This is the video that I've seen before.
*  Recycled oil and sewage used to cook Chinese street food.
*  Jesus Christ, bro.
*  They get into the potty and then they filter all the poop out and they get the oil.
*  These filters get the oil out of the poop and then they cook your noodles in that.
*  That's why we need regulation.
*  Would you taste it?
*  That's why we need America.
*  Young Turks.
*  It was them.
*  They did one too.
*  Oh yeah, definitely.
*  Yeah, this guy opens up or this woman rather opens up.
*  Oh, she's scooping out shit.
*  Please shut that off.
*  I literally almost threw up.
*  That would have been good.
*  Is the Young Turks from RT or whatever it's called?
*  TYT.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that the Russian?
*  No, it's a different thing.
*  What's the Russian thing that started all the propaganda against 5G?
*  That's Internet Research Agency.
*  The IRA.
*  Against who?
*  5G.
*  Where they were saying like 5G is bad for you.
*  Oh, did they do that?
*  Yeah.
*  The IRA did that?
*  I think so.
*  Man.
*  The 5G shit, like that propaganda is interesting.
*  It's RT.
*  There's an article that says RT America has been sowing disinformation.
*  Oh, RT has been sowing disinformation.
*  Yeah, they're the ones that started all this shit because I guess it's supposed...
*  Your 5G phone won't hurt you, but Russia wants you to think otherwise.
*  Okay.
*  A network known for sowing disinformation has a new alarm.
*  The coming 5G apocalypse.
*  Who is...
*  Is this New York Times?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting that you said New York Times because in New York Times, if they're printing
*  something, like that's one of the places that I'd kind of say, if they're saying it, it's
*  probably true.
*  But then you see what they did to Cenk Yuger from the Young Turks?
*  He was interviewing David Duke and he goes, of course you're not a racist.
*  He's mocking him.
*  Mocking him.
*  And they took it out of context in quotes and they wrote that he said to David Duke,
*  of course you're not a racist.
*  They tried to pretend.
*  Somebody just got too woke for their own good.
*  Somebody crossed the line.
*  They crossed the line.
*  They want to stop him.
*  They wanted to stop him.
*  And so they got over woke.
*  They lied.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a crazy lie though for that to get into the New York Times.
*  I wonder what the fallout from that was because for them, that's got to be very embarrassing
*  that someone actually printed that because they were forced to make a retraction.
*  But the problem with that is when people hear about stuff like that, there's a lot
*  of people obviously working at the New York Times.
*  A lot of people.
*  So it doesn't represent everybody there.
*  But when someone gets away with something sneaky like that, it really fucks over everybody
*  else because then all the other people that are making stories, people are going to go,
*  yeah, you're the fucking people that said that Cenk Yuger said David Duke wasn't a racist
*  when that's clearly not what he said.
*  Your fucking magazine's fake news.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  You're a shit newspaper.
*  Congratulations.
*  You're going to fuel that.
*  And the New York Times used to have none of that, right?
*  They used to have none of that.
*  Maybe they should have a correction.
*  Dad, that doesn't mean anything.
*  I don't see anything else from that.
*  The correction's too late.
*  It's in a newspaper.
*  How many corrections a year do they do is what I would like to know.
*  Well how many people read the correction versus read the original story?
*  That's what gets real weird.
*  Like if you make something up about someone and put it down or make something and interpret
*  it incorrectly on purpose intentionally and then you put it out there, how much responsibility
*  does the newspaper have and how much responsibility does that writer have for doing that?
*  They probably don't like them.
*  They don't want them to do it.
*  They figure like, fuck this guy.
*  He fucking said it.
*  Did he actually say it?
*  He did say it.
*  I don't know what he meant.
*  Do you know what he meant?
*  Fucking print it.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what the process was.
*  But you can't do that if you want us to take you seriously.
*  But there's still one of the number one.
*  I still take them seriously.
*  I take them seriously most of the time.
*  There was another one they did with Conor McGregor.
*  Back when Conor McGregor fought Floyd and they said his face was bloodied.
*  I'm like, no it wasn't.
*  He didn't have any blood.
*  You guys are making things up.
*  You can't make things up.
*  Did they retract that?
*  Yes.
*  They did.
*  Because you said it.
*  They did.
*  But they had to.
*  Everybody saw it.
*  You know the arrogance that you have to have to pretend that you saw something that wasn't
*  Either that or you're paying attention so loosely before you write the story that you
*  don't even give a fuck how the fight went and you're going to report on the fight.
*  Come on man.
*  You can't do that.
*  You got to stop.
*  You're the New York Times.
*  You're not a podcast.
*  Get a podcast if you want to spread misinformation and talk stupid shit.
*  That's the difference.
*  Nobody takes us seriously.
*  They take the fucking New York Times seriously.
*  You have to.
*  You got a serious job.
*  Okay?
*  It's like if you're a cop.
*  You got a serious job.
*  You're a reporter reporting the actual news.
*  You got a serious job because you can change the way people look at things.
*  And it might be a lie.
*  And that's got us into a lot of problems in the past.
*  People always think they know better though.
*  They know better than what everybody else wants.
*  That's where it's a real problem.
*  You think you're doing good by withholding information or you think you're doing good
*  by censoring people.
*  Do you get your news mostly from Twitter or something?
*  I don't get my news from anywhere anymore.
*  I feel great.
*  I looked at a newspaper the other day.
*  I picked it up and I'm like, what happened over there?
*  I forget what it was about.
*  It was a story about something.
*  And I was like, I didn't know that.
*  I read into it a little bit.
*  It was in the Wall Street Journal.
*  I was like, I got other shit to think about.
*  It's a terribly irresponsible way to look at things.
*  It's a hilarious quote.
*  I don't know if you can do that much.
*  I don't know what the responsibility is, like ultimately to completely pay attention to
*  everything all the time.
*  I don't know what responsibility you have.
*  People get mad at you if you don't completely pay attention to everything that's of importance
*  all the time.
*  And they had a point.
*  They have a point.
*  But you also have a point for like self-management and for mental management to probably pay
*  attention to less shit.
*  I feel healthier and happier when I pay attention to less shit.
*  Why does Iran think it's got me fucked up?
*  Because if something makes me think about it, that means it's in the forefront of the
*  news now.
*  It's like big.
*  It's a big deal.
*  I'm like, oh, dude, do you see that fucking, that the meme that someone made when they
*  put up on Instagram about a day after world feminist, the day after World War III starts?
*  It's an old timey 1950s lady in the oven baking.
*  She's got an apron on and shit.
*  She's got the oven door open.
*  She's making some nice cookies.
*  Hilarious.
*  Boy, all these teeny tiny whiny beta males that have been posturing for attention and
*  virtue signaling and what a rude awakening it's going to be if war breaks out.
*  War is the scariest shit of all time that people are so convinced that no matter, besides
*  all the other threats that face us, disease and injury and accidents and death and all
*  this other shit, that we're absolutely convinced that we're always going to have war.
*  I never met any one person that thinks we're never going to have war again.
*  Have you?
*  There's never been a time.
*  Where are you going to move?
*  Canada maybe?
*  Canada?
*  No.
*  That's not bad, especially they light this place up.
*  I still lean towards Texas or Colorado.
*  Texas is a good move.
*  I like Texas.
*  Texas is a good move too if you don't want to fuck with the winter.
*  Yeah.
*  I just can't do the fucking snow driving.
*  The humidity, that is a little too much.
*  Gets rough.
*  Gets real rough down by the ocean.
*  Like Houston area, that gets rough in the summer.
*  Remember that?
*  Fuck that.
*  We'd be there in July and August and be like, fuck.
*  It gets hot.
*  I'll be there in two days.
*  What are you doing?
*  Kill Tonys.
*  Oh, we're at.
*  Which comedy shows?
*  Secret Group and the LOL Comedy Club in San Antonio.
*  How's the scene in Houston these days?
*  Houston's great.
*  They have the Secret Group, which is an amazing club that's owned by a bunch of comics.
*  Oh, beautiful.
*  And we're going to have Skank Fest there this year or two.
*  When is that?
*  I want to say it's February, March around that area.
*  March, I think.
*  Yeah, so that'll be good.
*  It's nice to see scenes.
*  Scenes staying a lot.
*  That was like an ember for a while.
*  They had a fucking great scene at the laugh stop, man.
*  A lot of people, they don't remember.
*  We have to talk about it for people to get an understanding of what it was like.
*  Remember when they had that really good open mic that went all night?
*  I love that place.
*  That place was awesome.
*  And then that place across the street we ate at, Bebus or whatever.
*  Yeah, that place was great.
*  The thing about that place was that the dude who ran it was just too crazy.
*  He was too crazy.
*  He was just too much drugs, too much chaos, too much.
*  And then the other guy took over and tried to make it a little corporate.
*  And then it was like, well, this kind of existed the way it was before because a crazy person
*  ran it.
*  You know, in a lot of ways like the store.
*  The store's figured out the sweep balance, though.
*  And letting crazy people run it, but also have a business mind and keeping it together.
*  But just saying, oh, this is an interesting business deal, but this is basically the best
*  way to make it run.
*  Can't beat the store.
*  I love it.
*  It's the best.
*  But I remember I'd heard that Gene Garofalo had moved to Houston.
*  That might be fake news.
*  But I was in Boston and I remember saying, what?
*  I'm like, who the fuck is in Houston?
*  And Kinesom was in Houston.
*  And Bill Hicks was in Houston.
*  So Houston at one point in time was a hub, man.
*  Like there was some beasts coming out of, particularly Kinesom.
*  When Kinesom burst out of Houston, everybody was like, holy shit.
*  The best comic in the world came from Texas?
*  How the fuck?
*  Because for those two years that Kinesom was on top, he was a fucking tornado, man.
*  He was a tornado.
*  He was just ripping houses out of the foundations and throwing them through the air.
*  And that was all from Texas.
*  So I'd heard a bunch of people had moved down there.
*  Because this is like, I want to say like late 80s.
*  Like late 80s, early 90s.
*  Kinesom died I think in like 91 or 92 or something like that.
*  But Texas, Austin has a really good scene too.
*  Austin, Dallas, like all of Texas.
*  Always has.
*  Have you ever thought about moving to Texas?
*  Yes.
*  I love it there.
*  Me too.
*  I fucking love it there.
*  I'm a fan of California.
*  Yee-haw!
*  I'm gonna get a ranch.
*  Woo!
*  Live from the ranch.
*  The new JRE.
*  Yeah, I'll have a fucking cowboy hat on and a snake tie.
*  Meat all day.
*  Barbecue meat.
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know how long you'll be able to keep up this carnivore tie.
*  It seems to have subsided.
*  But for a couple of days, it was literally touch and go.
*  Like my dick would like tingle a little bit.
*  My butthole would pucker up.
*  And I'd go, uh-oh.
*  You better keep that vault shut.
*  It would be like, eee!
*  Try explaining to someone who's never taken a shit what it feels like if you know you
*  have diarrhea but you haven't experienced, you know that feeling?
*  Like oh, this one's a problem.
*  You know that feeling?
*  Like how sensitive is the inner wall of your butthole?
*  It's a ticking time bomb because you know it's going to happen too.
*  Right, but if you don't know you have diarrhea, you know that there's moments where you're
*  like, oh, this is not good.
*  Where it came out of nowhere?
*  Well, you think you have it.
*  I got to get to a toilet immediately.
*  Like there's an urgency to the feeling that you have.
*  Like your butthole is like, hey, eee!
*  And you're like, what's going on down there, guys?
*  And you know, like I got to get to a bathroom right now.
*  You don't even know why you know.
*  Like if you had to describe to someone, tell me what it's like when you know you're about
*  to have explosive diarrhea.
*  What's the feeling?
*  Pressure.
*  You have pressure.
*  That's not good enough.
*  That sounds like you're giving birth.
*  It sounds like you had a rock in your pocket.
*  It's more than pressure.
*  There's a heat.
*  You know the heat that you feel?
*  Like sometimes if you got hot diarrhea, like the inside of your butthole heats up and you're
*  like, whoa, this is going to be a problem.
*  I love it when it's a suicide bomber.
*  When you just sit down.
*  It's a great feeling of satisfaction that you actually made it to a toilet when that
*  happens.
*  When you just fill up that bowl with water.
*  Yeah, I took a shit.
*  The third or fourth day of this diet that I took a picture of because there was no solid
*  to it.
*  It was black splatter.
*  Oh God.
*  I hate when it's black.
*  But it was so dark.
*  Like I would imagine the devil shit would look like.
*  Send it to a doctor to make sure you're good.
*  No, you guys are doctors, right?
*  Well, I just want you to know and what you know what kind of stuff I'm dealing with.
*  Oh no.
*  And I want to know what everybody thinks.
*  I need to know your opinion.
*  I mean, is this a concern or no?
*  Should I be concerned?
*  What's going on?
*  Oh, oh God, dude.
*  That's no, no, that's that looks like a mouse, a computer mouse.
*  Take a look at that.
*  It's all fluid, black fluid, dark, dark, like a Corvette.
*  That's yeah.
*  The rap go piss.
*  Because when I said when I Google, you know, shit problems or say like if it's ever black
*  or if it looks like sand or something like that, you should go to a doctor.
*  Both have problems.
*  Sean Baker was telling me that I don't know if this is true or not.
*  I'll read you what he said, because I will definitely butcher this.
*  Bear in mind, he is an actual doctor.
*  He is a I mean, that's the blackest I've ever seen.
*  And I thought I had black shit before.
*  It's not even shit, though.
*  It's like it's liquid.
*  It's like oil.
*  Yeah, it's a disaster.
*  Speaking of the ship, I show some of my friends the juclion video the other day.
*  I never heard of it.
*  You should put that away.
*  It's not good.
*  Hold on.
*  Let me find it.
*  Where did you send it to me?
*  Hold on a second, please.
*  My apologies.
*  Talk amongst yourself for a moment.
*  Do you have a toto or do you have a?
*  Oh, no, I would want to get the what we have here that brondle.
*  Yeah.
*  One thousand heated seat, heated water.
*  Yeah, it's the best.
*  What is that?
*  That the bidet, the bidet we have here.
*  But the air is a little weird.
*  The air conditioner.
*  Like when you do it, the air dryer because it's blowing.
*  You know, what's weird is I didn't like it, but I've grown to like it.
*  Like it's smelling your ass.
*  It's just like it makes the whole plate your the whole room smell like your butthole.
*  It's kind of weird.
*  No.
*  What?
*  The air dryer.
*  The air dryer.
*  It's just blowing your butthole in your face.
*  I didn't like it at first, but now it's hard.
*  I can't find this dude's message.
*  I know he sent it to me, but I can't find it.
*  Mine it opens up the seat when you come in and everything like that.
*  But sometimes my girlfriend like unplugs it to use the hairdryer.
*  Is there another level?
*  Have you had a better bidet than the one you we have here?
*  Like, is there a level to it?
*  I mean, there might be.
*  I don't know of one, though.
*  The Toto is really good.
*  I recommend the Toto.
*  The one we have is pretty good.
*  I feel very guilty when I go through a whole water cycle up my butt, though.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like I'm a bad person.
*  I even posted a video of a picture of it one time.
*  We were at that one hotel that had a hose next to it.
*  Like I still don't understand what the fuck you're supposed to do with that.
*  Apparently it has to do with some religions.
*  Some religion thing.
*  You're not supposed to wipe your ass with anything.
*  You just blast that sucker.
*  This is what someone told me.
*  I think maybe a limo driver.
*  I might be making this up.
*  It's a shit butt naked, basically.
*  Yes.
*  That's what you're supposed to do.
*  Shit shower shave.
*  Come on, you fucking monster.
*  Let me find this dude's text message to me.
*  I told him I'm doing it and then I told him I'm having some rock hard diarrhea.
*  Did you know that in photos on your iPhone that you could search by, like, if you just
*  type in car, it knows what cars are and it would bring up photos?
*  I was trying to find this picture of a person's tooth and I just typed in tooth in photos
*  and searched and it found all these people's close-ups of their smiles and stuff.
*  I didn't know that you could search photos.
*  I found this message.
*  Here, hold on a second.
*  It says for some reason, for some people too many eggs can lead to diarrhea.
*  That was not the case for me.
*  I wasn't eating that many eggs.
*  Hardly any eggs.
*  Most of the time it's just the colon adapting.
*  Oops, I lost it there.
*  Shit.
*  God damn it.
*  Search for colon adapting.
*  You'll get there.
*  I had it though.
*  53 messages.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  See, here's the thing about all this stuff is there's a lot of dispute, like a lot, a
*  lot of dispute, what people think is and isn't true about nutrition and diet.
*  That is one of the more confusing things about talking to all these different people.
*  What is okay and what's not okay?
*  What's healthy and what's not healthy?
*  How much difference does it make biologically between people?
*  Healthy for you but not healthy for me?
*  Is that real?
*  How does one find it's a fucking long road to try to sort all this stuff out?
*  So when people start talking about why something gives you diarrhea, I'm like, hmm, I don't
*  know if that's true.
*  It says the colon's adapting to a relatively higher amount of liquid, leaving the small
*  intestine than we're used to on a high fiber diet.
*  I don't know.
*  We're going to find out.
*  Yeah, it seems to me, I find it odd that you have diarrhea on a meat diet.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah, it's just weird.
*  But what he's saying is if your colon is used to high fiber, which captivates some of the
*  liquid and then it would cause that fiber to swell up and then it comes out in the form
*  of watery shit.
*  So instead, there's none of that.
*  It's just meat.
*  So you got the plop plop, that's the meat, and then everything else is liquid.
*  Yikes!
*  Are you drinking more liquid too, do you think?
*  Because you're filling space or water or coffee?
*  I'm definitely drinking a good amount of liquid.
*  I'm being healthy about it.
*  We bought these body composition scales that you get on, but it said I should be 142 pounds
*  and then I'm 59 pounds of fat.
*  That's not true.
*  So it's a piece of shit.
*  Yeah, those things are not true.
*  I talked to my doctor about it today.
*  He said the real ones have a handle.
*  There's a handle on one side and then it goes across your body.
*  So it gets you from the floor up and then it gets you across your body with these wires
*  that you hold onto.
*  And it gets a better scan.
*  But the best scan is when you go into an immersion tank and then they find out what your body
*  composition is.
*  And there's more complicated machinery involved.
*  I know the UFC has some body composition scanner you lay down.
*  That's a different level.
*  That's probably the one that works.
*  Because this, I mean, I don't know, maybe the one that you step on works.
*  Maybe but I'm skeptical of the one I got.
*  I'm not even going to say the name of it.
*  The one I ordered, I ordered three different ones because I wanted to see if they were
*  because we're all talking about doing it.
*  Ari's going to do it.
*  We're going to do a podcast.
*  We're all going to do a weight loss podcast because we look so fat and look, except Ari.
*  He looks good.
*  He wants to lose body fat and he has the bones of a baked chicken.
*  His bones just break.
*  Yeah.
*  And he found out he has inadequate bone mass and he's like, oh, okay, that's probably why
*  everything breaks when I ski because he's broken a bunch of shit skiing his arm and
*  his legs, ankle.
*  So he's going to gain some mass and hopefully become more of a man.
*  I mean, that's the ultimate goal going into this one.
*  His ski video is pretty amazing if that's him.
*  I think it's real.
*  He posted some video.
*  I don't know if it's real or deep fake.
*  Yeah, yeah, him skiing.
*  Oh, he can ski.
*  Yeah, he can ski pretty good.
*  He's like going on all the ramps and he's been skiing forever.
*  Ari's been skiing forever.
*  That's yeah.
*  He knows that pretty amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Bird's been doing push ups.
*  I kind of push ups.
*  What does that kind of push ups mean?
*  You either do or you don't like Yoda over here.
*  There's no want do or don't full extension, full extension push ups.
*  Not really.
*  He's not.
*  Well, those don't count.
*  You get zero points or get back down there.
*  It's a camera trick.
*  He's just bringing up a carpet.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's trying to lose weight too.
*  Yeah, we're all going to try to look impressive at the end of February.
*  That's the idea.
*  Is there a contest?
*  Are you figuring that out now?
*  Just doing it?
*  Just doing it's better.
*  The problem with contests is we all get crazy and we don't have time.
*  And the contest that's involved between Bert and Tom with just dance off videos is getting
*  pretty spectacular.
*  I know a few things.
*  I'm not telling nobody.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But there's some shit in the works.
*  It's going down.
*  Are we going to see you returning to like a?
*  No, no.
*  I'm not dancing.
*  I love that dancing scene.
*  No, no dancing.
*  No dancing.
*  You used a curtain swing across the room or something.
*  No, that was Kevin James.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's just hard on you, man.
*  It takes a lot of energy to learn how to dance in some stupid way that nobody gives a fuck
*  about.
*  Go big on TikTok.
*  You go crazy.
*  It's hard, man.
*  I'll tell you that.
*  I have a lot of respect for dancers.
*  It's fucking hard to do.
*  Very hard to do.
*  I mean, the just the physical motion required to move your body like that.
*  It's difficult.
*  Just I get it.
*  I don't like when people try to shame you into doing their thing either.
*  I don't like that.
*  You're too scared.
*  You're scared to do a dance off.
*  Fuck you.
*  All right.
*  Fuck you.
*  I'm not scared to do it.
*  No one's scared to do a dance off, man.
*  It doesn't matter if you dance better.
*  OK.
*  It's like out of all the things, it's one of this is not 1970 and this isn't Saturday
*  Night Fever.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  It's not a valuable commodity.
*  I know you wish it was.
*  I know you wish it was.
*  I know you wish in this day and age that being a great dancer was a valuable commodity.
*  But you know how I know it's not?
*  Because there's no rich, professional male dancers that are famous.
*  Name one.
*  The last one we have was Baryshnikov.
*  After that, that's it.
*  There's no more.
*  It's not like you will think about all the famous chefs we have.
*  Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain and the famous celebrity wealthy chefs are a dime
*  a dozen.
*  There's a lot of them today.
*  Guy Fieri.
*  You can keep going.
*  Wolfgang Puck.
*  You can keep going.
*  Right.
*  Name one.
*  Baller dancer.
*  Just dancer, though.
*  Just Michael Jackson.
*  There's people that are good at it.
*  No, he's Michael Jackson.
*  They do lots of stuff.
*  And he's dead.
*  Name one right now.
*  Savion Glover.
*  Who the fuck is that?
*  Tap dancer.
*  Listen, bro.
*  Keep it.
*  No disrespect to Mr. Glover.
*  No disrespect to anybody who bowls professionally.
*  Yeah, it's tough.
*  Just look.
*  You can't.
*  Nobody gives a fuck.
*  So if you try to pretend that it's a big deal, like it's not a big deal, that's why you can't
*  make a living doing it.
*  Well, I guess you can make a living dancing.
*  You certainly can make a living.
*  And if that's not the only reason, of course I'm joking.
*  It's not the only reason to be a very good dancer.
*  You should dance for love.
*  Dance for the love of your craft.
*  But if you try to shame someone into not having a dance off, they're going to go, hey, that
*  doesn't mean anything.
*  There's a lot of other interesting things you can do with your body.
*  You know, you can get good at a lot of different movements with your body.
*  I don't have to do a fucking hip hop dance off with you.
*  How about no?
*  Come on, man.
*  I want you to listen to some music you don't even like.
*  I don't want you to move in a way that's going to embarrass the fuck out of you five years
*  from now.
*  So go ahead, especially what Bert did or what Tom did to Bert.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That was kind of taking it too far.
*  It took it even further.
*  Because then he released a behind the scenes videos, a real reaction to Bird's video.
*  And they're not much better than the reactions that were in the fucking video where it was
*  acted out.
*  The real reactions hurt more because they're looking at them like they're like, what the
*  fuck?
*  Oh, oh, what the fuck is he doing?
*  That was real.
*  That's a real reaction.
*  Why is everyone trying to hurt Bert?
*  Because he's a really nice guy.
*  I'm not trying to hurt him.
*  I'm not like these fucks.
*  Ari's out there drugging him and Tom's pretending to stab him.
*  I'm just trying to get the guy to be healthy.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Joey Diaz dosed his dad.
*  I mean, everybody is.
*  Everybody's in on it.
*  It's not cool.
*  It's not cool.
*  He didn't deserve it.
*  Right?
*  No.
*  I don't think you deserve it.
*  I think he asked for it.
*  But it seems like that's part of the Bert Kreischer experience.
*  Right?
*  Part of the Bert Kreischer experience is like people step over.
*  They'd line step on him.
*  Don't you think?
*  A lot of people line step on Bert.
*  He gets very mad at it too.
*  Secretly mad.
*  Oh yeah.
*  People just taking their shirt off with them.
*  Well, not just that.
*  I mean, just what Ari did and what Tom did.
*  Those are two lines that are in the book.
*  Big time line steps.
*  Ari first took all his albums and I think he thought he broke them.
*  Remember?
*  That's right.
*  They threatened him on.
*  That's right.
*  Or Bert took them and then threatened them on Twitter.
*  That's right.
*  I forgot about that part.
*  Big suspension.
*  So Bert took the albums and then Ari threatened Bert.
*  Because he wouldn't give them back.
*  That's right.
*  Said he was going to kill them and then Twitter suspended him.
*  They had banned him and we had to show them some of the stuff that we had.
*  They had banned him and we had to show them somehow.
*  That it was a joke.
*  That it was a joke.
*  I think management got involved.
*  I remember there was a lot of people involved making emails and calls to Twitter trying
*  to explain.
*  These are best friends.
*  They're comedians.
*  But when you think about just having one of your best friends make a video of you, like
*  a deep fake, getting stabbed like Tom did.
*  I was like, yo.
*  What?
*  And it was realistic.
*  It wasn't like.
*  No, it was really rough.
*  Tom's all about the internet.
*  He knows what works.
*  He tricked him into giving him all the footage.
*  Giving him all the expressions.
*  Making all the facial expressions.
*  It's so ridiculous.
*  I asked Bert about it and he was like, you know how fucked up?
*  Like my daughter saw that.
*  Can you imagine seeing your dad being stabbed like that?
*  That should shame him in the losing weight.
*  So he doesn't look like that anymore.
*  Dude, I looked at myself when my gut was hanging out.
*  My love handles are hanging out.
*  That's as heavy as I've ever been.
*  And that's one of the reasons why I decided to do this carnivore thing.
*  Just try it.
*  Like I'm 205 pounds.
*  I'm supposed to be like 190.
*  I was like a legit 15 pounds overweight.
*  I can't cry.
*  I'm just lose this weight.
*  So now I'm down to like I think to this morning I was 197 or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I know.
*  Not good.
*  Right.
*  So I've lost eight pounds in just just two weeks.
*  I don't know how much of that's real though.
*  How much of that's water?
*  How much is that real?
*  How much can you really show him?
*  How much can you actually lose?
*  Like how much is real loss and how much of it is stuff that is going to change instantaneously the moment I change the way I'm eating?
*  Like is that right back?
*  Yeah.
*  Is it from carrying around water?
*  What is it?
*  I think most diets I noticed that like you can get seven up to seven pounds, eight pounds off almost immediately.
*  Right.
*  And that's changing your diet.
*  Yeah.
*  And a lot of like like sodium.
*  I'm just joking, but that's actually a huge thing.
*  Like a lot of people eat like noodles and ramen.
*  That's like your daily.
*  How much sodium you're supposed to have in like one half bowl.
*  So you're just retaining a lot of water.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people drink Gatorade a lot and stuff like that.
*  And you know, because they're hungover.
*  Oh, they get a bunch of that sodium that way.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there a healthy form of Gatorade?
*  See, someone told me that the thing that makes Gatorade really bad when you don't exercise makes it good if you do exercise.
*  Someone's explaining that Gatorade, like if you just want to drink Gatorade all day, it's kind of like almost like sugar.
*  Like you're just drinking sugar.
*  You're just drinking a soda.
*  But if you rigorously exercise, Gatorade is not a bad thing to have after you rigorously exercise.
*  Like this is a doctor who has a sort of famous workout web page and videos and he's very, very intelligent.
*  Jim Stopani is his name.
*  And he actually advocates people eating candy after they work out.
*  And just to immediately replenish the muscle glycogen levels.
*  And you can do that.
*  It's one time, even when you're cutting a lot of weight, when you have a brutal exercise, you actually can take in simple sugar very easily.
*  And it just helps your muscles sort of recover from a workout.
*  So that's when Gatorade is actually good.
*  So the thing that makes kids fat because they don't do anything, they just drink Gatorade and it just fucks them up because it's so much sugar.
*  That's actually good for you if you just ran a marathon or good for you if you're playing rugby.
*  Yeah, I wonder if like the G2s and the Powerade 0s, how bad they are for you.
*  I mean, they don't have zero calories.
*  Well, the zero calories is probably a problem.
*  Those are not good for you.
*  Probably as much.
*  They probably replenish the electrolytes, right?
*  Electrolytes don't have calories, but it's not just the electrolytes.
*  It's actually getting some sugar into your muscles that like that Jim Stopani guy.
*  Did you find him?
*  Yeah, I'm looking up a thing about eating gummy bears after you work out and for carbs and oh, Jim Stopani is interesting, too, because he's fucking fully tattooed up, including his head.
*  All of his head is, but he's a very smart guy.
*  Like, like you look at him and you go, I've been that guy's got his cock tattooed.
*  Not that I think about your cocks are.
*  I just got him everywhere.
*  But any super jacked.
*  Look at him.
*  See, that's what he used to look like.
*  Yeah, super jacked.
*  But now everything's covered, including like, look at that.
*  That's his neck and everything, his hands.
*  He's fucking too much.
*  He just looks black.
*  Shut up.
*  It's perfect.
*  You leave my boyfriend alone.
*  I go all kidding aside, I go to his Instagram page all the time.
*  It's very informational, very interesting videos to the house on YouTube.
*  He's clearly a very, very bright guy and is also super jacked.
*  Look at that.
*  So you see his neck, it goes all the way up to his chin.
*  Right.
*  But it's also super jacked.
*  It's craziness.
*  Yeah.
*  There he is.
*  That's him.
*  Anyway, enough of my boy crush.
*  So what else?
*  It's already three o'clock, man.
*  So listen, you and I were talking, we should commit to doing these more often.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  It's fun.
*  I love it.
*  Especially like I'm more looking forward to like silly ones nowadays because everything's
*  so goddamn interesting.
*  I mean, I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie.
*  Everything's so goddamn.
*  Even when we're talking about things, like if we're talking about something seriously,
*  at least we could fuck off while we're talking about something serious.
*  Yeah.
*  And I always get messages, especially after that 10 year video you guys posted, people
*  miss, like I think I was just talking about the internet and fucking around like this.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we were saying, like an internet show, a show where we just talk about like
*  what's going on on the internet this month?
*  What's happening right now?
*  Because there's so much, you'll never run out of disasters to cover.
*  You never.
*  All right.
*  You're going to be in Houston.
*  Is it sold out?
*  I think everything's sold out.
*  Sorry bitches.
*  Calgary soon.
*  Check out deathsquad.tv.
*  Is Calgary sold out as well?
*  I think that's just for last or something.
*  Maybe it might be sold out.
*  Oh, you know what people should check out?
*  I'm doing Holtzman's new podcast.
*  Oh, he has a podcast now?
*  If you like Brian Holtzman, I really have him on now.
