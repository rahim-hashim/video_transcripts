# Joe Rogan Experience #1543 - Brian Muraresku & Graham Hancock
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzAQ7SklDxo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Joined by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Joining us by Skype is the great and powerful Graham Hancock.
*  My friend, how are you, sir?
*  Hi, Joe.
*  It's really good to be back with you.
*  I wish I could be there in person.
*  It feels very strange to be on this technology, but these are the times we live in.
*  Yeah, well, I'm just happy we could talk at all in this day and age.
*  It's the little things like little victories.
*  And Brian, I'm going to try it.
*  I'm going to try it.
*  Mororescu.
*  You nailed it, bro.
*  Thank you.
*  And this is the first time we've ever done one of these as well in the studio.
*  Maybe ever.
*  Visual.
*  We've never done what we did one with you guys.
*  Remember, we did Randall Carlson.
*  Yeah.
*  Mark Defante came in by telephone.
*  Yes, which is very strange.
*  It was like a sound coming from nowhere.
*  At least I could see you.
*  But we've never done one of these like this.
*  But this book, tell me, this is The Immortality Key, the secret of the secret history of religion
*  of the religion with no name.
*  I'll say it again.
*  The secret history of the religion with no name.
*  Now, this is obviously when I found out the subject matter, Graham, this is right up your alley.
*  And it made total complete sense why you and Brian worked together on this.
*  So who wants to start and explain?
*  Why don't we, Graham, why don't we have you start since you're, you know, you're over there in the UK?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Well, I mean, for me, in fact, Joe, I think you and I originally got in touch because of my
*  interest in psychedelics in human culture and a book that I published in 2006 called Supernatural,
*  yes, which which looks at the huge role that psychedelics have played in cultures and in religions.
*  All around the world.
*  And I touched in that book on the role of psychedelics in the origins of Christianity,
*  which, of course, is a dynamite subject.
*  And what Brian has done in The Immortality Key has been to present hard and fast evidence that the
*  first Christians were using psychedelics and that their religious experiences were mediated by
*  psychedelic experiences.
*  And Brian, how did you get involved in this?
*  It's a long story.
*  You look like a stoner, by the way, I should tell you right now.
*  You look like a guy who's done a few mushrooms in his day.
*  Oddly enough, I don't do drugs and I've never done psychedelics.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to start?
*  Today?
*  Well, I wish we were in L.A.
*  I could hook you up.
*  In Texas, it's a little, the laws are sketchier here.
*  What what led you to do this then?
*  I was fascinated by Graham's work, which I only came across about 12 years ago.
*  I was a Latin, Greek and Sanskrit undergrad major.
*  And instead of getting the PhD or becoming a priest, which might the two options when you study
*  Latin and Greek, I went to law school instead for no reason whatsoever and then wound up at a law
*  firm. And a couple of years into it, started reading about these psilocybin studies coming out
*  of Hopkins and NYU.
*  And that amazing statistic that two thirds of the participants were describing it as one of the
*  most amazing experiences of their lives.
*  And it hit me that there was something there because the testimony coming out of Hopkins and NYU
*  in a very clinical setting immediately reminded me of what I heard about Eleusis.
*  And for those who don't know what Eleusis is, it's essentially the spiritual capital of the ancient
*  world. It was where the best and brightest of Athens and Rome went to essentially meet a goddess
*  in the flesh and have this mind blowing visionary experience.
*  So before Jerusalem, before Rome, before Mecca, there was Eleusis.
*  And for some reason, we're not taught about this in our high school mythology or Western civ classes.
*  But it was there that Plato, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius all went to drink a magical potion and in
*  their words have this vision, what Plato calls a blessed sight and vision, the holiest of
*  mysteries in which they claim to have a direct encounter with the goddess and completely
*  eradicate their fear of death.
*  It was very similar to what the volunteers are saying with their single experience of psilocybin.
*  Now with Eleusis, how much history do we have?
*  How much recorded history that documents these rituals?
*  And is there any that describes the actual contents of this mixture?
*  No, there isn't much. I mean, I say Eleusis is like the fight club of the ancient world.
*  The first rule about Eleusis is you don't talk about Eleusis.
*  All we have is this fragmentary testimony, again, from Plato, Pindarosophocles and others,
*  they do talk about a vision that's almost universal and they almost universally talk
*  about this once in a lifetime transformative event where they become initiates and only
*  they properly have life after death because at the time the Greeks didn't really look
*  forward to the afterlife.
*  In fact, there was no afterlife.
*  You just disappear into Hades to do God knows what.
*  But people walk away from Eleusis saying that they'd found salvation and we don't know why
*  or how. We know this potion is involved.
*  We know they make this pilgrimage 13 miles from Athens to Eleusis to drink this potion.
*  We know they they prepare for months, if not years before it, and they're forever changed
*  afterwards. But we have very little hard data to actually look into it.
*  And so in 1978, this this trio of renegades, Gordon Wasson, Albert Hoffman, who discovered
*  LSD, and Carl Ruck, who was then the chair of the Classics Department at Boston University,
*  they put out this book, The Road to Eleusis, claiming they'd found the secret after 2000
*  years of what they claimed is that this potion was actually spiked with ergot, which is that
*  naturally occurring fungus from which you can synthesize LSD.
*  And in fact, that's where Albert, that's how he synthesized LSD by accident in 1938 with
*  cultures of ergot.
*  We've talked about ergot before in this podcast, connecting it to the Salem witch trials, which
*  is very speculative, but they think there's real evidence that shows that there was a
*  late frost during the time of the Salem witch trials that probably led to mold growth on
*  their wheat, which probably led to ergot infestation of their food.
*  And so these poor people were, you know, unintentionally eating acid.
*  It happened a lot. There were ergot outbreaks across time, especially in the Middle
*  Ages. They would call it St. Anthony's fire, the ignis sacer, because it's so, so common.
*  In fact, if you talk to any brewer today, at least the brewers that I was talking to, I went to see
*  this beer scientist in Munich, Germany, Martin Zarnkow, and he says you can't avoid it.
*  Now, it's more common on things like rye, but it also pops up on barley and wheat, too.
*  And again, it's unavoidable and it's highly, highly toxic.
*  The question is, does it really produce the kind of vision, the visionary experiences that
*  people have on psilocybin, LSD, mescaline and others?
*  According to Albert Hoffman, absolutely.
*  So as a matter of fact, I went into the Harvard archives where Wasson's papers are kept to this
*  day in the Botany libraries, and I found a letter that Albert wrote Gordon, his co-author, in
*  1976, saying that Albert had self-experimented with with ergonavine, which is one of these
*  alkaloids in ergot. And he claimed in 1976, it was five to ten times more potent than
*  psilocybin.
*  Well, it's fascinating to me that these cultures seem to have hid some of these rituals.
*  And this goes back to really as far back as we have recorded psychedelic use, like
*  soma. We still to this day don't know what that is.
*  And it's described in these incredible ways in ancient Hindu texts, but we don't know what it
*  is.
*  We have an idea.
*  I actually brought some some Sanskrit to show you.
*  You want to see some Sanskrit?
*  Hell yeah.
*  Can you put it up on the screen?
*  It's under the soma tab.
*  Oh, look at how beautiful that is.
*  There it is.
*  Their language, writing it in Sanskrit.
*  God, it's so pretty.
*  Do you want me to read it for you?
*  Please. You can read that?
*  Yeah. So this was my major in college.
*  So in the very middle there, you can see
*  Imam Mindra Gavashira Yavashira Channa Pisha Akkathya Varshabhihi Sutama.
*  And what he's saying there is this is from the Rig Veda, right?
*  And it's the oldest literature in Western civilization.
*  Among the Indo-European languages, it's the oldest recorded literature that we have.
*  It could be 1500 BC, 1700, perhaps much earlier, like the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greek.
*  This is the mother tongue of all the Indo-European languages.
*  And what they write about a lot is soma, which is both a god and the juice that is pressed from this
*  god. And what they're talking about there is making this ritual potion, very much like the
*  kukyan that we find among the ancient Greeks. And here soma is described as a mixed potion.
*  Yavashira means mixed with barley.
*  Gavashira from Sanskrit go, gava is milk, mixed with milk.
*  And so I've read all the theories that you have about what soma was,
*  whether it was the Amanita muscaria mushroom or some psilocybin-containing species or DMT.
*  The way that they describe soma here is always a mixed potion, which so in this case,
*  mixed with barley and milk.
*  So that would be an ergot, some sort of...
*  Already they're mentioned. And so that's what Rock Hoffman and Wossum were saying in 1978.
*  We have literature from the 7th century BC, it's called the Hymn to Demeter,
*  where they record these ingredients of what the kukyan was. You ask, like,
*  where's the actual evidence? So in the 70s, we didn't have much. It starts with the literature,
*  which is what classicists do. And so there's this Hymn to Demeter that was discovered in 1777,
*  a year after we declare our independence from Graham's people.
*  And what they found in there in line... Sorry, Graham.
*  We're in Texas, man.
*  Absolutely. Well done. I'm all for independence.
*  I'd like to be independent of my own country, if possible as well.
*  Well, Texas has taken refugees at the moment, has it not?
*  Well, that's what's happening here. That's why we're here. We're refugees from the
*  country of California. The nation state of California. So why do we know why they
*  combined it with milk? Was it just so that it was easier to consume?
*  That's what we don't know. We don't know why the kukyan was this mixed thing either.
*  But so in the Hymn to Demeter, they record these ingredients. It's alfi, which is barley,
*  which is water, and which means mint. And that's all we had.
*  So it doesn't say milk? You didn't say milk?
*  That was in soma.
*  In soma? Oh, I'm sorry.
*  Which they mix with all kinds of things. And not just barley and milk, but also honey.
*  As a matter of fact, soma is often identified with madhu, which is honey in Sanskrit.
*  McKenna speculated that there was a transfer in culture of a psychedelic-based culture to
*  an alcohol-based culture based on climate change and also based on preserving things in honey.
*  And that honey would create mead. And mead, which if people don't know,
*  is an alcohol beverage that's actually made with honey.
*  Do you think that this was the case with the use of honey as well? That it's used as a
*  preservative? Or was it used to make it taste better, more palatable?
*  We don't know. That's the problem when we're talking about ancient plants and fungi.
*  Plants especially. We don't know what plants they're talking about.
*  So the ancient literature records all kinds of plants across the language.
*  If I could jump in, Joe, you're absolutely right. There was secrecy that surrounded the
*  use of these potions in the ancient world. There's a case from Athens of the potion
*  from Eleusis being used for recreational purposes. And this is roundly condemned
*  by all concerned that it should only be used for the sacred and spiritual purposes of which it
*  was intended. So there was a great deal of secrecy that surrounded the use of these potions.
*  And the potions were a doorway or a gateway into another level of reality.
*  And what's fascinating from Eleusis and many other ancient accounts is the way that people
*  come back having lost their fear of death. That they don't regard death as the end anymore.
*  It's just another stage on the journey, just the beginning of the next great adventure.
*  Brian is absolutely right to draw attention to the modern work with psilocybin. And again,
*  we find people who are terminal cases who are imminently facing death, losing their fear of
*  death as a result of using psilocybin. So we can begin to see connections between what we understand
*  about these extraordinary substances in the modern world and how the ancient world used them.
*  That does seem to be a universal theme. This theme of alleviating the fear of death.
*  And this comes up constantly with people that I know personally that have had these psychedelic
*  experiences. They say, well, I feel like I went to heaven or I feel like now I understand why
*  people believe there's this perfect afterlife that I've experienced.
*  A lot of the critics will say that it's some kind of natural human tendency that we don't want to die
*  and that we're afraid of death and that religions provide us with some sort of solace,
*  some sort of feeling of security. But I don't think that washes at all. I think what's striking
*  about the psychedelics is it's a direct experience that the person has. They have an experience.
*  It's not a teaching. It's not something that they're told about. It's not a scripture that
*  they read. It's an experience that they have. And that experience eliminates the fear of death.
*  I think Brian, by the way, having written the immortality key, for which I've only provided
*  the forward, I think Brian is absolutely right to be a psychedelic virgin. In my case, because I
*  have used psychedelics and many other substances, a lot of my critics just try to write off all my
*  work, whether it's on lost civilizations or on psychedelics. They try to write it all off as the
*  rantings of a sort of drug-fueled maniac. And I think it's very smart of Brian, very smart of Brian
*  not to put himself in that situation. I hope he will work with psychedelics in the future,
*  but I think he was right not to work with psychedelics before writing this book and
*  to concentrate on the evidence. Well, Michael Pollan, who later in life experienced psychedelics
*  and wrote pretty brilliantly about them, for me, he's one of the more interesting people to discuss
*  it because Michael's an investigative journalist. He takes deep dives into these subjects and his
*  deep dive into psychedelics was incredibly illuminating. And so for him, I really enjoyed
*  talking to him about it and I really enjoyed his book as well. His perceptions of it were really
*  unique because you're talking about a guy who lived his whole life without them, and then really
*  dove head first for his book. It's kind of what happened to me when I wrote Supernatural.
*  Apart from one experience with LSD in 1974, I hadn't used any psychedelics until I began to
*  research Supernatural back in the early 2000s. And because I'm a kind of boots on the ground
*  researcher, I felt it was essential that I have these experiences. What I couldn't guess was the
*  way that the experiences would utterly change and transform my life. And I can understand from a
*  level of personal experience why psychedelics do lie at the root, I think, of all the world's
*  religions. And those religions are now busily at work trying to deny that connection. Well,
*  they're not just trying to do it. There's many people in science that are trying to deny these
*  connections too. And it's so unfortunate that the people that are trying to deny these connections
*  or the significance of these experiences haven't had them. I don't think anybody who has a dimethyltryptamine
*  experience can just dismiss it as being no big deal. It's too crazy. You need to do it, sir.
*  This guy. Just the fact that it's one of those things where everyone who does it comes out of
*  it saying, I can't believe that's real. I can't believe you can just get there that quickly, that
*  three puffs and all of a sudden you're in Narnia. I just can't. We're not way more intense than Narnia.
*  You're in Narnia and you're in a place where entities are actually communicating with you
*  and speaking to you and teaching to you. I mean, this is another aspect of psychedelics, is the
*  moral aspect of psychedelics. Critics and enemies of psychedelics want to associate them with some
*  kind of immorality. But actually anybody who's worked extensively with psychedelics will know
*  that they contain moral teachings. Whether it's the mushrooms or whether it's LSD, they cause us
*  to examine our own behavior, our own impact upon others, to question our unkindness to others,
*  and to give us at least the push to begin to be better people and more nurturing and more caring
*  people for others. So this strong moral element in psychedelics again is totally ignored by the
*  critics who just want to demonize these substances for reasons that I think are rather sinister,
*  actually. I think our current culture lacks a map of the territory. If we had
*  some sort of legitimate psychedelic counseling where we could go somewhere and experts both in
*  pharmacology and in medical science can talk people through these experiences and help them,
*  achieve them, and get people to realize that much like the ancients, these experiences are not,
*  it's not wise to use them recreationally. I mean, you can if you want. I mean, many people have and
*  then inadvertently benefited from them greatly. But I think they're very profound and I think
*  they should be treated like, almost like you've got a Willy Wonka golden ticket to go meet God,
*  because that's what it seems like. It's what it seems like is happening.
*  It was for the ancients.
*  It should be treated with respect. It should be treated with respect and with reverence,
*  because of this sense that we're passing through a doorway into a seamlessly convincing parallel
*  reality and the possibility that that isn't just a concoction of our brains, that the brains are
*  simply acting as an interface or a transceiver between us and that other level of reality.
*  And again, you can see the connection with psychedelics and religion here. My view is,
*  and I've said this before on your show, Joe, if I were running the world, anybody who wanted to be
*  a president, a prime minister, a head of state of any kind, I think it should be obligatory that
*  they have at least a dozen sessions with a powerful psychedelic. It can be DMT, it can be Ayahuasca,
*  it can be LSD, but they got to go through those dozen sessions. They should be guided by experienced
*  practitioners. And at the end of those dozen sessions, I very much doubt if those individuals
*  would be the same individuals who went into the application for the job in the first place.
*  I don't think you could be the same. When you write about all this, how curious are you
*  personally of the experience and do you plan on having it?
*  I do, under the conditions that you set. I mean, I think that we're in a period now where everything
*  is about to change. The clinical research is advancing. Rick Dolvin is moving to phase three.
*  You have researchers at Hopkins, NYU, now UCLA, looking at psilocybin for a host of different
*  conditions, from depression, anxiety, end of life distress, which is really fascinating.
*  And I think that sometime over the next five years, the FDA is going to get involved and these will
*  become available, at least for specified conditions. And what I look forward to is maybe in 10 years
*  time or less, these retreat centers, which are licensed and regulated with professional staff
*  and medical supervised staff who essentially guide people through what would be a novel
*  initiation experience, not unlike what may have happened 2,700 years ago.
*  I'm hoping they're going to be backdoored in as therapy for people with pre-existing conditions
*  that we have right now, like opioid addiction, iboga, like Ibogaine being introduced, and MDMA
*  for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, for soldiers, because there's been so much
*  real solid evidence that it's incredibly beneficial to these people, particularly
*  the opioid crisis. I mean, we have a real problem in this country with people being addicted to
*  these pills and then wind up dying from them. That can be nipped in the bud, like really
*  effectively with Ibogaine. And the fact that you have to leave the country to have these Ibogaine
*  experiences is really, it's a terrible statement on the rational thinking of our culture today,
*  because it's not like these are unknown things. We're talking about it right now in a podcast
*  that millions of people are listening to. And we've talked about it dozens of times in the past.
*  And it's something that scientists are aware of, researchers are aware of,
*  and particularly people who have come back from there and have had these experiences and have been
*  cured of their addictions. It literally rewires the way the brain interfaces with these opioids.
*  And the fact that it's not available to people and they have to go through traditional counseling and
*  just benefit from their willpower and somehow or another try not to relapse. It's terrible.
*  We're even just mitigating some of that. I mean, even cannabis, for example, which can
*  mitigate some of those addictive potentials. I worked with athletes, for example, which might
*  interest you. So I represented a guy named Mike James, who was an NFL player, who we believe is
*  the first professional athlete in the US to seek a therapeutic use exemption from the NFL, to get
*  off his opioids and use cannabis instead. And we were there at 51st and Park Avenue at NFL headquarters
*  arbitrating with the NFL to try and get him a cannabis supply. And he lost and he was fined
*  six figures in the process and he left the league because of it. He's not the first one, right?
*  Wasn't there was a, who's the other Jamie, you're a football fan. Who's the other famous football
*  player who couldn't kick the weed? Ricky Williams. That's right. Ricky Williams. He never saw a
*  TUE though. It was unthinkable to get a TUE at the time. But it's amazing that the NFL would have
*  a problem with marijuana when so many of those guys are on pills. I mean, some of those guys are
*  so severely injured. I mean, it is one of the most brutal, if not the most brutal sport in the world.
*  And the fact that these guys can't seek marijuana for relief when they allow them to take opioids,
*  it's just bananas. It doesn't make any sense. Because we live in an insane society.
*  Which has got all its priorities upside down and is completely screwing up this beautiful
*  world that human beings have been gifted by the universe. And I think it boils down to
*  relatively few people. We just have incredibly bad governments, lousy leaders, totally irresponsible,
*  lacking any initiative or imagination in it entirely for themselves. It's a messed up world
*  and it's a kind of litmus test for how messed up that world is. That sovereign adults cannot take
*  the responsible decision to use psychedelics without risking jail. It's very, very insane
*  that that should be the case. And yet alcohol is glorified in our society. As you say, the opioids
*  are prescribed hand over fist by big pharma. We're very mixed up. And I have a feeling that
*  the sooner we get our politicians onto major psychedelics, the better things are going to be.
*  Well, I think we've got to get the whole world involved as well.
*  We don't want to be the only ones that are tripping. No problem. If the Chinese and the
*  Russians are not tripping and we are, we're like, everything's going to be fine, man.
*  Yeah. And also the other point to make, again, the critics try to trivialize this.
*  But actually working with psychedelics, it can be really hard work. It can be really grueling. It
*  can be really demanding. It can put you through the psychological wringer as you confront your
*  own dark side and learn how to deal with it. Yes, there is a recreational role for these
*  substances. And I honor the right of sovereign adults to use them for recreational purposes
*  if they wish to do so. But it's the deep work that these psychedelics require us to do,
*  which is really fascinating and which is not easy. It's very, very, very difficult. I personally
*  find it difficult. I don't rush to my next psychedelic adventure. I prepare myself very,
*  very carefully and with some experience. And those experiences, whether they're real or not,
*  experiences that impact you as the experience does.
*  Yeah. You were breaking up a little bit there, but yeah, I completely agree with you about that.
*  I get terrified when I take an edible. A marijuana edible is the introspective nature of those things
*  and the way it breaks down your thoughts and your behavior and finds the skeletons in your closet.
*  You're in that for six hours.
*  Searching around with a flashlight. I tell people though, but that's one of the things that I like
*  about it. I learn things. I know it's scary. I know I feel terrifying while it's happening.
*  But when I come out of it on the other end, I genuinely feel like I'm a better person.
*  I've gone at that moment. I will be nicer to you. I'm better at being me. It's very effective. It
*  really works. There's something to it and it's available. It's not something that you have to
*  go to counseling for years and years and it's right there. You can get it real quick.
*  This was the whole point of the mysteries by the way in the ancient world. So there was a whole
*  apparatus dedicated to curating these experiences for people. Sometimes it was once in a lifetime
*  like at Eleusis at some later point in your life. Then you have the Dinesian mysteries which are a
*  bit weirder and a bit crazier. But they were also curated by professionals, by technicians,
*  women in this case who were thought to be spiking wine with all kinds of magical plants,
*  herbs and fungi. But the mysteries existed to create this experience of death and rebirth.
*  They're supposed to be terrifying. You were supposed to enter the underworld to meet the
*  goddess. It doesn't happen in the daylight. It doesn't happen prancing around. The Greeks are
*  known for lots of great things that we've inherited like democracy and the arts and the sciences.
*  What we're doing right now, this this three logos through these microphones, these are all
*  Greek things and Greek technology that we've accepted as part and parcel of Western civilization.
*  But there was another part to them and it's a part again that is not taught in high school
*  mythology or Western civ. There's this deeply mystical aspect in the mysteries for example,
*  which the Greeks really looked to as something that wasn't just like a special part of civilization
*  but the the central part of it. So there is this, I'll tell you a story about this fourth century
*  historian Zosimus. He records the testimony of a Roman guy named Praetekstatus who was initiated
*  at Eleusis. Because remember it wasn't just people from Greece. It was around the Greek Empire
*  including at that time were people who'd been influenced by the Greeks. And Eleusis has survived
*  up until the fourth century AD at which point it is destroyed. It's eliminated by the Christianized
*  by Christians. Yeah by the Christianized Roman Empire in the late fourth century. And so there
*  were different attempts to wipe it off the map and in 364 the emperor Valentinian, he essentially
*  outlaws all nocturnal celebrations because these things are always at night. Eleusis was at night
*  which speaks to part of the experience. And this guy Praetekstatus is recorded as saying,
*  Valentinian, please don't shut this down. I'm an initiate. I've been to Eleusis. I've drunk the
*  potion. I've seen the goddess. Please do not eliminate this. Eleusis is the one thing that
*  holds the entire human race together, he said. He said if you get rid of Eleusis, life for us will
*  become a biotos, which in Greek means unlivable. It wasn't just about Greek existence. It was about
*  human existence. There was something happening at Eleusis with that potion, with this beatific
*  vision that literally held civilization together like glue for the ancient Greeks and democracy,
*  the arts, the sciences, everything else was an offshoot of that experience. Eleusis was the
*  foundation. One of the things you talked about was that there was this transference like the
*  Eucharist eventually became a placebo. What do you think it was initially? Do you think it was a
*  psychedelic mushroom? Allegro certainly thought that, right? Right. John Mark Allegro, author of
*  the sacred mushroom and the scroll. He releases that book in 1970 and he claims that Christianity
*  is the guise for a Near Eastern fertility cult. I think it's very interesting, but there aren't
*  many linguists who support the proposition. Right. There's a lot of people that disagree
*  with him pretty heavily, right? I mean, from like a purely linguistic perspective, to explain it
*  briefly. Did you read the sacred mushroom and the cross? Do you read it? Several times. Did you read
*  the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth as well? From Allegro. Yeah. That's the one that was...
*  So the Catholic Church bought out the original one, right? It was very difficult to get a hold
*  of for the longest time. You had to buy copies of it. I've heard rumors to that effect. Yeah.
*  And then he comes out with the second book, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth.
*  Knowing as much as you know about language, did you feel like he made leaps? Did you feel like
*  he made these connections that maybe were based on speculation? So he writes, it's pure philology,
*  right? So it's word games and things that only linguists... I mean, I think it's incredible that
*  people who aren't linguists can actually read that. It's really, really difficult to read
*  sacred mushroom and the cross. But the basic premise is that the New Testament, written in
*  Greek, has this Semitic substratum. So underneath the Greek, the author, the Gospel writers and Paul
*  are actually referring to different terms in Hebrew or Aramaic. And that these terms have in turn come
*  from the Sumerian, which any linguist would say is a language isolate. That there is no real relationship
*  between Sumerian and the Indo-European languages like Greek and the Semitic. So the premise of the
*  argument is something that most linguists don't accept. However, and Carl Ruck has written the
*  afterword to one of the editions you probably have of Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. And he gets into
*  some complex theories about psycholinguistics and this interesting idea that just because they
*  aren't related, there are certain words, certain names, certain vocabulary, like plant definitions,
*  which would carry across the different languages. And I find that somewhat interesting. But when you
*  dig into the words that Allegro was recreating, he places an asterisk actually next to these words
*  because they can't be corroborated by the ancient texts. So some of these Sumerian words, he straight
*  up hypothesizes as existing. They can't really be found in the existing tablets. So it's hard to
*  correlate some of those meanings he draws down from the Sumerian. But that said, he makes very
*  interesting claims. For example, like in 1 Corinthians 22, there's this interesting line
*  where he says about the, we preach Christ crucified, is a scandalon for the Jews and a folly for the
*  Greeks. And scandalon in Greek means like a bolt or a snare, like a trap. And Allegro ties it to like a
*  tickla in Aramaic, which is like what he calls the bolt mushroom. And in Sumerian,
*  and so he's saying that Paul's actually telling the Jews that the Christ crucified is a mushroom
*  instead of a scandalon. It's like a code word, like the scandalon is a mushroom. And then for the
*  Greeks, he says it's a folly, which is moira in Greek, which actually means mandrake, which is
*  another psychedelic plant. So there's all this different wordplay going on, but it's really
*  hard to tease out any physical forensic evidence for this stuff, which was what I went after.
*  Was Allegro's position, if I recall correctly, that the sacred mushroom was Amanita Muscaria?
*  Yeah, that was even the cover of his book, it was a photo of Amanita Muscaria.
*  And that's where I have a, I think Allegro did amazing work, but that's one area where I have
*  a problem with Amanita Muscaria as the psychedelic of choice in early Christianity. Because
*  in shamanic cultures where Amanita Muscaria is used, it's recognized that the
*  potion, that the mushroom is much more effective after it's been passed through a human body,
*  or indeed through the body of a reindeer, and emerged in urine. And so those shamanistic
*  cultures of Siberia use Amanita Muscaria by drinking it in the urine of a shaman
*  who has previously consumed the mushroom. And I don't see a lot of evidence for that
*  in early Christianity. And it's why I like the work that Brian has done, looking at the
*  really hard evidence for psychedelics in early Christianity, which are not in this case,
*  Amanita Muscaria, if I'm correct, Brian. Isn't the speculation about Amanita Muscaria that it's
*  seasonable? It's seasonal. It's also genetically variable. There's different species of,
*  much like different fruits taste differently, there's different versions of the Amanita Muscaria
*  that have more psychedelic compounds in them. And then there's all sorts of ways of preparing them
*  that we've completely lost. Am I getting this wrong? Because I've only had one
*  Amanita Muscaria experience and it wasn't very convincing.
*  Yeah. And this is often the case, but I'm told, I've not had the experience myself,
*  but I'm told that if you can bear the idea of drinking the shaman's urine after he or she has
*  consumed the Amanita Muscaria, you will have a really powerful journey.
*  Yeah, but you don't want a shaman just laughing hysterically after you drink his urine.
*  Absolutely.
*  The joke's on you, stupid. Yeah. There's also so many correlations between the Amanita Muscaria
*  and Santa Claus and Santa Claus to shamans. The colors, the red and white.
*  Also the bag, the toys, the fact that they would dry them on these coniferous trees,
*  the fact that these mushrooms have this Michael Rizzo relationship with coniferous trees,
*  where they tend to grow under pine trees, which is the tree that we use for Christmas trees.
*  The fact that they're bright red, like a toy that is in a package waiting for a child to
*  open it up. There's so many of these weird connections. The colors, the fact that reindeer
*  are with Santa Claus, the fact these reindeer fly.
*  They fly through the heavens.
*  Yeah. I mean, that caribou are notoriously attracted to Amanita Muscaria mushrooms. In fact,
*  people that have had psychedelic rituals and gone outside to urinate have talked about caribou
*  knocking them over to try to get to their urine. Caribou are reindeer.
*  Yeah.
*  They have been observed eating these things. They have this weird relationship. All those things
*  are together, connected in some sort of a strange way. There's also a history of shamonic rituals
*  being outlawed in Siberia. The way they got around it was they would come through the chimney,
*  which is just crazy. They would climb onto people's roofs and slide down the chimney to
*  deliver the mushrooms.
*  It's just another example of the way that our culture takes an ancient historical truth and
*  completely castrates it and turns it into Santa Claus. Whereas what we're actually dealing with
*  are profound experiences in deeply altered states of consciousness.
*  Well, it's also this information seems to have been lost fairly recently because if you go back
*  to the early 1950s and 40s and look at Christmas cards, the Christmas cards and depictions of
*  Christmas almost always contained elves and Amanita Muscaria mushrooms. The Amanita Muscaria
*  mushroom was synonymous with Christmas for some strange reason. Have you seen those old?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's crazy, right? What is that?
*  It's all over the fairy tale books too. You can't avoid the Amanita everywhere you look,
*  which is why I think Allegro was also interested writing in 1970 and studying it in the 50s and
*  60s. I think that's why he glommed onto the Amanita.
*  But it's such an unconvincing mushroom. The people that I know that have experienced it
*  in terms of a psychedelic ritual, it's just I don't know anybody who's really blown their
*  brains out with it.
*  No, and Gordon Wasson also thought it was the ingredient behind soma as well. He writes a book
*  about this in 1968, Soma, Divine Mushroom of Immortality. That was his guess too for soma.
*  But Wasson was experienced with psilocybin, which is so universally regarded as being effective.
*  That's why it's so confusing.
*  I always found that strange too, to be honest. So Wasson, I mean to explain where this comes from,
*  Wasson has this incredible experience with Maria Sabina in 1955 in Oaxaca, Mexico.
*  And when he consumes the, we think psilocybin mexicana, and he is catapulted to the heavens,
*  and he has this vision that he describes as the realest thing he's ever experienced
*  under the influence of the psilocybin.
*  And the thought occurs to him, he writes later in 1957 in Life Magazine.
*  He says that, could it be the case that the divine mushrooms are in fact the answer behind
*  the ancient mysteries? Which is why he then went and started looking at the Amanita perhaps,
*  or eventually Urgot, which is where I pick up the scent.
*  At some point in his correspondence with Albert Hofmann, they together began focusing on Urgot,
*  like we said, because it's so common and so natural, but so highly toxic too.
*  And Albert claimed to have this experience with it, and so for years and years,
*  after teaming up with Karl Ruck, they were convinced that Urgot had to somehow be involved.
*  So what is the speculation of what the Eucharist originally was?
*  According to the early Gnostics?
*  Yeah, I mean, is there any text that explains what the initial food was?
*  Well, I mean, we have the canonical explanation from the Gospels, and we have St. Paul's letter.
*  I mean, the honest answer, and I think any priest would say this too, is the honest answer is we
*  don't know. You know, the Gospels are written anytime between 65 and 100 AD. Paul's letters
*  are some of the earliest writings that we have, like the letter to the Corinthians, for example.
*  He writes that in about 53 AD, and the way he describes what's happening there is very,
*  very interesting. Maybe we can pull it up, actually. I brought some of the Greek from
*  the New Corinthians. It's under Christian Pharmacon and the 4 Corinthians 1130.
*  So at some point, I was looking for what that original Eucharist was, and where it was taken.
*  You have to think about the Greek world at this time. Jesus is born in the Holy Land,
*  but Christianity really takes root in the Greek-speaking parts of the empire,
*  which is why Paul's letters are written to Greek-speaking people.
*  Why it's interesting to follow this theory is because you have the ancient Greek-speaking
*  Greek in the pagan world, but you also have ancient Greek-speaking Greek in this Christianizing world.
*  The people in Corinth is this church not far from Eleusis, by the way. In fact, today it's only an
*  hour west of Eleusis, and one of the earliest churches is there, and Paul is addressing this
*  early church in Greek. You can read the English, but he's essentially yelling at them for consuming
*  the wrong kind of Eucharist. Earlier in this chapter, he calls it a cup of demons, and at the
*  end he says, that's why so many of you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
*  And I highlighted the word koimontai there. So koimaō in Greek, I can tell you for certain,
*  does not mean to fall asleep. Koimaō means to die, because it's the exact word that John's
*  Gospel uses about Lazarus. Remember the famous miracle where Lazarus dies and he's resurrected?
*  That'd be a pretty shitty miracle if Lazarus was just taking a nap and Jesus went to wake him up
*  from a nap. And he uses the same verb there. What Paul is saying here is that he's concerned
*  that so many Corinthians are drinking a wine that is causing them to die. Why would wine cause you
*  to die in a Greek world that had no distilled liquor? There was no hard alcohol in ancient
*  Greece. Distilled liquor doesn't enter Europe until much, much later, 8th, 9th, 10th centuries AD.
*  At this time, there's no word for alcohol either. Alcohol is Arabic, if you listen to the word,
*  like alchemy or algebra or alcove, all these al words all come from the Arabic. Al is like the
*  article in Arabic, like el in Spanish or il in Italian. So at this point, wine is not known
*  for its alcoholic content. Wine is a potion that is routinely mixed with all kinds of stuff,
*  toxins, spices, perfumes, and plants, herbs, and fungi. And here we don't know what to make of it,
*  but the Corinthians are drinking something that's causing them to die. But the word is die.
*  Coimao absolutely means to die because it's the word that, in fact, you can go to the next slide,
*  Jamie. It's the, if you look it up right there, it means just like we would say the sleep of death,
*  but it means death. And elsewhere in the gospels, it's the exact word used for what happened to
*  Lazarus before his miraculous resurrection. It's the whole point of the miracle. He is Coimao. He
*  has fallen asleep to the death of sleep. Whoa. So the speculation is that there's some sort of
*  a psychedelic or a fungi or something that's in the wine that's causing them to die and they're
*  using it recreationally and they're trying to discourage this. That's how I read it. And it's
*  not just based on a random read of this one line in Corinthians. It's based on an understanding of
*  what Greek wine actually was, how far back it goes, which is centuries and centuries before this,
*  how it was mixed, what it was mixed with. Even in the first century, there's a guy called
*  Dioscorides, a Greek pharmacologist. In fact, he's called the father of drugs. And at the same time
*  that these gospels and Paul's letters are being written, he writes something called the Materia
*  Medica. It's these five books in Greek and every drug prescription you've ever had in your life
*  exists because Dioscorides wrote that manuscript. And in that manuscript, in book five, he lists out
*  in book five alone, 56 different recipes for spiked wine. And in the Greek, he shows you how
*  to spike wine with everything from salvia to hellebore to henbane, which he says is good for
*  swollen genitals. So if you have swollen genitals, you dissolve henbane into wine. He says if you
*  drink mandrake wine, like Allegro was talking about mandrake, it'll kill you in one cupful.
*  And then he says this about black nightshade in book 474. He says if you dissolve nightshade into
*  wine, it will produce phantasias ou aeidaeis, which in Greek means not unpleasant visions.
*  So just from the literature, we can tell that the Greeks absolutely knew how to spike wine
*  with very powerful substances. Graham, I gotta tell you, your microphone is really sensitive.
*  So anytime you do anything, any movement or breathing, it bangs around for whatever reason.
*  I'm sorry. I just have to make you aware of it. So I have to sit still. No, everything's fine. But
*  anytime you bat, it's just really it overpowers everything. Unfortunately. Sorry. Can I be turned
*  down at the switchboard or something? I don't know. I don't think that's what it is. I think
*  it's the type of recording that says Jamie, Jamie will clean it up. I'm writing him down.
*  It's okay. He's writing down all the noises. That's how good Jamie is. I wanted to bring up
*  sage to you because one of the things that you talked about was salvia. Salvia is sage, right?
*  They are basically in the same species, at least when those priests would be walking down the aisle
*  and they would be blowing sage, they burning sage. Was that for some sort of a psychedelic
*  effect? Is that the reason why they were doing that? So when it comes to incense, we actually
*  have an answer now. I'm not sure if you know this, but earlier this year in May, there were some
*  researchers in Israel who released one of the first archeochemical studies of ancient incense.
*  Have you heard about this? No. So just in May, at a place called Tel Arad in Israel, south of
*  Jerusalem, west of the Dead Sea, there was the organic remains of some kind of incense that was
*  burned on these two altars that is described by the researchers as kind of a scaled down version
*  of Solomon's temple. It's dated to the eighth century BC, so in the Judahite period. So we could
*  feasibly say the beginnings of the Judeo-Christian period. Oh yeah, there it is.
*  Frankincense, I love that word. So under archeochemical analysis, and this sample had
*  actually been excavated years ago in the 1960s and was deposited in the museum, but the thing with
*  this science, which is amazing, is that they can resurrect this stuff no matter when it was
*  excavated. So fortunately it wasn't contaminated and after analysis they found it contained THC,
*  CBD, and CBN. So tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol. And so they say it's the first
*  example of psychoactive drug use in the ancient Holy Land essentially. So when they were walking
*  down the aisle, would they use only, we know that was cannabis, but sage was used as well, right?
*  And sage is salvia divinorum, which is a more potent psychedelic than cannabis. Yeah, but I think
*  that's a new world plant though, if I'm not mistaken. I mean at least the one you're thinking
*  of. So when you say new world, you're talking about European world? In the Americas. Oh,
*  Americas, really? So sage use when they would have it in that, what is that, Graham, you would know
*  this, what is that thing that they walk down the aisle with when they blow that smoke? A sensor.
*  That's really what it's called? A sensor? C-E-N-S-O-R. Yeah, a sensor. It's an interesting
*  double entendre there. Yeah. Sensor ship, yeah. So they were most certainly using cannabis or
*  something else that they were burning and they were getting everybody high. And frankincense.
*  Yeah, and what is frankincense? It's an aromatic spice. So it just smells nice. We don't think
*  it's psychoactive, but maybe at the right dose it could be. But the cannabis certainly was. So they
*  would give everybody marijuana smoke, just walk down the aisle and blow marijuana smoke on everybody.
*  If I may add, whether or not the smoke is psychedelic, it is adding to the experience,
*  it's adding to the setting. And again, anybody who's worked with psychedelics will know that
*  the setting is at least as important as the substance itself. So they're masters of creating
*  this mysterious and powerful and energizing setting in which the psychedelic experience
*  can then unfold. It's such a bummer that we know so little about what exactly was going on,
*  but so nice that someone like you has done these deep dives into it, where at least we could
*  pull out whatever we can. And it just makes me think, where would we be if people like you
*  weren't doing this? It's so rare. This is why I'm not doing DMT, man.
*  Because you wouldn't be doing it. I don't know, you might be doing it with more
*  feverish need. I mean, you might be really obsessed with it. It's so strange. And Graham,
*  I always go back to your statement, which I think is such a great quote, that we're a species with
*  amnesia in regard to our archaeology, our history, but also in regard to our use of psychedelics.
*  Yeah. Well, we've just not been given the straight scoop about our past. Sometimes it's just purely
*  the way that scholars work, that academics work. And sometimes I think in the case of Christianity,
*  it is actually a kind of conspiracy. I think there was a deliberate effort to cover up
*  the role of psychedelics. And you could see why priests in the developing Roman Catholic faith,
*  who've already pulled on the jackboot of the Roman Empire, you could see why they wouldn't like
*  their congregations using psychedelics. Because when you use psychedelics, you have a direct
*  experience of the divine and hey, you don't need that priest anymore. The priest as an intermediary
*  between you and the divine becomes redundant. And I think that there was a concerted effort
*  to cover up the role of psychedelics in early Christianity and to present a different narrative,
*  which it was purely was the bread and the wine, the blood and the body of Christ in a symbolic
*  sense and not in an actual sense of a substance that connects us to the divine. So the literature
*  that connects the banning of these psychedelic rituals in fourth century, you're saying,
*  how does it describe it? And what was the reaction by the people?
*  I mean, at the time, so you have to remember that the Greek mysteries existed for a long,
*  long time. We don't know exactly how long, but the excavators and this began in Eleusis,
*  for example, in 1887, they date it back to at least 1500 BC. So if it survives until the
*  fourth century AD, you're talking almost 2000 years, as long as Christianity itself has been
*  around. And the mysteries themselves, and there are serious scholars who came along in the 70s
*  to say this, could have prehistoric roots, which is how I started the investigation,
*  by asking how this actually got to the Greeks. Because what's interesting about this Koukian
*  potion, for example, is that it's not wine based. In that hymn to Demeter that came down to us,
*  she's actually offered wine in this mythical story that takes place. She's out looking for
*  her daughter Persephone, who's been abducted and kidnapped to the underworld. And she looks for her
*  for nine days and nights and can't find her. And she rests her bones exhausted at Eleusis,
*  and they try to offer her wine. And she says, no, she wants that water, barley and mint.
*  And again, Hoffman, Wasson and Rock thought it was kind of like a primitive version of beer,
*  if you think about it. It reads like a very simple beer recipe. Now for the Greeks, all the way
*  through the Classical period, through Plato and afterwards, for them to be drinking beer instead
*  of wine is very, very weird. For them to have a secret mystery religion that's not written down,
*  remember the civilization that birthed literature and the concept of the university as we know it
*  is also very weird. So it's like they are retaining this very prehistoric ritual and this very
*  prehistoric beverage, which is beer. And as I trace it back further and further, you can see clues of
*  beer being used in funerary and mortuary rituals as far back as 13,000 years. And there are some
*  who think that that beer actually precedes bread at that moment we call the agricultural revolution,
*  where the upper Petylithic becomes the Neolithic. And Graham writes a lot about this and very
*  beautifully at Gobekli Tepe, for example. So I was able to trace back the potential brewing of
*  religious beer all the way back to Gobekli Tepe. And the speculation is that this religious beer
*  had some ergot in it? Possibly. It's possible. It's possible. We haven't done much testing for
*  ergot that far back. I mean, that's why I wanted to write this book is because the science is
*  relatively new. Archaeochemistry, for example, is relatively new. Some of the better findings
*  have been coming out over the past 20 years, which is like a baby in the sciences. In fact,
*  Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, who I interviewed for the book, described
*  archaeochemistry at the time in the late 90s when he was producing some incredible finds as like an
*  infant, which would make it like a toddler today. And so we're just beginning to put these pieces
*  together. So we can't say there was psychedelic beer 13,000 years ago. The question right now is
*  was there beer at all? And there are there's very early indications at Gobekli Tepe itself
*  that they were brewing beer. And at another site to the southwest in Israel at Mount Carmel outside
*  Haifa, there's this really interesting place called the Rockafet Cave. And it was a burial site with
*  about 30 individuals. This is between 11,700 BC and 9,700 BC. A team from Stanford went in there,
*  and they found these boulder mortars in which they found traces of the malting and mashing of
*  grains, which they think was for beer. This is 13,000 years ago. Which brings us to the
*  upper Paleolithic. And then we have the whole mystery of rock and cave art all around the
*  world. So Brian is right. We haven't got the analysis that proves that a psychedelic was in
*  that 13,000 year old beer. But what we do have 13,000 years ago and going back much further,
*  27, 40, 50,000 years ago, is art. And that art really only makes sense as psychedelic art. I mean,
*  where else but in a visionary state do you see an entity that is part human and part animal
*  in form, that is part a lion and part a human being? It's not something you see every day. It's
*  not something you see when you're out hunting game. But seeing these therianthropes, as they're
*  called, is a very common experience in deeply altered states of consciousness. So the art itself
*  speaks to us of artists who had had powerful experiences in deeply altered states.
*  What is the conventional speculation about those images, the half man, half animal images?
*  Increasingly it is that they document psychedelic states. There's a professor at the University of
*  Witwatersrand in South Africa, David Lewis Williams, written a book called The Mind in the Cave,
*  who's documented this in great detail. That the only possible explanation for this art,
*  which is found all over the world, is not just found in one region or one place, is that the
*  artists were shamans, that they were experiencing altered states of consciousness. And when they
*  returned to a normal everyday state of consciousness, they remembered their visions
*  and painted them on cave walls. And those visions might well be a lion man or a bison man,
*  and that entity had communicated with them just in the way that entities
*  communicate with us today under the influence of DMT or psilocybin.
*  Did you have a sense of urgency while you were writing this? Did you understand that this is
*  something that very few people who are legitimate scholars are going to really tackle?
*  It hadn't been done. And I don't know why nobody was doing this and combining the humanities and
*  the linguistics with the sciences. I've been waiting for this book to come along and no one
*  wrote it. So you had to write it yourself. Since I wasn't doing DMT, I had plenty of free time.
*  How long did it take? 12 years.
*  Wow. Was there any point in time where you were like, what the fuck am I doing?
*  If you ask my wife, yeah, especially. You're supposed to be a lawyer, man.
*  No one's paying you for this. You went to the Vatican?
*  Was there a real issue? Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's,
*  you know what, it's a good point. This is really, really hard. And it brings up something.
*  I've been talking with the researchers about this too. So when I talk about Archaeochemistry,
*  I mentioned Pat McGovern at UPenn. There's another guy, Andrew Koh at MIT. And every time I have a
*  question, these guys are there to answer it. Andrew's awesome. He's a younger guy in his mid-40s.
*  He's been doing this stuff his whole life. He has a background in classics like I do. And so he's
*  the only person I've talked to who sees like the legitimacy of this kind of pursuit because he's
*  one of those guys who can think about the humanities and the sciences at the same time.
*  But it's tough. There is no discipline for this. You can't get a PhD in the hunt for ancient
*  intoxicants. No one's out there studying for it. It just doesn't exist. And those who do study it
*  find it very, very hard to get gainful employment. You can't get paid to do this stuff.
*  And so a little bit later, we'll talk about two Archaeochemists I've been in touch with who have
*  remarkable findings that I want to share here. But they've each since left the discipline. So
*  they were doing incredible work 20 years ago in the late 90s and early 2000s. We're finding
*  incredible things. But I mean, life being what it is, they had to leave the profession.
*  Well, let's get to that now. Who are they and what are they?
*  So there's a couple different guys. One, so there are two finds that I really went out of my way
*  to put into this book. One is trying to find hard evidence of this ergotized beer. And the other
*  is trying to find actual hard evidence of wine that's been spiked. And ideally, that would be
*  spiked wine in the context of some kind of Christian ceremony or some syncretic Greek Christian
*  ceremony in the first century AD. And so I spent years and years trying to get in contact with
*  these folks and reading through the Archaeobotany journals. And I'll start with the ergot first,
*  since I was really kind of fascinated with ergot and this hypothesis from 1978, because it sits
*  there for now 40 years, and there's no hard data to come by. And people often argue about ergot the
*  same way we argue argue about Amanita and the other candidates, because it's it doesn't make sense.
*  We know it's there, we know it's common, but it doesn't make the most sense as the thing that
*  would have spiked this beer. So I spent a long time looking for ergotized beer or any beer that
*  was spiked. Now, if you go to the top archaeochemists or archaeobotanists in the US, the UK, or Europe,
*  and I did for many years, and I asked them the very simple question, is there any botanical or
*  chemical data of beer having been spiked with psychedelics? And the universal answer that would
*  always come back is no. And so I'd ask them again, and the answer would be no. And so I started to
*  think about the ancient world and what that meant and what ancient Greece meant. And so first I went
*  to the site Adalusis to ask the archaeologist there if we could test her vessels. And I couldn't
*  believe that nobody had ever asked her if they could submit the test the vessels to chemical
*  testing. And so I flew there and I talked to her about it. And she said, unfortunately, they've
*  all been treated for conservation purposes. You know, they put them in museums, and they exhibit
*  them to the public. And when you do that, you contaminate the the artifact, and it's no longer
*  testable. So that was my dead end. And that's where things stop for a while. And that's where
*  my wife starts asking, you know, Brian, you flew to Greece by yourself, and left your two daughters
*  at home for no reason. So you could ask a lady if you could test her her chalices. And she told you
*  no. And now what are you going to do? And so I said, Well, I'm gonna get creative, man. And so
*  I thought about the ancient Greek world. Here's the thing about the ancient Greek world in in in
*  the wake of Alexander the Great, who was called the great for a reason, the Greek influence,
*  after the fourth third centuries BC, what stretched all the way from
*  Iberia, Spain and Portugal to Afghanistan, in the east, I'm not sure if many folks realize that,
*  but the the Greek speaking or the Greek influence part of the world was enormous. And so if you're
*  looking for evidence of this Koukian, why would you restrict yourself to Athens and Eleusis? So
*  I took a step back and I started thinking, where else would there be a Greek presence? And I didn't
*  expect to find one, but I landed on Iberia eventually, because I started researching Urgat
*  in different languages. That was that was my first clue. You know, there in English, we have this one
*  weird word for it, Urgat. But actually, in German, there's lots of words for it, bizarrely enough,
*  maybe it's because of the history of brewing. But in German, there's Aftakorn, Mutakorn, Tollkorn,
*  which means crazy corn, crazy green, or Totenkorn, which means death corn. And so it's weird that,
*  you know, as you look elsewhere, it seems to be more common to the German mind. And then in Spanish,
*  I just started random Googling for what that is. It's called cornezuelo de centeno in Spanish. And
*  a couple things started popping up. And these notions of spiked beer started popping up,
*  where they weren't supposed to. I never expected to find them. So the first hit that came in
*  was from an archaeological site kind of in the middle, Midwest of Spain, called the Valle
*  de Olid. And there in 2003, they found a Greek vessel called a Greek chalice called a kernos.
*  And it's the same kind of vessel that's used in the Eleusinian mysteries. It's like this little
*  cup with a tiny cup on the outside. I brought a picture for you if you want to see it. Sure.
*  Jamie, in Mas Castellar, if you scroll to the bottom, and copy of P29.
*  So this came from a site called the Necropolis of Las Ruedas. And the Necropolis of Las Ruedas
*  is this archaeological site that was dated to about the second century BC. Now these aren't
*  Greek people. This is a pre-Roman population called the vacae, or the vaccians. But for some reason,
*  in this kernos, it tested positive for beer spiked with hyoskaimine. If you go to the next tab,
*  you'll see that they wrote it up. It's in Spanish, but there you'll see that at the
*  numbers 76 and 77, when they tested the kernos, which is a very Greek word by the way,
*  when they tested the kernos, it tested positive for traces of hyoskaimine. And hyoskaimine can
*  only occur in these solanaceous plants, these nightshade plants. So it's the family of plants
*  that includes very boring things like the tomato, or the potato, or tobacco. But it has these
*  nightshades like mandrake, again, or henbane. And so it's one of those tropane alkaloids that could
*  have been in henbane, for example. So here you're talking about a henbane beer, which is really
*  weird. The even weirder part is that this is found in a funeral complex. Just like you would find at
*  Gobekli Tepe, or the Rockifet cave in Israel 13,000 years ago. Here, after thousands and
*  thousands of years, you're seeing this pre-Roman population using beer spiked with henbane in a
*  death cult. And where the researchers say that it was used to either facilitate the deceased's
*  travel to the other world, or maybe the people who were there ushering the deceased into the
*  other world. They actually use that phrase. Holy shit. Go back to that image of the cup again, please.
*  So why does it have the cup on the outside of it again? There's the large vessel, and then there's
*  a small vessel to the side of it? We don't know. That's just what a kernos is. If you scroll...
*  Could it possibly have been portion control? Exactly. If you scroll to the top, Jamie,
*  you'll see two other kernoi on the top right there. Yeah. And so this is the next part of the clue.
*  So these came from a colony on the east coast of Iberia called Emporion, which was a bustling
*  Greek colony. And these are other kernos vessels, just like you would see at Eleusis. These are the
*  kinds of things that they think the initiates were drinking from. Now, they don't make for very good
*  drinking vessels, but maybe they make for good mixing vessels, like for dosage control. Something
*  is going on there. That's what they thought the kernos was at Eleusis, for example. And that's
*  what I wanted to test with the archaeologist there who said no. And so now we're finding these
*  vessels in Spain where they're not supposed to be. And I can say as a classicist or a one-time
*  wannabe classicist, the first thing you think of when you think about the ancient Greeks is not
*  Spain. And all of a sudden I'm coming across this idea of spiked beer in Spain, and it's just not
*  supposed to be there. That's so fascinating. So this image, what is the... Can you go back to that
*  original image, Jamie? Yeah, of the cup with the small cup next to it. What is the conventional
*  description of what this is and why it's shaped this way? I mean, the Spanish archaeologists,
*  they also call this a kernos. I mean, the extent of the Greek influence at that particular site,
*  this is the Pintia archaeological site, the extent of the relationship and the network is a little
*  unclear, at least to me. It's unclear how strong the Greek presence was there. But at
*  the time, by the second century BC, because the Greeks were already in these other port cities,
*  basically, it's not inconceivable that some kind of trade was happening and these vessels would
*  have made their way inland. Do they have a description as to why there's a small cup connected
*  to the larger cup, though? It would be the same as any Greek archaeologist has, too. We don't know
*  why this was associated with the mysteries. No one knows why. It really does logically
*  make sense that it would be some sort of a portion because it's very small. Obviously,
*  you don't want to have too much of that shit. Yeah, it really does make complete sense, actually,
*  that that's what it is, that you take one portion of this and mix it with 10 portions of that,
*  and then you're going to have an interesting journey. I can't think of another explanation
*  off the top of my head. Obviously, I'm not qualified to speculate, but when I'm looking
*  at this, I'm thinking, oh, that completely fits. But you're on the right track because
*  that's where it led me to was portion control. Yeah. And that's what I found next. What'd you
*  find next? I found some things, man. What'd you find, man?
*  So, Kerynos, right? I'm thinking Kerynos vessels. And so the vessel doesn't just show up in the
*  middle of Spain there. It shows up on the coast at this. And so this town is called Emporion,
*  and today it's called Empurias, and it's in Catalonia, in northeast Spain, close to the
*  border with France. And to be totally honest, I'd never heard of Emporion, and I'm not sure if many
*  classicists have, but it was a bustling import-export business of the ancient Greeks, founded by the
*  Phocaeans, who came from Ionia, which is today modern-day Turkey. And they found this place in
*  575 BC, and we think that the religion comes with them, or some kind of religion. Jamie, if you go
*  back to Tamas Castellar, you can see just an exterior shot of what this colonial town looks
*  like. And when you look at it, again, there, I mean, it looks, that could be southern Greece. That
*  could be an island in Greece. That's on the northeast coast of Spain. That's a statue of
*  Asclepius, the Greek god of healing, standing in a courtyard in Spain. And the statue dates to?
*  At least 5th century BC.
*  Wow. And we don't know really what's going on, but in the next slide, the Phocaeans who founded
*  this place were devotees of, that's supposed to be Persephone on the left, the Greek goddess
*  Persephone, the goddess of the underworld, the same goddess who the initiates would find
*  when they made their pilgrimage to Eleusis and drank the potion. They went there to meet
*  Persephone. And there she is on their coins. Wow. And then it gets more interesting. How?
*  So these people don't stick to the coast. They go inland at some point. And they go inland for a
*  reason. And there's a site that they found called Mas Castellar de Pontos. It's a tiny town called
*  Pontos. And there's this farm that the archaeologists describe as a Greek farm,
*  a bit further inland. Jamie, if we go back to the same file there, we can just click through a bunch
*  of the images and the kinds of things that they found there, which are indicative of the Greek
*  mysteries. So starting with her, for example, that was unearthed at this archaeological site in Pontos.
*  And the archaeologist responsible for this dig, who's been the same woman since 1990, her name is
*  Enriceta Pons. She found this in other objects. She calls this the head of Persephone. Or it could
*  be the head of Demeter. But either way, she thinks it's a Greek goddess. And this is third century BC.
*  So obviously there's some intense influence. These are Greco-Italian M4i, also dated to the
*  third century BC. And the next one, that's also some kind of Demeter Persephone. That's an incense
*  burner, by the way. You stick incense in the top of it, light it up, depending on what your incense
*  is. And it's used in cult rituals. That's third century BC. And then it gets weirder. They find
*  this fifth century BC. That belongs in a dining room in Athens, not on a farm in Spain. That's
*  the origin of comedy right there, believe it or not. That's called a komos. Komos, in ancient
*  Greek, is one of these drunken parades in honor of the god Dionysus. These are the first paid
*  regulars at the comedy store. And he's got his dick out like Ari Shaffir. There you go. Wow.
*  That's crazy. So then it gets weirder. Just south of the site, they find this. And this is
*  Tryptolimus. Tryptolimus is kind of the missionary of the mysteries. So after Demeter
*  establishes her temple in Eleusis, they send this guy to go scouring the earth to carry the
*  knowledge of the grain and farming across Europe. And if you go to the next one, Jamie,
*  you'll see that it's very similar to the kind of Tryptolimus things that show up in Greece. This
*  is from the Eleusis Museum on site in Eleusis. If you compare the two, you see a dude on a flying
*  dragon cart on the left and a dude on a flying dragon cart on the right. They're both Tryptolimus.
*  The last place I ever expected to find Tryptolimus was a farm in Spain. And there it is. Wow.
*  So if Tryptolimus tells you anything, it tells you that the mysteries went west. When they're not
*  supposed to, by the way. Graham alluded earlier to this incident that happened in Athens in 414 BC.
*  To celebrate the mysteries outside of Eleusis is a sacrilege, a total sacrilege. It was called the
*  profanation of the mysteries. And one of Socrates' star disciples, this guy Alcabietes,
*  was caught indulging in the mystery ceremony at home instead of at the temple. And he became the
*  Ed Snowden of the ancient world. He was ostracized. They would have killed him if he didn't run from
*  Athens. So this was serious stuff and sacred stuff. So for them to be celebrating the mysteries,
*  think about it, kind of makes sense because no one's looking over their shoulder in Spain. If
*  it's going to happen anywhere, maybe it'd be in the hinterlands of the empire.
*  So this is people that realized that they wanted to continue these rituals and couldn't do it in
*  Greece anymore. They had to get out. Right. Or these were folks who either couldn't afford
*  or didn't want to go all the way to Eleusis. I mean, you're in Spain. Imagine getting to,
*  you can't get to Eleusis today. Imagine getting to Eleusis 2000 years ago, 2500 years ago.
*  It's really, really difficult. If I may give a parallel, it's rather like somebody
*  seeking an ayahuasca experience today. And perhaps they can't afford to go all the way to the Amazon
*  rainforest, or it just seems too big a journey. So they're going to look for somewhere nearer to
*  home where they can have that experience. And indeed ayahuasca is available all over the world
*  now. Yeah. And that's pretty recently, right? Like within the last couple of decades, it's available
*  all over the world. Spread rapidly within the last couple of decades. And I think Brian is suggesting
*  that a similar sort of thing was happening in the ancient world with a different substance.
*  The guy's name is so right on the nose too. Triptolomus.
*  I never thought about that until right now. Because I don't do DMT. But I mean, trip,
*  people tripping. I mean, it's just ridiculous that his name is Tripp. It's interesting. I mean,
*  look at him. He's riding a dragon and his name is Triptolomus. And on the next one too, Jamie,
*  you'll see there's another Triptolomus from from Kapua. This is in Italy. So he did go west.
*  We know he went to Italy. And if he went to Italy, why wouldn't he go to Spain?
*  And look at the style of art. It's completely Greek.
*  Wow. Pretty psychedelic at the same time. Yeah, it is. But it's so uniform.
*  Yeah. In the three different locations, you have the same imagery. Wow.
*  And so the question that Wasson, Hoffman and Ruck would immediately ask is what is Triptolomus doing
*  there? Is he really was he really sent as a missionary to teach people how to farm?
*  That's that that's a traditional scene. Isn't that wheat in his hands? That's exactly right.
*  Okay, so he was dispatched. He was dispatched to teach people how to grow cereals. However,
*  across the Neolithic period, people know how to farm. People are already farming. So it starts in
*  the breadbasket at Gobekli Tepe in Anatolia. We have farming across Europe in Greece as early as
*  6500 BC. It's by by 4000 or so BC. It's all over Europe. Why would Triptolomus need to be sent on
*  a mission to teach people to do something they already knew how to do, which is farm? And so
*  what they would say is he was teaching not about growing the grain, but about what grows on the
*  grain, which is erga. Of course. And look, someone's pouring something too. Yeah, that's one of those
*  ritual ablutions. Wow. So then it gets more interesting.
*  Okay. We're waiting, Jamie. We're
*  so waiting, Brian. In addition to Triptolomus and the heads of Demeter and Persephone,
*  Enrique de Pons finds this gem, which is a 250 square foot ritual sanctuary that she calls in
*  Spanish a capilla domestica, which is a household shrine. And she believes it's a household shrine
*  that is specifically dedicated to reenacting the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone for people who
*  wanted to get in touch with their Greek ancestors. And she calls this a ritual room for the living
*  to interact with the dead. Wow. But you still need some Greek influence. So in the next slide,
*  you'll see the altar where the activity was happening. Does that look Greek? Very. So
*  that's a column that was proven by petrographic analysis to have originated at the Mount
*  Pentelechus Quarry, northeast of Athens. It came from Greece and it's sitting in Spain.
*  And what they're doing on that, aside from burning incense all around, is they're sacrificing dogs.
*  They found the remains of three female dogs. There's only one goddess in Greece associated
*  with that, and that's Hecate, who is the mother of the witch Circe and the patroness of all witches.
*  And they're sacrificing dogs to her because she's known as the Kounos Phages in Greek,
*  which is the dog eater. What? God. The other things you find in that room, aside from the Greek altar
*  and the Greek goddess to whom dogs are being sacrificed in an underworld journey where the
*  living and dead are communing, is a Greek hearth. And Hecate uses the Greek word eschara for that.
*  You can go to the next one, Jamie. So in addition to the Greek altar and the Greek hearth,
*  she finds these, which are very Greek-shaped cups. These are called Kantharos. The Kantharos is the
*  ritual vessel that was only used by the god Dionysus to drink his magic potion. She finds about 10 of
*  these in and around the area. And when I heard all this, after the Greek influence is swimming on
*  this place, I called up Karl Ruck, who at the time was 84 years old. He's now 85 years old.
*  And his career was severely impacted after the release of the 1978 book, The Road to Eleusis.
*  His career essentially tanks. It was the classic case of the wrong book at the wrong time.
*  He was not supposed to write this because he did. He was deposed as the chair of the Classics
*  department. He was cut off from grad students. He was discouraged from interdisciplinary scholarship
*  with his colleagues. He became the drug guy. Classicists don't write about drugs, but the book
*  really, really impacted his life. And he became kind of the black sheep of the Classics estate.
*  And there's no evidence to prove that this ergotized beer actually exists. And so, you know,
*  his career kind of went into a nosedive. And so I've been keeping him up to speed on all this work.
*  And so I called him up and invited him to come see this ritual chapel with me. And so that's
*  him getting his very first look at the incense burner and the cup. And there he's in an ancient
*  staring contest with Demeter looking at this cup. And I didn't take him all the way to Spain just
*  so he could look at a cup. It's because of what was in the cup. And so in the mid-1990s,
*  after it was excavated, this woman, Enriqueita, the archaeologist, for some reason, we don't know
*  why, she got in touch with a young archaeobotanist who I mentioned before, Jordi. And they subjected
*  this chalice to analysis. And what they found was beer. Wow. So this thing was filled at some point
*  with some kind of ritual beer that was used in some kind of ceremony dedicated to Demeter
*  and Persephone. But that's not all they found. They also found the remains of ergot.
*  And it is the first and most compelling data to support this scorned hypothesis from 1978
*  that's ever emerged. What was that like for him to experience that? He's had to be just completely
*  mind-blowing, but also frustrating that he was right all along. And I expected that too. And I
*  asked him, I have a video of me talking to him at the chapel. I asked him what this all means.
*  And he's not salty about it. 42 years later? 42 years, yeah. Not at all? No.
*  He's got a good life. He's happy. I think he feels vindicated. And I know he's excited to talk about
*  this in public. And this is the first time we're talking about it in public. And I know he wants
*  to dive deep on this. But this is something he's dedicated his entire professional life to. And
*  he is, you said he's 83? He's 85 now. 85. Yeah. How is he holding up physically?
*  He's okay now. He's in quarantine. He lives in this beautiful pre-revolutionary war home that I
*  went to visit a couple years ago. I describe it as something like the British Museum having been
*  ransacked by a group of mischievous elves. He's surrounded by mushrooms and busts of Demeter. And
*  he's got some artifacts that belong to Gordon Wasson, who was his mentor in many ways.
*  So from 78 on, he was just balls deep in this stuff. He dove head in.
*  Instead of turning around after he was yelled at for being the drug guy, if you look him up,
*  and his CV, it's all he does is write about the potential use of drugs in the ancient world.
*  Did he have personal experiences? Many.
*  Yeah. So that's probably why he started writing about it.
*  As a matter of fact, when I mentioned that letter from Albert Hoffman to Gordon Wasson in 1976,
*  when he self-dosed on the Ergonavine, he sent some in the letter. It says he sent some in the mail
*  to Gordon Wasson, who politely declined and made Ruck do it instead.
*  Wow. So for Ruck, what was it like for you to be able to show this to Ruck,
*  to give him hard evidence, to show him these cups, to tell him about the tests that were done,
*  the fact that they discovered Urgot, the fact that they know these vessels were holding beer?
*  I mean, this vindication to be there physically while this vindication emerges.
*  Psychedelic, man. It was really emotional. I mean, it's still emotional for me. And I mean,
*  to be clear, there's more testing and more analysis that needs to be done. This was 20 years ago.
*  And the breaking news is that that original sample may be stashed away somewhere at the
*  University of Barcelona, and Jordi was going to go look for it. COVID intervened. So we very much
*  want to retest this stuff. Andrew Koh at MIT very much wants to get a chemical sample. So I want to
*  be a little careful, but the way it exists today is extraordinarily compelling. And odds are there's
*  probably even more evidence, some of which hasn't even been excavated. And for Ruck, or for the
*  field in general, I think it's extraordinary. Well, the dots all connect themselves. I mean,
*  that's what's really amazing about it. If you look at what you've discovered, and if you look at the
*  history of these people getting together and having these rituals, and what we know about
*  psychedelics in particular, LSD, and what Albert Hoffman has shown, and any people who have
*  experienced LSD know, I mean, it all fits right in. It all makes sense. It's crazy. It's just,
*  and where would we be if you didn't write this book? That's what's really interesting.
*  There's seven plus billion people on this planet, and it just takes one person to not listen to their
*  wife. The next thing you know. Do you hear that, PJ? Do you hear that? PJ, he was right.
*  Thank God. Is she cool? I think you just saved my marriage. I swear to Christ. I think you just
*  saved my marriage. Is she cool with it now? No. Still no? No, she wants to see how this goes,
*  and then she'll be cool. Oh, it'll go great, man. This book's gonna sell like crazy.
*  Are you gonna do an audio version of it? I read it myself. Oh, nice. When is it gonna be out?
*  It's out. Is it out right now? It should be, or today or tomorrow, yeah. Oh, okay,
*  because I tried to look for it yesterday on Amazon. Really? It wasn't, or on, no,
*  Apple. It wasn't available. Okay, the 29th, I think. Oh, okay. The publication date is the 29th of
*  September, and that's also the same publication date as the paperback of my Lost Civilization
*  book, America Before. I want to be clear that the immortality key is Brian's book. Yes.
*  You wrote the foreword. My contribution to it is the foreword, and I'm grateful to Brian for asking
*  me to do that. I think Brian has done really important work, and I think the next step now
*  is to demystify this field and get more science at work on this subject instead of just closing
*  our eyes and closing our minds to these extraordinary possibilities that we've been
*  radically misled about our own past. Yeah, and I think thanks to the great work of Rick Doblin
*  and Dr. Rick Strassman and yourself and so many other people that have contributed to this,
*  it's now something that people are allowed to speculate about. It's now something that people
*  are allowed to have. Well, to test. Yes. People are having real legitimate conversations about
*  these things now. Yeah. Yeah, this was the attempt to use 21st century science to test an ancient
*  hypothesis, and part of the issue is the ancient Greeks, and the other part's the Christians. I
*  all we had for a long time was Allegro, so I spent some time. If Ruck was right about this,
*  was Ruck right about what he writes about the Christians? And he does write about psychedelic
*  sacraments and the Christians. And what was his speculation about the psychedelic sacraments and
*  the Christians? He also likes the Amanita Muscaria. Really? Yeah. Why is everybody like that one?
*  Do you think it... Well, this is also, I'm asking you as a person who hasn't experienced psychedelics,
*  I do not know very many people that have had successful experiences with it. It's very
*  confusing, but I do recognize that it's... McKenna speculated very much that we've lost our ability
*  to understand how to prepare it, when to prepare it, when to pick it, and that it's seasonal,
*  and there's so many variables. Yeah, we're ignorant about how to use these things. Our society,
*  I speak of a species with amnesia. We've forgotten the old techniques and the old ways of doing
*  things. There's been a concerted effort in the modern world to demonize these substances and
*  to cut them out of our lives and to associate them with irrational behavior and craziness and so on
*  and so forth. And to move forward in this field, I hate to use the word, but it needs to be made
*  more respectable because it's the key to understanding so much about ourselves that
*  has been obscure and mysterious until now. It's just for a person who's experienced it,
*  it's so strange the contrast between the experience itself and the public's perception of it,
*  particularly the average person who has not experienced psychedelics who looks at it like
*  this frivolous, ridiculous thing, like why would you engage in such a thing? Why would you? I mean,
*  I remember I had a conversation with Michio Kaku about it once talking to him about psychedelic
*  mushrooms, and he was basically telling me scientists want to strengthen their mind,
*  they don't want to ruin their mind in that sense. You don't want to waste your mind on drugs.
*  And I was like, oh, there's a guy who needs to do some drugs.
*  Yeah, exactly. People make these kind of statements as though they're facts,
*  yet those people have had no experiences of the substances concerned.
*  But I think for his own career though, for his own career, you almost have to say things like
*  that, or at least then. We're talking when I had this conversation with him more than a decade ago,
*  probably 15 years ago. So when you have these experiences and you run into the conventional
*  perception of these, you understand that these people, almost like what happened with Ruck and
*  what happened with many other scholars that took chances and discussed these things, you wound up
*  being this crazy person. You wound up being this easily dismissed person. And it's very,
*  in many ways, it's discouraged in a very powerful way.
*  And it can be devastating.
*  Because there has been a hugely well-organized and well-funded propaganda war
*  against these substances. Our society prides itself on the alert problem-solving state of
*  consciousness. And the alert problem-solving state of consciousness does have an important role to
*  play. But part of the madness of our society, why it's become so suicidally dangerous, is because
*  the alert problem-solving state of consciousness has been given a monopoly position. And what
*  psychedelics do is they undermine the dominance of the alert problem-solving state of consciousness,
*  and they show us the much wider range of consciousness that is available. And therefore,
*  they are insidious to the powers that be. Those powers that run and control our world today
*  don't want people thinking for themselves. They don't want the propaganda to be unpicked by a
*  mushroom. And that's why we face this propaganda war. And what we're dealing with is the legacy
*  of that propaganda war. And the majority of people unfortunately don't realize that they've
*  been subjected to 50 or 60 years of lying propaganda. They think it's actually all facts.
*  And this is what needs to be unpicked. And we're in the middle of a crisis in this country in
*  regards to police violence and police brutality. And a big part of that is the war on drugs.
*  It's a giant part of it. It's responsible for the Breonna Taylor murder, which is being discussed
*  right now, and people are protesting. That was a war on drugs. No knock rate. That's what that's
*  about. And most of these... It's not a war on drugs at all. This is the thing. It's a completely
*  maniacal idea because ultimately it's not a war on drugs. And I've used this phrase before. It's a
*  war on consciousness. Our society does not want certain kinds of consciousness to be experienced.
*  It wants to shut them down. And it treats us like children. If adults are not free to make
*  sovereign decisions about their own health, their own consciousness, and their own bodies while doing
*  no harm to others, then freedom is a meaningless word. And unfortunately, freedom is a meaningless
*  word in the societies we live in today. We do live in a heavily mind-controlled society where
*  facts are... Where propaganda is disguised as fact.
*  Pete Slauson I agree with you, but I think this battleship
*  is slowly turning. And I think these kinds of conversations that we're having right now,
*  responsible in a big way for shifting the way people perceive these things. For the longest time,
*  the only way we've been explained to, the only way these subjects have been explained to us,
*  has been in demeaning terms. And that these are bad experiences and you're going to wreck your
*  life. You're going to ruin your life. And when we're here saying, well, maybe it'll make you a
*  better person. These are revolutionary thoughts in the 21st century. And the fact that there's so
*  many people that are echoing these statements and so many really intelligent, well-educated people
*  who haven't ruined their lives, who have families and jobs. And they're saying, no, this is actually
*  good for you. Paul Matz And
*  you know, if it comes down, I think it needs to be recast in the issue of individual freedom and
*  individual sovereignty. Of course, there must be limits on individual freedom. We must not do harm
*  to others in exercising our freedom. But really, taking a psychedelic is the least harmful thing
*  it's possible to do to anybody. It's an entirely inward experience. And it should not be controlled
*  by the state and by government. What's happening here is that we're literally being treated like
*  children as adults. And it's a most unfortunate aspect of our society. And the way I see government
*  seeking to use the current crisis to add to its power, to dominate people's lives, to even enter
*  into their homes, to encourage neighbors to snoop on one another. It's a very insidious trend that
*  we're in. And the war on drugs has been a big part of that trend for a long time. But you're right,
*  Joe, the battleship is turning around and it's turning around because people are waking up and
*  they're saying, we're just not going to put up with this shit any longer. We're not going to be
*  told what to do. We're not going to be treated as infants by our government. Here, here. And the
*  thing about the psychedelic argument too, it falls apart, the idea of criminalizing it, because it
*  lacks all of the rationalizations that you can get with crystal meth and cocaine and death, overdose,
*  addiction. Mushrooms are not addicting. They're not addicting in terms of-
*  And even so, we already have laws that deal with negative behavior towards others. So if somebody
*  is on a particular substance and they harm somebody else, we have a law governing that harm
*  that they've done to somebody else. We don't need to have a law that enters the sanctum of the
*  individual's consciousness and tells that person what he or she may think and what he or she may
*  experience. It's a really Huxley-esque or Orwell-esque world that we're messing with here.
*  Now, when you talk to Ruck about Christianity and about the use of the Amanita muscaria mushroom,
*  does he echo the statements of John Marco Allegro? Does he buy into that or does he have a parallel
*  perspective on it? It's interesting. It's kind of a hybrid. In some of his writings,
*  he's a fan of the Amanita. In others, he takes a broader approach. And I think that was my approach
*  looking at this too, because the one thing that pops out at you from the ancient Christian world
*  is wine. And the one thing that pops out at you from the ancient Greek world is this spiked wine.
*  And Ruck does write quite a bit about that in The Road to Eleusis, the same book in 1978 where he
*  talks about this ergatized beer. He is also talking about spiked wine, but again, there wasn't much
*  data to go on for the longest time. So same as I was kind of scouring the ancient world for evidence
*  of this ergatized beer, I took it upon myself to put his other crazy thesis to the test. And I
*  started looking at wine in the ancient world, not just for the Amanita. And I did look for it, by the
*  way. I looked for evidence. I didn't find any, but I found other evidence. And it starts at the Louvre.
*  If I can show you a couple pictures. Jamie, can you go to the Louvre? That's the first time anybody's
*  ever said that to you, Jamie. Jamie, can you go to the Louvre?
*  So in an obscure footnote from 1978, Ruck talks about a Greek priestess's spiking wine.
*  And he makes a reference to an old book from the early 20th century by a German scholar called
*  Frikenhaus. And Frikenhaus talked about this vase that was apparently in the Louvre that nobody had
*  ever seen. And I took it upon myself to try and find that vase. And so at the very top, Jamie,
*  if you click on the drawing, this is a line drawing by Frikenhaus himself of what he apparently saw
*  in the Louvre at some point in the early 20th century, and not many people have seen since.
*  So this is his illustration of what he recalls being on the...
*  Exactly. Exactly. And if you take a look at it or zoom into the woman on the right,
*  you can see her preparing additives for the wine. And we can't really make out what they are.
*  But the way Frikenhaus drew it, it kind of looks like a mushroom in her left hand. You can't really
*  tell. Ruck says the other one is a sprig of some herb. And again, you can't really tell.
*  So I sent an email to the curator at the Louvre, Alexandra Kapdianou. And I said,
*  I'd like to take a look at this. And I'd like to bring my friend along. And my friend is Father
*  Francis Tiso, Roman Catholic priest, who happens to be an expert botanist and herbalist. So I called
*  up Father Francis from his laboratory in the rustic parts of Italy. And I said, Father Francis,
*  since you're trained at Columbia and Cornell and Harvard Divinity School, and you know everything
*  about plants, will you come help identify this for me? And so he said, sure. So we met at the Louvre
*  and we meet Alexandra. And Alexandra says, you know, this vase, I can find it for you,
*  but it's not on exhibition. This is not in the public catalog. This is in our storage room.
*  And if you want, I can take you to the storage room and show you this vase you've been looking
*  for. And I said, great. And she takes us up to the second floor, past the statue of the Winged
*  Victory of Samothrace, and she ushers us into this completely empty stockroom filled of thousands
*  and thousands of Greek wine vessels. And there sitting on a table on the next picture, Jamie,
*  are what she calls G408 and G409. And I believe this is one of the first color photographs taken
*  of them. There it is. And so we don't know what's happening here. But we've moved from those
*  mysteries of Eleusis to the mysteries of Dionysus. And there's Father Francis with the
*  magnifying glass trying to figure out what they're adding to the wine. And again, this is just a
*  painting, right? We don't know if this is recording an actual event, but we're speculating that that
*  may be the artist tried to record something for posterity. And this vase is from? Fifth century
*  BC. It's called Red Figure Pottery. So pretty old. And we take a look. And as we lean in further,
*  I have a mini heart attack because the pottery has been chipped. Just where she's holding the
*  other ingredient. So we have no idea what's in the right hand. But I'll let you try and guess
*  what you think is in the left hand on the next the next close up.
*  So that's completely missing there. And this is all we have left.
*  What is that? It certainly could be a mushroom.
*  But it could be a lot of things, right? It could be a lot of things. So it was a little disappointing.
*  Yeah. Wow. So when he originally saw it, it hadn't been chipped. So it happened.
*  So maybe, I mean, this is how this stuff goes missing. This is how this stuff stays secret.
*  We don't know how or why it was chipped. Maybe he saw it chipped. It was probably chipped at some
*  point in its long 2500 year history. And he just invented something to put there. What I was hoping
*  to find was what you'll see in the next few slides. And this is from a separate houdria,
*  fifth century BC, at a museum in Turkey. And this is something Ruck has turned up over recent years.
*  These are women, very similar Dionesian tradition, adding plants and herbs to
*  their wine. Ruck identifies that as ivy. If you go to the next one, Jamie.
*  Ivy is often associated with Dionysus. Some of the ancient writers refer to
*  wine spiked with ivy as drunkenness. Look at their eyes. Those ladies are tripping balls.
*  Look at their eyes. They're like, whoa. Don't you think? Look at their eyes. That's not normal.
*  Yeah. They are wide eyed. The next ingredient is more interesting.
*  So there's a second ingredient. And the next slide.
*  Yeah, very much the same mushroom. Very mushroom. Yeah. I mean, that
*  would be hard to describe that as anything else.
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  So this is where the pottery takes us, which is not very far. I mean, maybe the artist meant to
*  leave a clue. Maybe it represents an actual ritual. Maybe it doesn't. We do know that the
*  ancient authors are talking about this stuff a lot. You can go to the next slide, Jamie.
*  And after that, whatever the wine was doing to people, this is what it was doing. So when you
*  drank the wine of Dionysus, this is like that that comos. I showed you that vase from Spain.
*  This is not quite a comos, but it's another kind of ritual parade. This is also in the Louvre. If
*  you head downstairs to the Sal de Carriatid, you'll see the Borghese vase from 40 BC. And
*  before that, this is typically how an initiate of the Dionysian mysteries would be pictured.
*  And the next one, Jamie. Right. Before that.
*  So when they drank the wine of Dionysus, it wasn't to get drunk. Which one are you?
*  Number 15. Borghese. Yeah.
*  So I've never seen anyone walk up the middle aisle in a Catholic mass and walk away looking like that.
*  Yeah, that dude looks smashed though. It doesn't look like he's on mushrooms.
*  He looks drunk. What is that thing on above his shoulder though? That looks like a mushroom.
*  Rug. So that's called a thyrsos. And the top part is called the narthex, cognate with narcotics.
*  And Rug thinks it's where they stuffed all the additives. It's where they stuffed all the toxins
*  for the wine. And you often see the initiates of Dionysus carrying these. And you often see them
*  over the head of the initiate. They didn't go anywhere without their thyrsos wands.
*  And this wand, what was the top of it made out of? Like bundled leaves. It was a hollow stalk
*  with bundled leaves in there. Rucba leaves that they would put their stash.
*  Wow. So their whole thing was just adding things to alcohol, adding things to wine,
*  adding things to beer. In fact, it would be abnormal not to add something to wine. So wine
*  is routinely described in the ancient Greek as unusually intoxicating, seriously mind-altering,
*  occasionally hallucinogenic and potentially lethal. And for that reason, one of the words used to
*  describe wine for like a thousand years from Homer to the fall of the Roman empire was pharma con,
*  which is drug. Pharmacy. That's the word they used ritually, formulaically to describe wine,
*  because it was routinely spiked with toxins and herbs and plants.
*  Now was this just when they were having these rituals? But when they were eating,
*  they would just drink wine normally, right? There was everyday table wine like we have today,
*  but it was more, you know, they wouldn't take two pills with a glass of water. They would dissolve
*  their medicine into wine. Wine is described by Pat McGovern at UPenn, for example, as the universal
*  palliative. That's how you would self-administer medicine. It's why Dioscorides, when I mentioned
*  in the Materia Medica from the first century AD, it's why he has all these recipes. A lot of them
*  are just medicinal. You know, not all of them resulted in these fantastic visions. When he
*  talked about your swollen genitals, it's because he was trying to offer a recipe for that. And that
*  goes back hundreds and hundreds of years into the Greek tradition. But the interesting part of it is
*  that if you go all the way back to Homer, eighth, seventh century BC, you do find this other kind of
*  wine being mixed. Wine for a ritualistic purpose, like Circe, the famous witch, the daughter of
*  Hecate, who we found in Spain. So Circe is routinely, again, mixing, Homer calls it farmaca
*  lugra, evil drugs, into the wine. You could also mix healing drugs into the wine, but there were,
*  there was essentially a whole pharmacopeia available to them.
*  Wow. Thank God you wrote this book, man.
*  There's more.
*  There's more. Keep going.
*  There's more. There's more, PJ. Okay, so when we're not just looking, okay, so for a long,
*  long time, it's been the literature. It's been, you know, vase and pottery, and it's been
*  statuary like the Borghese vase. I was interested, the whole point I wrote this book is again to
*  apply 21st century science to it. So in my conversations with Pat McGovern and Andrew
*  Coe at MIT, I started to find the initial clues for actual wine that was actually spiked, okay,
*  not just, not just in the abstract. So Jamie, if you open this up real quick,
*  to graveyard wine, which is how I refer to it.
*  So if you look at graveyard wine, go to the number scorpion wine right there.
*  So I was looking for evidence of wine actually being spiked in antiquity. This comes from Egypt.
*  This is at Abydos, 3150 BC. It's so old, it's pre-dynastic. This is Scorpion I.
*  They found 700 wine jars that were subjected to chemical analysis. Pat McGovern did the testing,
*  Pat McGovern did the testing, and they found it to be spiked with savory,
*  wormwood, blue tansy, balm, senna, coriander, germander, mint, sage, and thyme.
*  Whoa.
*  And you can find that he published that in 2009, I believe, ancient Egyptian herbal wines.
*  And wormwood is some type of psychedelic.
*  I thought that too. It's not?
*  It is. Artemisia absintheum is psychoactive. McGovern thinks this was Artemisia seberi,
*  which is a slightly different species. But when you look at it from afar, there's
*  something more than just table wine there. These were intentionally spiking the wine for a reason,
*  and they're deposited as grave goods for a reason. And the reason would seem to be for ushering the
*  the pre-Pharaoh into the afterlife. They were there with him to aid the journey.
*  And we're not going to talk about the underworld journey in Egypt with Graham Hancock without
*  asking Graham Hancock what he thinks about ancient Egyptian funerary practice.
*  Well, there's no doubt that the ancient Egyptians were very focused on death,
*  not in a negative way. They saw this life as our opportunity to prepare for the adventure and the
*  challenge of death. That we had whatever years we got, 70, 90, 20, however many years we got,
*  that was our opportunity to prepare for that great challenge of the journey that follows death.
*  And there's no doubt in my mind that the ancient Egyptians did make use of psychedelic substances.
*  The blue water lily from ancient Egypt being an example, jars of that. Again,
*  diluted in wine were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. This is a psychedelic brew.
*  And when you look at ancient Egyptian art, the entities which are very often part animal,
*  part human in form, and which are teachers of mankind, you find yourself again in that same
*  realm that people using psychedelics today find themselves in. DMT in particular,
*  encountering entities that speak to us, that teach us, and that often take the form of part animal,
*  part human therianthropes. It's so interesting to see the actual evidence of this use. And
*  do Egyptologists dismiss this? Do they embrace this? Is this something that is not controversial?
*  I think Egyptologists will say that the ancient Egyptians were neurotically focused on death.
*  I would say the opposite. I would say they had a very balanced approach to death. One thing is
*  clear. We're all going to die. Nobody doubts that. Sooner or later, that moment in our life is going
*  to come where life ends. And to me, that is an incredibly important moment. And the ancient
*  Egyptians, by devoting their culture to figuring out how we live best in order to cross that bridge,
*  to transit into that other realm, were being very practical and very profound in their inquiries.
*  It wasn't that they were afraid of death. They wanted to ready themselves for the journey that
*  follows death. And they made it very clear that everything we do in this life, everything counts.
*  Nothing is separated away. There's nothing that we can deny. There's complete clarity in the
*  afterlife realm. Nothing can be hidden. We're confronted with absolute truth. And in a way,
*  psychedelics are a preparation for that. Because psychedelics also confront us with absolute truth.
*  And that's why psychedelics can often be very uncomfortable. Because we see the truth about
*  ourselves. But we're being given an opportunity to change ourselves for the better and to be more
*  nurturing and more positive and more useful people. And as a result, the ancient Egyptians would say
*  to confront a better death.
*  – What I was getting at was what is their reaction to the psychedelically spiked wine?
*  Because I know you, particular Graham...
*  – Egyptologists don't want anything to do with psychedelics.
*  – That's what I wanted to know.
*  – They don't want anything to do with psychedelics. They would prefer not to go there.
*  And just as there are many other aspects of ancient Egyptian culture that the Egyptologists
*  don't want to go into, it often seems to me that they're in the process of trying to
*  carve or shape ancient Egypt to fit into modern ideology. And that's a great pity.
*  – Well, it's also a great pity that, particularly with your work and the work that
*  you've done with Dr. Robert Schock, describing some indications on some of the ancient structures
*  that there was heavy erosion that was due to rainfall, thousands of years of rainfall,
*  which would have predated the conventional idea of when these things are constructed,
*  the way that they resisted that. Instead of looking at it like this fascinating new
*  evidence that will illuminate this field and now we have some new perspective on this,
*  they rejected it so horrifically. And they were mocking... I remember that. Who is that
*  one Egyptologist that openly mocked the concept of it?
*  – But not just one. Many Egyptologists.
*  There's a film. The one that there was the document...
*  – Ken Fedder maybe.
*  – Yes. The Charlton Heston narrated the documentary.
*  – Yes. I think you may be speaking about Ken Fedder, but really I could cite a dozen
*  Egyptologists who feel this way. The notion that the Great Sphinx is 12,500 years old,
*  which is a notion based on the erosion patterns on the body of the Sphinx,
*  is utterly unacceptable to Egyptologists. They just don't want to go there. They don't want
*  to consider that possibility because they feel that they've got ancient Egyptian history taped,
*  that it begins about 5,000 years ago. There's a bit of a precursor in the pre-dynastic period,
*  a thousand or so years building up to ancient Egypt. And then you have ancient Egyptian
*  civilization and gradually it merges with the Greeks and with other cultures and spreads out
*  around the world. The notion that there is a background to ancient Egyptian civilization that
*  goes back into the Ice Age is a notion that no Egyptologist is prepared to accept. The moment
*  they start accepting that notion, they cease to be Egyptologists in the view of their colleagues.
*  It's a very dangerous idea to contemplate. And that's why I spent the last quarter of a century
*  trying to argue the case for a lost civilization, that maybe I'm not right about everything,
*  but we shouldn't neglect the hints and the clues, whether it comes from astronomy,
*  whether it comes from geometry, whether it comes from geology, whether it comes from the statements
*  of the ancient Egyptians themselves about their origins and their past. We shouldn't be ignoring
*  this. We should consider it. And you're right, rather than reacting with fury to the notion of
*  a much more ancient Sphinx, it would have been nice to have seen the Egyptological profession
*  react with interest to it and begin to explore it and consider what it might mean, because the
*  geology is irrefutable, but largely ignored. The erosion, was it on the body of the Sphinx,
*  or was it on the walls of the temple where the Sphinx was carved out of? Well, where you can see
*  it today is, so the Sphinx is carved out of solid bedrock. It's carved out of the bedrock of the
*  Giza Plateau. And in order to do that, an enormous trench was created around the body of the Sphinx.
*  And in fact, the blocks that were excavated from that trench were then moved over and used to build
*  what are called the Valley Temple and the Sphinx Temple, where in some cases you find blocks of
*  limestone that weigh close to 200 tons. And what has happened since then is that the body of the
*  Sphinx has been subjected to multiple restorations. In fact, one of the arguments that Egyptologists
*  just ignore is that already in the Old Kingdom, at the time when the Sphinx is supposed to have
*  been made, according to conventional Egyptology, already in the Old Kingdom they were restoring it.
*  And there are restoration blocks on the body of the Sphinx that date back four and a half thousand
*  years. And that process of restoring and renovating the Sphinx has gone on down the ages. It's still
*  happening today. The pores of the Sphinx as we see them today are covered entirely with modern
*  restoration blocks. We don't see the bedrock underneath it, but where we do see the original
*  bedrock is in the walls of that trench that was carved out to create the body of the Sphinx in the
*  first place, because nobody's been restoring those. And it's in those that you see this
*  characteristic undulating pattern that speaks of exposure to a very long period of heavy, heavy
*  rainfall. And the last time you have that heavy rainfall in Egypt is the period that geologists
*  call the Younger Dryas, roughly between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago. So the body of the Sphinx,
*  the trench out of which it is carved, is saying, I am 12,000 years old. And the only argument
*  against that really is the head of the Sphinx being the typical head of an ancient Egyptian
*  pharaoh with the Nemes headdress. But of course, the head of the Sphinx was originally a lion,
*  just as the body of the Sphinx is a lion. And the head of the Sphinx was re-carved in dynastic times
*  to give it this human form. The reaction to that notion and this hard geological data that Robert
*  Shock provided was just the most disturbing part of it. Let's pay tribute to John Anthony West.
*  Yes, sure.
*  Because it was John Anthony West who originally had that brilliant insight
*  that what we're looking at in the case of the Sphinx is water weathering. And he rightly pays
*  tributes to Swaleh de Lubix, an earlier scholar, who was the first to notice this. And John then
*  brought Robert Shock to Egypt as a professional geologist, Robert is professor of geology at the
*  University of Boston. And it brought him there. And Robert Shock indeed concluded that we are
*  looking at water weathering on the body of the Sphinx. And gradually, Robert initially was very
*  cautious. He was saying, well, the Sphinx must be seven or 8,000 years old. But much more recently,
*  he's also settled on the date of roughly 12,000 years old as the last time that you would get that
*  sort of heavy rainfall in Egypt that could have created that characteristic weathering.
*  And I would encourage anybody who's interested in this to please check out John Anthony West's
*  Magical Egypt series because it's amazing. I've probably seen it 15 times.
*  I'm so glad that you had John on your show, Joe, because you did also very, I know it's very rare
*  that you do things by Skype.
*  But we did in person as well. I had him on twice. Yeah, I had him on in person before he died and I
*  had him on Skype before that.
*  What an amazing man he was. Such a radical, such an incendiary, just planting intellectual bombs in
*  the accepted wisdom of the modern world and making us all think again. So I think when it comes to
*  the age of the Sphinx, it's really important to realize the role that John Anthony West played.
*  And I'm so glad that you had him on your show.
*  Yeah, I am as well. It was a real honor.
*  Dear friend of mine, and I was with him just a month before his death and he went into that
*  journey of death with enormous courage and absolute certainty.
*  Now, when these vessels were tested and these psychedelic compounds were detected,
*  what was the reaction? Was there resistance to this? How was it received?
*  We don't think they're properly psychedelic just yet. I mean, all the ingredients that that-
*  Psychoactive?
*  Psychoactive, medicinal for sure. There wasn't much backlash that I know of after
*  McGovern's study. It was a gold standard study and then it continued, by the way.
*  So after those 700 jars at Abydos, after further analysis, they determined that the plants and
*  herbs actually originated in the Holy Land in the southern Levant. They weren't native to Egypt.
*  They had been brought there or they were shipped there by the folks in the Holy Land, which gets
*  more interesting because the next big find was the world's oldest wine cellar, which was published
*  in 2014. It came from Tel Kabri, which is also in Galilee. Remember, this is going to be the same
*  Galilee that Jesus comes on the scene and Christianity bursts across the planet.
*  So at Tel Kabri in 2014, they found another stash of wine, dubbed the world's oldest wine cellar,
*  also subjected to archeochemical analysis. And what Andrew Koh and the team there found
*  was wine spiked with honey, storax, terebinth, cypress, cedar, juniper, mint, myrtle, and cinnamon,
*  or at least cinnamaldehyde. Another very strange mixture. Doesn't sound very psychedelic though.
*  No, no, not at all. So they just were into spiking wine. They love spiking wine, but what Andrew Koh
*  says about it is interesting though. And that's why I reached out to him originally, because he says
*  that spiking wine with this many ingredients is indicative of a very sophisticated understanding
*  of the botanical landscape. And he says, he says, quote, it demonstrates the pharmacopeic skills
*  necessary to balance preservation, palatability, and psychoactivity. He uses that word. Preservation,
*  like in the terebinth, for example, you know, resonating the wine so it doesn't spoil to vinegar.
*  And then palatability, if there is cinnamon or honey that you mentioned before too, it would
*  improve the flavor profile. But then psychoactivity, who knows? We don't know which
*  juniper it was, but there is juniper used in other psychoactive ceremonies. There's a species of
*  juniper, Juniperis recurva, which occurs near the Himalayas actually. And there's, I've seen videos,
*  really cool videos, if you want to pull it up, Jamie, you can look up, if you Google, anybody can
*  do this, GB shaman. If you look up GB space shaman, you'll see a ritual of someone inhaling
*  the juniper, the incense from juniper, and going into trance.
*  How much is written about wine and the additives and all the different things they put to wine?
*  Well, let's watch this first. There's not much written about it. You might have to skip forward,
*  but this is them essentially preparing. What are we looking at here? So that's a, that's a,
*  that's a, what they call the betayo. The betayo are their traditional healer prophets and shamans
*  of this tribe in the Hindu Kush. And what they do is they inhale the incense from burning juniper
*  and then suck the blood from a goat head. Wow. Jesus Christ. And it says things people get up to.
*  That's what happens when you outlaw psychedelics. People try anything.
*  Yeah. Sucker goat head. Wow. And so this is the Hunza people. And it says it puts him into a trance
*  whereby he's able to communicate with the fairies.
*  Look at that guy. Skeptical. He's like, I'm not buying it. This guy's always been annoying.
*  Look at him. He's like, oh, he just wants to put on a robe and dance. And he kind of looks like a
*  guy who would do that too. And there's the headless goat. The headless goat. Exactly. Oh boy. Hey boy.
*  And what is there? Do they explain? Oh, here he goes. He's sucking on the goat head. Okay.
*  This guy's annoying. Look at him. Look at how he's dancing. And he's putting on a show. Everybody's
*  like, look at him. And he's like, look at me. I'm sucking on the goat head. I'm so crazy. I bet the
*  goat head doesn't really do anything. I bet the goat head is just so he gets extra attention. Look
*  at the kids. Like, wow, this guy's crazy. Look at him. Yeah. A little bit of Borat in there too.
*  Wow. Okay. Now, is it usually more than one person? This is what's odd. Is that this one guy is tripping
*  balls and then he collapses and then everybody else is just going, oh, it's Marty. Look at Marty.
*  Marty's getting crazy. And then he's got to rinse his hands off. And is this something that other
*  people, this is what's weird about this video. It seems like one person is having a psychedelic
*  ritual and the rest of them are just watching this guy. He was the spiritual technician, the way you
*  find in other traditional societies. He was the one who trained to navigate that other world and
*  learn the fairy language, apparently. Fairy language. The fairy language. Yeah, it is weird
*  that those fairies and elves and all these different things exist in so many different
*  cultures. And they are what you do see if you do take enough psychedelics with the right kind
*  and the right setting. Is that true? Yeah. I've met Jeff. It's true. My take on this when I wrote
*  Supernatural is that we have three supposedly different domains of experience. We have the
*  spirits whose shamans encounter in altered states of consciousness. We have fairies and elves from
*  the Middle Ages. Very often in illustrations you'll see that the mushrooms are present
*  in the illustrations. And then today we have aliens. And at the level of phenomena,
*  there are extremely close similarities between the entities that we call aliens today,
*  the entities that were called fairies or elves in the Middle Ages, and the entities that shamans
*  refer to as spirits. And I would say actually what we're dealing with is the same experience
*  in all three cases, but viewed through different cultural lenses and construed in different ways.
*  And the only thing that really explains these kinds of experiences, where any one of us can
*  actually share that experience and have that experience, is psychedelics. Powerful psychedelics
*  like DMT will plunge us into that realm of experience. And we will meet entities. And
*  many people today do construe those entities as aliens because that's how our culture is dealing
*  with the other today. Have you ever experienced anything that looked like what the classic iconic
*  alien is? Yeah, I have. You have? Really? Absolutely. In one of my early ayahuasca experiences
*  in the Amazon, I saw flying saucers. My eyes were closed, but I saw flying saucers. And then I saw
*  this classic sort of quote unquote gray with that high domed forehead and narrow pointed chin and
*  these really grim eyes looking down on me. I think I may have mentioned this on your show before,
*  but what I really regret doing, I felt I was going to be taken. I felt I was going to be abducted.
*  And I opened my eyes and I shouted, no. Of course, I should have kept my eyes closed and said, yes,
*  take me. But I didn't do that. And I've never encountered them in that quite alien form again.
*  Oh, that's a bummer.
*  Yes, it is a bummer. But we have to consider the possibility that these are not simply concoctions
*  of our brains, that the brain is a much more complicated mechanism than we think it is,
*  and that in certain circumstances when brain chemistry is altered in the right way,
*  we gain access to other levels of reality that are normally closed off to our senses. That is
*  personally my view that what's happening with psychedelics, I can't prove that that's the case,
*  but the sense that we are entering a seamlessly convincing parallel world, that it is inhabited
*  by intelligent beings and that they have things to say to us. First of all, this is universal.
*  People who've worked with psychedelics all around the world have had those experiences.
*  And secondly, I just don't see this. I don't see why we've all got a brain module for this.
*  I think we are actually peering through the doorway into another level of reality,
*  but it's going to take a whole lot more research to prove that. That's just my own personal opinion.
*  My personal opinion mirrors yours. My feelings have always been when I do psychedelics that
*  I've tuned into a frequency that's unavailable to me during regular states of consciousness.
*  It doesn't seem like a hallucination. It seems like I entered into a doorway and I'm in a new place
*  and there's an urgency to it because I know that I'm not going to be able to stay here for very
*  long. They seem to know that and they seem to communicate with you in a very urgent way.
*  One of the things that I've talked about this experience before, one of the most profound ones,
*  I met jesters who were giving me the finger. They seemed to be explaining to me that I take myself
*  too seriously. It felt like, and then when I went, oh, okay, they went, yes.
*  Yeah, you got it.
*  You got it. I was like, oh, yeah, you're right. It was a feeling like, oh, yeah, okay.
*  You think of yourself too highly.
*  That's why the subtitle of my book Supernatural back in 2006 was meetings with the ancient
*  teachers of mankind. I think that's what's going on here. I think that the psychedelics allow us
*  to enter a realm where we encounter teachers who can help us to be better people and perhaps to be
*  a better civilization.
*  Well, that was one of the more interesting things about, I believe it was University of Jerusalem,
*  their take on what Moses in the burning bush was. Very likely the burning bush was the acacia tree,
*  which is very rich in dimethyltryptamine.
*  DMT.
*  Yeah, and that this was what, I mean, when you say it that way, you're like, oh, of course,
*  Moses, the burning bush was God talking to him. And you think about the translation between ancient
*  Hebrew and then to Latin and to Greek and all these, and then the English eventually like,
*  of course, there's going to be a lot lost in the translation. But if you just looked at it that way,
*  you'd be like, oh, so that's a psychedelic drug. Oh, you've done that. Oh, if you do,
*  you kind of do meet something that seems like you would describe as God. And it's very moral.
*  DMT. Yeah, you meet, in what other state of consciousness do you meet intelligent plants
*  that communicate with you? It's very hard to imagine any other state of consciousness apart
*  from the psychedelic state. And what you're citing is the work of Benny Shannon, who is a professor
*  at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. And he has drunk ayahuasca himself at least 700 times. I mean,
*  he's got his boot feet. Well, he's suspect then. I don't know if we should listen to him anymore.
*  But he's a really serious, exactly. Any scholar who goes into this area and really does it properly
*  faces skepticism and being shoved off to the side by his or her colleagues. It takes courage
*  to do this work. But what we need is more scientists doing this work,
*  girding up their courage and getting on with it, because we need to learn about this aspect
*  of ourselves. We've just got such an incomplete picture at the moment.
*  It all falls into place if you look at it under that description. And I'm glad he has the courage
*  to step up and actually put this description out there. I remember someone sent it to me
*  in an email. And I was like, aha, there it is. Of course.
*  Benny Shannon's book is called Ayahuasca, The Antipodes of the Mind. It's a really important
*  piece of work, but not widely enough read in my view. Is there a cultural version of Ayahuasca
*  where there is an MAO inhibitor and a plant with dimethyltryptamine outside of the Amazon?
*  Is there an equivalent? Well, sure. That was also part of Benny Shannon's argument in ancient
*  Israel that you have certain mimosa, which contain the DMT, and then you have
*  homiline in other plants that contain the monoamine oxidase inhibitor. So you can have these
*  what are called ayahuasca analogues, which are doing essentially the same thing.
*  I've consumed ayahuasca analogues myself, and they are very like ayahuasca, but not quite.
*  There is a difference. Again, I'm going to sound very mystical and kind of woo-woo here,
*  but there is a spirit in ayahuasca. It's a female spirit. It's a goddess. And I've not encountered
*  her with the analogues, only with ayahuasca from the Amazon.
*  And what have the analogues been like? The experience is still psychedelic?
*  Yes, very much so. The visions, the encounters with entities, the amazing
*  geometric patterns, and the self-reflection. What the fuck have I been doing with my life up till now?
*  But why did I make that mistake? Why did I hurt that person in that way? But that feeling of a
*  direct intimate encounter with a, I call her a goddess. I mean, sometimes she appears in,
*  and I can hear my critics out there laughing at me now. Hancock has completely lost it.
*  But sometimes she appears in the form of a human woman, sometimes in the form of a serpent.
*  And then we get into the whole issue of the Garden of Eden and the story of the Garden of Eden and
*  the role that the serpent plays in that story. And the role that the serpent plays in that story
*  is pointing out to Adam and Eve that God has basically lied to them. And he offers Adam and
*  Eve the forbidden fruit. Alex Gray, my friend, the visionary artist, Alex Gray, calls it the
*  first psychedelic slapdown. That's what the Garden of Eden is. So, you know, there are these
*  intriguing experiences that are unleashed with these substances. But to my mind, there is something
*  very special about ayahuasca. It's a living ancient technology. You can trace it back
*  thousands of years in the Amazon, and it's now coming out of the Amazon and finding its way
*  around the world. And that ancient fresco that shows Adam and Eve standing by mushrooms
*  is very bizarre as well, right? Yeah, absolutely. Again, our psychedelic heritage
*  has been hidden from us. And that is why I value Brian's book, The Immortality Key, so much,
*  because it's done the solid scientific groundwork to begin to give academic scientists permission
*  to investigate this field. And that's what we need. We need much more work done in this field
*  than has been done already. Man, how good does it feel to have put this down to paper and just
*  set it up? Or do you feel like now that it's out there, you have a lot of explaining to do?
*  I think there's lots of explaining to do. It's funny, though, when, and we haven't gotten into
*  too much of the Christian material yet, but I went through the Vatican quite a bit when I was
*  writing this, with different departments at the Vatican. The Vatican Secret Archives and the
*  Archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Vatican Museums and all the
*  Catacombs in Rome. And I went through there spelunking with Father Francis. And to be totally
*  honest, the Vatican couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating to me. And while some of this
*  is controversial, they've been very supportive to date. And I say that as someone who went to 13
*  years of Catholic school, including four years with the Jesuits, they always encouraged me to
*  ask questions about the origins of the faith. And there's lots and lots of questions there.
*  There's a reason that today you can look around and find 33,000 denominations of Christianity.
*  I think that was the case from the very beginning. There was never one monolithic form of the faith,
*  and people didn't go to bed in 33 AD as pagans and wake up in 34 AD as Christians. It was a
*  process, an intercultural process, that took hundreds of years, which I call paleo-Christianity,
*  which I think for anyone interested in the faith is kind of the most interesting part.
*  These are the earliest and most authentic Christians, but they were living in a world
*  where the blood of goats and all this spiked wine was the norm. And as a matter of fact,
*  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about this, of all people. Yeah, this is called the pagan continuity
*  hypothesis, the idea that Christianity wasn't born in a vacuum. In 1950, Dr. King wrote a paper
*  called The Influence of the Mystery Religions on Christianity. You can Google it, and you can Google
*  it, and you can read it. This was not controversial woo-woo stuff, at least in 1950. When I went to
*  the Vatican, I was really fortunate. We hired a professional guide, he was a professor. There it
*  is, The Influence of the Mystery Religions on Christianity, Dr. Martin Luther King.
*  It's impressive. It's amazing. We got really fortunate, we have this amazing guide, and
*  we were in the middle of this one area of the Vatican, and there was a giant pine cone. Oh yeah,
*  and so he brought it up, like what do you think that stands for? And I said, probably the pineal
*  gland, and his eyes lit up, and we had this conversation, and then we started talking
*  about drugs. You know too much, Joe Rogan. And so he just loved the fact that I knew that,
*  and that I was into this, and then we had a fantastic time. But there's a lot of mushroom
*  imagery, and iconic mushroom shapes, and this connection between mushrooms and Christianity.
*  You can find it. There's a lot of, one of the weirder ones, when Jack Herrera was alive,
*  he was working on, Jack Herrera was a guy who was a Goldwater Republican, and became a cannabis
*  advocate. When he got divorced, and met a girlfriend, and he thought pot was for losers,
*  but he just wanted to get high with this cute girl, and smoked a little pot, he was like,
*  where has this been all my life? Holy shit. And then he became a cannabis advocate, and I was very
*  fortunate to meet him before he died, and he was showing me some stuff that he was working on.
*  But one of the things that he was working on after, you know, he wrote that book, The Emperor
*  Wears No Clothes, but then he wrote, he was writing a book about mushrooms and Christianity.
*  And there was these ancient images of these naked people dancing in ecstasy, and they were
*  surrounded by this translucent mushroom image. And it was really fascinating, and there was a
*  lot of these images, and images that were the shape of doors that were carved out in the form
*  of a mushroom. And that this, it only makes sense if you know what psychedelic mushrooms do when you
*  take them. You have these incredible experiences, and the idea that a religion would emerge out of
*  these experiences is not unusual at all. No, especially if it was common in ancient Greece.
*  That's why I try to focus on that continuity from the ancient Greeks to the Christians,
*  because again, these are the same people. The earliest Christians were all Greek speaking.
*  When Paul is writing his letters, which is the majority of the New Testament, the 21 of the 27
*  books of the New Testament, he's writing in Greek to Greek people. He's writing to the Corinthians
*  who speak Greek, the Thessalonians in Thessaloniki, now the second largest city in Greece, the
*  Philippians, and then in modern-day Turkey to the Ephesians and Colossians and Galatians.
*  Christianity is born in Galilee, or at least grows up in Galilee, but it doesn't take root there.
*  It goes to the Greek speakers, and it goes across all the Greek-influenced areas, including
*  Magna Graecia, which is Great Greece, which is southern Italy, which happens to be the same place
*  where the Catholic Church put down its roots 2,000 years ago. The reason for that was because the
*  early church was all Greek, and these were people who were steeped in the traditions
*  of their ancestors. Imagine abandoning the religion of your grandparents for this new
*  wine god from one day to the next. It doesn't make that much sense. The thesis of the book is that
*  the Eucharist, for some communities, at some point in time, at some area in this Greek-speaking
*  part of the world, would have availed themselves of the kind of sacraments that were available to
*  the Greeks for generations and generations. We're still looking for the smoking gun of that ancient
*  Greek-spiked wine. It's not there. We talked about the Abydos wine in Egypt, the herbal wine
*  from Telkabri in Galilee. So we've been looking in Greece and Turkey and Italy and elsewhere for
*  that Greek-spiked wine and haven't quite found it yet. But Andrew Koh is very interested in continuing
*  to test and find more things, but in the meantime, we did find spiked wine. Yeah, so you have evidence
*  of spiked wine now. It's just finding it in Greece. I think you want to find it in Greece to tie it to
*  Dionysus. You want to find it in Italy to tie it to the Christians because that's really the area
*  where the church, again, puts down roots and begins to grow up in that period of paleo-Christianity.
*  And so just like I was looking for that ergotized beer, I was looking for evidence of where
*  you could properly call it psychedelic wine may have popped up. And there is one article
*  in one archaeobotany journal from 20 years ago that talks about spiked wine, which was news to me
*  too, because every single time I go to the Pat McGoverns and Andrew Kohs and all the top
*  archaeobotanists in Europe, the answer you get back, just like the answer to the question,
*  where is the spiked beer? The answer is there isn't any. And it's another case of this evidence
*  just either being ignored or under-reported. But there was a young at the time archaeobotanist,
*  Marina Ciaraldi, who was from Naples and got her PhD in archaeology in the UK. And she's on site
*  in Pompeii testing these vessels. We have a lot of evidence from Pompeii, by the way. In fact,
*  a lot of what we know about the ancient world comes from Pompeii and Herculaneum because of Mount
*  Vesuvius in 79 AD. It explodes and destroys everything, but it also preserves everything.
*  Under like 17 feet of volcanic ash, we have all these clues about the Dinesian mysteries. And in
*  addition to that, there was this farmhouse in Scafatti just to the east of Pompeii where there
*  were seven dolia, which is like a giant storage vessel. And these dolia are found in a cella
*  vinaria, like a wine cellar, in a farm that also came complete with a torcularium, like a wine press
*  and a threshing floor. So something about wine was happening in this place. We don't know what.
*  The sample was extraordinarily well preserved. When Marina went in there, it wasn't a chemical
*  analysis. That's obviously more fine, more finely graded. The sample was in such good shape because
*  it had been waterlogged. So the botanical samples were in pristine condition, and she could tell
*  by the seeds and stems and other plant material what was there. And there were over 50 species of
*  plants and herbs and trees in this one sample, which is really weird, even more than we found
*  at Abydos or Telkabri. It was like a just a melange of plant material that shouldn't be there.
*  And what she found, in addition to many other medicinal plants, was opium, cannabis, henbane,
*  and black nightshade. What is henbane? Henbane is the is hyoskiumus. It's hyoskaimine is one of
*  those tropane alkaloids, that nightshade plant, that very witchy kind of plant that we found in
*  the Cernos in Spain. It was beer potentially spiked with henbane. So we're finding wine
*  spiked potentially with henbane. We find four seeds at least. There were two seeds of opium,
*  nine seeds of cannabis, four seeds of henbane, and then two seeds of this black nightshade.
*  And in the article that describes it, Marina herself, the archaeobotanist, says this is some
*  kind of spiced wine. In fact, she calls it a Mithradatium. Now to understand that, there was
*  this guy Mithradates. Mithradates VI was the ruler of the Pontus region in between the black and
*  Caspian seas. His father was poisoned to death, and so to prevent that, he would microdose his
*  whole life. He was poisoning himself day in and day out, and so this potion of many different toxic
*  herbs and plants becomes known eventually in the Roman Empire as a Mithradatium, after Mithradates.
*  Now when the Romans finally get to him and try and kill him, he tries to poison himself,
*  and it doesn't work because he's immune. So one of his soldiers has to stab him to death.
*  So he's microdosing himself in preparation for someone else poisoning him. Exactly. But then
*  when he tries to commit suicide, he's unable to. Exactly. Oh my god. How strange. And so outside of
*  Pompeii, is there any other evidence? And how would you go about finding it? Like,
*  say if you want to continue the search, where would you look? I mean, it opens up a whole
*  world of possibilities now that people, I mean, I wrote this as kind of, I call them the initial
*  archeobotanical blips on the radar. So between this ergatized beer and this potentially psychedelic
*  wine, there's lots of different places to look. If you're trying to prove this psychedelic hypothesis
*  within paleo-christianity, you're looking for a place where the Dionysian mysteries
*  bumped up against the Christian mysteries. And that's all over the place. So back in Galilee,
*  for example, Dionysus, there's a whole myth around Dionysus and his birth, and different authors
*  place his birth in different places. One of the places they place his birth is a city called
*  Schythopolis. Schythopolis was like the capital of the Decaeopolis, this 10-city part of the eastern
*  Mediterranean. From Nazareth to Schythopolis today is 40 minutes door to door, Nazareth where
*  Jesus grows up. So Schythopolis has this northern cemetery where you do find artifacts that relate
*  both to the pagan Dionysian mysteries and some Christian artifacts. So a place like that would
*  be ripe for further investigation. Or in Ephesus, you have like the Grotto of the Seven Sleepers,
*  another place where the pagan mysteries bumped up against the Christian mysteries. One of the best
*  places is Rome and the catacombs, which is why I spent so much time going through the catacombs
*  looking for evidence of these essentially funerary rituals where people were celebrating with the
*  dead using the sacramental wine in the very earliest versions of the myth. And is there any
*  scripture, any text that are describing what they were doing when they were going through these
*  rituals, these funeral rituals? I mean, there's a few things we have. So the funerary, for the
*  Christians, it's called the refrigarium. The refrigarium in Latin means like a chill out.
*  And there's a very respectable scholar, Ramsey McMullen, he's considered one of the
*  the premier authorities of the ancient Roman world. He describes the refrigarium as a place
*  where the dead themselves participate. And it's where the dead basically come back to life.
*  In the Roman world, you would never leave the dead alone. Think of it like a
*  funerary ritual in Mexico, for example, when the family goes to visit the graves
*  of the ancestors. There was a very similar principle in the ancient Roman world that carried over
*  into Christianity. And so we know the refrigarium existed. The big question is if the wine drunk at
*  the refrigarium was similar to the wine of the early Christian Eucharist. And when you look through
*  these catacombs, you find really crazy stuff to suggest that in fact the two could coexist.
*  Wow, here we go. These images. Now the book's out, the book's done. Your thing now is obviously
*  promoting this and getting the word out. But do you have in your mind of following up on this
*  research? Now that the door is opened and now that people are aware of this, it seems like you're,
*  first of all, I believe you're going to get help. People are going to be interested in continuing
*  this research and contributing to this research. Where do you go from here?
*  I want to dedicate my life to this for the next 10 years.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Wow. How does PJ feel about that?
*  I don't think PJ's too happy.
*  No? What if this sells really like gangbusters?
*  We need to take you down to the Amazon, Brian, and you need to have an encounter with Mother
*  Ayahuasca.
*  Or you could just go to Santa Cruz.
*  There's something about that rainforest though.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  It really is a special setting for this experience. But I think it would be interesting, Brian,
*  having written this as a scientific and an academic and a research exercise to then go on
*  to see what your personal experience is and how that resonates with what you've learned as a
*  scientific investigator.
*  Even if you wanted to do it in a clinical setting like Rick Strassman did when he had these FDA
*  approved studies for DMT, the spirit molecule, just anything. Anything where you could tap into
*  that world. Because I guarantee you, you're going to come back eyes wide like those ladies in that
*  drawing. And you're going to be like, oh, okay. It's fascinating to me when you talk to someone
*  who is a psychedelic virgin. Because you almost feel jealous. Do you feel the same way, Graham?
*  Yeah, absolutely. It would be nice to know that that experience lay ahead of us.
*  And we haven't had it yet. But at the same time, you can learn to work with these substances.
*  They can be overwhelming at first. And with more careful use of these substances, you begin to
*  manage them better. Not always, but usually.
*  So when you say you want to do this and dedicate your life for the next 10 years,
*  do you have multiple books in mind? What is your thought?
*  So with this, my dream is to see this on the screen. I think there's so many visual elements here.
*  I think that...
*  What's up, Jamie?
*  Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay, sorry.
*  So I think the best way that... I mean, my dream is to see this on the screen. So I've been talking
*  to a couple of development teams, a couple of production companies. One is Anonymous Content
*  in LA and Six West Media in New York. Together, we're developing a documentary series that adapts
*  this, everything we've talked about for like a first season. But there's really multiple seasons
*  here because there's so much evidence that's never been looked at. And so it's taking the very best
*  of the archeochemistry and the very best of the on-in-the-field archeology, combining all the
*  linguistic evidence and the symbology and iconography and putting it together to find
*  once and for all the smoking gun for the use of a psychedelic Eucharist in antiquity.
*  So are you... Do you have a place where you're bringing this?
*  We are just about to pitch this, as a matter of fact.
*  Oh, Netflix, where you at? Yeah, listen, I would watch that all day long. I'm really excited.
*  I'm really excited about the whole thing, the whole prospect of it. And I think that it's...
*  I'm just so happy that you became obsessed with it and ignored all the people telling you to not.
*  Me too, man. I mean, it's been a long road. I never thought about psychedelics until I read
*  Supernatural. A lot of weird stuff was happening in my life in 2007, 2008. After I read those
*  initial studies that came out of Hopkins and NYU, of course, I wanted to try psilocybin.
*  And then the mystery just got deeper and deeper. And I realized there was a story to be told here
*  that hadn't been told before. And I think it needed a serious and sober look at this stuff.
*  So I really did spend nights and weekends doing nothing else but this kind of stuff
*  and reading hundreds of books and thousands of journal articles and 12 years of Googling
*  to try and put all these pieces together. And I will say that it covers a lot of ground,
*  but you don't need to know anything about history or archaeology, let alone archaeobotany or
*  archaeochemistry or psychopharmacology or biblical studies or paleoanthropology to appreciate this,
*  because I kind of take it one step at a time from the very beginning and show you every piece of
*  evidence that, I mean, as a virgin, did convince me that this is at least worth a sober look from
*  the scientific community. Well, I hope two things. Next time I talk to you, we're promoting this
*  television show. And you can tell me about your psychedelic experience that you had with Graham.
*  Did I agree to this? Yes, you agreed to it. You signed up. You signed up, bro.
*  And Graham, hopefully next time we communicate, it'll actually be in the flesh when somebody works
*  out this COVID nonsense. I hope so. Can I just mention, we've not talked about my book, but
*  this is the hardback of America Before, which we talked about the last time I was on your show.
*  And America Before has been in hardback for the past 18 months, but it's coming out in paperback
*  29th of September 2020 at a much reduced price. And I hope that people who've not been able to
*  access the hardback will be able to have a look at it in the paperback. I mean, we had an amazing
*  conversation the last time I was on your show. And before that, we had the drama with Michael
*  Shermer. And Randall Carson was present and that guy, Mark Defante came in by telephone.
*  I want to pay tribute to Michael Shermer. You may have noticed this, Joe, that Michael put out a
*  tweet saying that he was going to have to reconsider his essentially, I'm paraphrasing,
*  he was going to have to reconsider his prior attitude to my work in the light of new evidence
*  about the Younger Dryas impact catastrophe that in my view, 12,000 years ago or so,
*  lost us a whole civilization. It takes a lot to admit that one may have been wrong. And I'm glad
*  that Michael had the courage to put that tweet out there. Yeah, I am as well. Kudos to him and
*  kudos to you and to Randall Carlson as well because those two conversations that we had
*  about that are absolutely some of my favorite conversations of all time. It's obvious that
*  something happened and all the pieces, much like this in this conversation about spiked wine and
*  drugs, it all makes sense. It all fits into place. And that we are a species with amnesia and that
*  we need to rediscover our past. And there's a curious resonance with the way that things
*  are in the modern world, just as I have come to mistrust history, to mistrust the history that
*  is taught to us in schools and universities, no longer to accept at face value the opinions
*  of so-called experts in the field. So in the modern world today, many people are learning to
*  mistrust institutions that have long gone unquestioned, whether it's government or whether
*  it's science. People are beginning to think for themselves. And I think there's an intriguing
*  resonance between recovering our lost past and regaining sovereignty over ourselves in a modern
*  world that is struggling very hard to turn us all into children and rest all responsibility in
*  government. A huge mistake. Governments are there to serve us. They are not there to rule us. They
*  are not there to tell us what to do. And I'm glad that people are waking up to this.
*  Here, here. That's an excellent way to end this. Thank you, Graham. I love you. I appreciate you
*  very much. I wish you were here right now. I'd give you a big hug. And thank you, Brian.
*  I'd give you a hug back.
*  Thank you. All right. Thank you guys. And thank you everybody listening. Bye-bye.
*  Bye.
