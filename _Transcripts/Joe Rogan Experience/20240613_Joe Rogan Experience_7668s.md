# Joe Rogan Experience #2164 - Action Bronson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfeCwj3Bdoc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  My man.
*  Damn.
*  What a day.
*  I mean it's a joy to spend time with you.
*  We had a good fucking time today.
*  We had a good time today.
*  Got a nice workout in.
*  Went to some Egyptian barbecue.
*  KG? Is it KG BBQ?
*  KG BBQ, yeah.
*  I'd seen YouTube videos about them.
*  What an interesting story.
*  Dudes living in Cairo.
*  It's a banker.
*  It always starts off like that.
*  I told you there's like architect, this, that.
*  They always have these dreams of culinary.
*  I don't know what the fuck they even call it.
*  But it's like when, like me, I want to be an actor.
*  Or I want to play ball or I want to be a fighter.
*  I want to do what I do.
*  I want to do what I do.
*  We all have these dreams even though stay in the fucking lane.
*  Just stay there.
*  Stop being an idiot.
*  That is a thing, right?
*  People always want to do a thing that they're not doing.
*  I like hard labor.
*  Really?
*  I do.
*  Because I do a lot of like fun.
*  Everyone thinks that my job is fun.
*  And it is.
*  There's no doubt.
*  That's why I like to get in the kitchen.
*  Want some coffee?
*  Nah, I'm good.
*  I got this espresso.
*  I'm fucking loose-eat-out.
*  I'm doing things I've never done before.
*  I'm like a little fucking floozy right now.
*  We got you in a sauna.
*  We got you in a cold plunge.
*  Got you a loose-eat.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  200 degrees in the sauna, my ribs are ready to be eaten.
*  I don't even know how long.
*  The first time it was 10 minutes.
*  But the second time seemed longer.
*  Well, the second time was easier though, right?
*  Because you're coming out of the cold.
*  Yeah.
*  A little easier.
*  I think we did another 10 after the cold just to bring you back to base.
*  There's a feeling that you get when you go from the cold to the hot that is like wonderful.
*  It's like psychedelic.
*  It's like...
*  I was standing there in the towel for 30 minutes.
*  Just the towel.
*  No socks on.
*  No nothing.
*  Just standing there looking like, man, that was fucking sick.
*  Yeah.
*  No, because I never did the cold plunge.
*  And I did it.
*  Hopped out.
*  I was like, nah, nah, nah.
*  Get back in.
*  That's what I needed.
*  I needed the motivation to be put back in.
*  And that really gave me the benefits from everything, I think.
*  It is really all battling with this part of your brain that says, get out now.
*  That's all it is.
*  And you have to learn how to conquer that part of your brain.
*  You don't ever really conquer it.
*  You just silence it.
*  It's always there.
*  But you know you're only going to do three minutes.
*  Even if you're only going to do three minutes, it's like your body's like, fuck.
*  How many minutes are we in now?
*  One minute 20?
*  Oh my God.
*  We're not even halfway there.
*  And if you let that anxiety spiral out, much like in life, much like when people have problems
*  in life, you let that anxiety spiral out and everything gets way worse.
*  Like, when you're in that situation, you just have to say, this is what I'm doing.
*  This is just what I'm doing.
*  And I'm going to do this for three minutes.
*  And there's no ifs, ands, or buts.
*  And I've done it before.
*  I know I can do it again.
*  I know it sucks.
*  Just do it.
*  But when I first did it, the first time I got it, I was like, oh, oh, oh.
*  I made it a minute and 20 seconds, I think.
*  And I was like, I got to get the fuck out.
*  I can't handle it.
*  It's too much.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, but a lot of it is your mind.
*  It's not really the reaction that your body has to it.
*  The reaction to your body has is really only like a mild discomfort.
*  It's your brain freaking you out.
*  You've got to get out now.
*  And it starts just like trying to move your body out.
*  Your anxiety just kicks in like, wah.
*  Yeah.
*  At 55 seconds, I was ready to fucking jump out.
*  There was nothing left in me.
*  Yeah.
*  But that was a good start, I think.
*  I think that was the start to a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  I need to take care of myself, Joe.
*  I'm not.
*  Well, you have in the past.
*  You have in the past.
*  You made a big jump when you had one of your babies, one of your kids.
*  You just decided, I am going to get fit now.
*  And you lost a ton of weight.
*  You lost a ton of weight.
*  You got real healthy.
*  You started working out all the time.
*  And you and I worked out together at the On It gym.
*  And I was like, dude, puts in work.
*  That was real.
*  That was like a real workout.
*  You know, you would obviously have been working out a lot.
*  Because John Wolf, who's the master.
*  Love him.
*  The master, like one of the best trainers on earth.
*  He put us through this workout.
*  That's a fucking serious workout, man.
*  Serious kettlebells.
*  Shit, mobility shit.
*  All these different body weight things.
*  I think we did bear crawls.
*  We did a lot of shit.
*  I was drenched, drenched during the fucking stretch.
*  Just during the warm up stretch.
*  I was fucking, it was harder than anything for me.
*  Sometimes the stretching and putting yourself in those like.
*  Well, John targets unique area.
*  Like he's big on hip strength and hip flexibility.
*  So he has you doing all these hip exercises with your legs up near and sort of.
*  And you're like, whoa, I never do anything like this.
*  Like this is hard to do.
*  I haven't done it since him.
*  I need to get back on that.
*  Because those are the types of things that I want to work with a core specialist like him.
*  I need the core work.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, you see, we got the pushing and this and that.
*  You're very strong.
*  That stuff is kind of easy for us, like the pushing and shit.
*  But for me, I need more core work.
*  Right.
*  I need to stabilize this midsection.
*  I've done yoga.
*  I've done yoga.
*  I've done yoga.
*  Yoga is the ultimate.
*  Yoga out of all those things like keeping your body balanced and having strength and
*  flexibility, yoga is the king.
*  I can't stay on that kick.
*  I don't know.
*  I need I need some animal shit.
*  Yeah, I also need I know what I need for my body is probably yoga.
*  But what I want to do is animal shit.
*  Animal shit makes you feel better.
*  It does.
*  It makes me feel more manly.
*  I see why you're doing yoga.
*  It's a 60 pound hammer for fuck's sake wrapped in leather.
*  Yeah, that feels fucking sick to manhandle that.
*  Yeah, it's hard.
*  Those are so hard to move around.
*  Like we were talking today about those clubs that the club I use is only 20 pounds, which
*  doesn't seem like a lot of weight.
*  But when you got it out in front of you and doing these things, it's fucking hard to do
*  stabilizing 20 pounds is still stable.
*  It's still stable.
*  It's still stable.
*  It's still stable.
*  It's still stable.
*  It's fucking hard to do.
*  Stabilizing 20 pounds is still stable as in 20 pounds.
*  And you need those those front that move that you were doing that just that's bulletproofing
*  all those little muscles around your shoulder area and your lat and everything.
*  Yeah, and I was telling you too, it's really good for archery.
*  You know, because like a lot of it is extending your arm straight out.
*  You know, when you're doing a shield cast, you're going around your head and you're extending
*  your arm out.
*  It's like it's such a weird way to move your muscles that when you're doing it, you're
*  like, whoa, why don't I do this more often?
*  Like, why am I bad at this?
*  How am I?
*  How am I so good at this?
*  So good at like lifting things up over my head.
*  But anything gets sideways and around them all squirrely with 20 pounds.
*  It's that's stupid.
*  Like when I do those little things, it's humbling.
*  You feel like such a bitch.
*  Yes.
*  15 pounds.
*  What are we doing?
*  They laugh.
*  I laugh at myself.
*  I look like an idiot.
*  But those are the types of things I need to warm up to be able to push some heavy shit.
*  Well, it's just like also just to balance out your body.
*  You know, we were talking about that Ben Patrick gentleman who created that knees over toes
*  stuff.
*  And we were doing the Nordic curls today.
*  And I was saying like when I first did that, I couldn't even do one.
*  I couldn't do one.
*  And I was shocked.
*  I was like, I have pretty strong legs, like from kicking and stuff.
*  Like, why can't I lift myself up on my legs?
*  Couldn't even do one.
*  It's a lot of pressure on the knee.
*  It just felt weird.
*  Why am I so weak this way?
*  It's like I would have thought that I would be able to lift myself up easy, just like
*  I can lift myself up with my abs if I'm sitting down.
*  I thought that's not going to be hard.
*  I thought I was going to do it easily.
*  And then when I got into the apparatus, I realized that I'm a fucking I'm very weak
*  in that area.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like what Ben Patrick talks about is strengthening all of these areas.
*  It's not a sexy exercise to do like tib raises.
*  You know, you got weight on your foot and you're raising your toes up towards your knees.
*  But let's be honest, if you're a real motherfucker, you know that that's what makes the leg look good.
*  That's what makes the leg look strong is that tib.
*  Big, thick muscles down there.
*  When you flex your toe up and that thing pops out in the front of the shin, that looks fire.
*  It does.
*  That's like some flex.
*  That's like some muscular development.
*  That's all I wanted was that tib work.
*  There's something that's super impressive about dudes with big ass calves.
*  Natural ones too.
*  Like you can't get them to a diamond if they weren't a diamond in the beginning.
*  They'll get nice, but they'll never be naturally diamond.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You know, when you see like my boy, Mikey Spears, he works out.
*  He's you know, he's in decent shape now.
*  He's got himself together.
*  But my fucking Lord, this calf, the calf on this fucking kid is unbelievable.
*  It's like a horse calf.
*  Yeah, Mark Hunt, who used to fight in the UFC, he has calves like shoulders, like two shoulders, like your whole body.
*  They're so big.
*  That's a different species of human being though, Samoas.
*  Oh my God.
*  Mark Hunt, he was one of the baddest motherfuckers to ever do it.
*  You ever watch him in K-1 back in the kickbox?
*  Of course.
*  That dude won the K-1 Grand Prix.
*  Pretty nuts.
*  That is an accomplishment over everything else in stand up combat sports.
*  Other than like MMA championships, K-1 Grand Prix was like Alistair Overeem won that.
*  And you think about the guys that are fighting back like Peter Ernst, Ernesto Loost, Mr. Perfect.
*  Like damn.
*  And Mark Hunt won that.
*  Like that's how good Mark Hunt was.
*  Mark Hunt just beat some undefeated boxer in Australia.
*  He won the match?
*  He knocked the dude out.
*  Of course.
*  It was a fight where he was like, it was Mark Hunt has this big name.
*  This guy's this undefeated up and coming boxer and he's really young.
*  And Mark Hunt's like 40 something.
*  He's 50.
*  Bro, you got to see this fight.
*  It's crazy.
*  This is how good Mark Hunt is.
*  And that was recent.
*  Recent.
*  Yeah, because I saw him talking about it.
*  Like within a year.
*  Yeah.
*  Within a year or so, right Jamie?
*  Something like that?
*  After January, does that sound right?
*  I think that's it.
*  So yeah.
*  So within the year.
*  And bro, it was a crazy fight.
*  And the guy was good too.
*  The guy's good.
*  He's a good fighter.
*  And they were building this guy up.
*  And I think, you know, when boxing is like, they're very careful about how they match
*  fighters up, you know, and it's really intelligent.
*  I think if it's done correctly, if you test them correctly along the way and you give
*  them fights, they can win and they keep getting better.
*  But the UFC does not do that.
*  They feed you to the wolves.
*  UFC is like doggy dog.
*  This is a wolf farm.
*  All right.
*  If you're not a wolf, we don't build you into a wolf.
*  Like tell me when you're ready to be a wolf.
*  You know, like you could get a guy like.
*  John Jones right off the bat, you know, 21 years old, just smoking people.
*  Like that's your first fight in the UFC.
*  His fight, your fight.
*  Fuck.
*  I watched that first fight while I was working in the kitchen on Spike TV.
*  I watched from the debut of John Jones.
*  Yeah.
*  Till now.
*  Yeah, man.
*  If you run into a special talent like that, you know, John's the youngest ever UFC champion.
*  That's right.
*  And he beat a legend.
*  Mauricio Shogun Hua in Jersey.
*  Demolished.
*  And by the way, captured a burglar the day of the fight.
*  That day?
*  Yeah, that day.
*  Chase some dude down to like, I think, snatch some lady's purse or something.
*  Tackle the dude.
*  Yeah.
*  So we'll get to that.
*  But this is Mark Hunt.
*  He looks good.
*  And this young kid is like this.
*  Oh, look at the bro.
*  That right hand.
*  Come on, son.
*  Bro, Mark Hunt's been putting it on people since the 90s.
*  He stopped this dude.
*  A lot of my boys are from New Zealand.
*  And they used to tell me their stories of Mark Hunt being a fucking menace on K Road.
*  Oh, bro.
*  The menace of K Road, Mark Hunt.
*  Can you imagine getting a street fight with Mark Hunt?
*  Nah, man.
*  Are you fucking kidding me?
*  Definitely not.
*  You just, my bad guy.
*  Bro, he ate a Merko Krokop head kick.
*  It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
*  Was it left or right?
*  Left.
*  Left high kick.
*  Nobody eats a Merko Krokop head kick.
*  It was back when Merko was allowed to wear shoes.
*  So this is the pride days.
*  He kicked him in the face with shoes?
*  He kicked him in the face with wrestling shoes on, son.
*  No, he didn't have the wrestling shoes on.
*  I lied.
*  Didn't he have one fight with, no, I made that up.
*  I don't think he had one fight with, I think he always went barefoot.
*  But like, you gotta see when he eats one of these high kicks.
*  And Merko has the best left high kick other than Leon Edwards, like, of all time.
*  It may be better than Leon Edwards because he's so big.
*  Yeah, he's massive.
*  He eats it.
*  He ate a couple of them, dude.
*  He ate one square on the noggin.
*  Mark Hunt looks fast, too.
*  The transitions to the knee are nice.
*  Yeah, Mark Hunt always carried around a lot of body fat, but he moved very well.
*  And he has, like, lethal combinations.
*  Like, his combinations are very complex.
*  He goes under your ribs, over the top.
*  Look at that, like David Tua.
*  And his legs are massive, bro.
*  His legs are massive.
*  And he just had not just an iron chin, but like a warrior's mentality.
*  Oh, he got dropped here.
*  Oh, he ate that one.
*  Bro, on the chin.
*  Gets up, though.
*  This is what's crazy.
*  That's the difference between K-1 and MMA, right?
*  Laughing, look at that.
*  He's like, fuck it.
*  Bro, he got clean caught.
*  Clean caught by one of the, and he got hit again, by one of the most dangerous strikers of all time.
*  But you know who put him out, which is even crazy?
*  Melvin Manhoef.
*  Melvin Manhoef, who weighed like 190 pounds, put him out with one punch.
*  Melvin was, you want to talk about like the scariest striker ever in MMA?
*  I think it's Melvin.
*  Ever?
*  He might not have been the best.
*  He might not be like the best technical, like Paheta's probably the most technical.
*  But Melvin was so terrifying, because he would come at you guns blazing with them gladiator shorts on.
*  Look at this.
*  Boom.
*  Oh, man.
*  He dropped Mark Hunt and put him out.
*  Like who the fuck does that?
*  He has kryptonite in that fucking hand.
*  Look at that.
*  Bro, he's so fast.
*  Going backwards, boom, boom.
*  Oh.
*  See if you can find a Melvin Manhoef highlight reel.
*  Oh my lord.
*  This dude, man, this dude was like a demon.
*  He would come at, first of all, super skillful.
*  He's from Mike's Gym, an Amsterdam legendary kickboxing gym, Badahari, came from that gym.
*  So just super skillful, but so fucking ferocious, man.
*  I mean, just such an awesome kickboxer.
*  And just do or die.
*  He either got knocked out or he knocked you out.
*  Oh.
*  And that style was just so fan friendly.
*  Bro, he's chasing people down.
*  He was so dangerous, so dangerous.
*  But, you know, got KO'd too, because his fights were so reckless.
*  Not reckless, skillful.
*  Skillful, but like super aggressive.
*  He lives within the zone.
*  Yeah.
*  He's in that danger zone.
*  And he drags everybody into that.
*  And you might get him.
*  Joe Schilling got him.
*  Robbie Lawler got him.
*  Robbie Lawler got him in a crazy fight where Robbie Lawler was getting the shit kicked out of his legs.
*  And he just uncorked a hammer, just one punch, just one wild right hand, just clip Melvin, and the lights go out.
*  Robbie Lawler's the next level, man.
*  He's such a gentle, like when you meet him also, he's very sweet.
*  He's just like, yo, how are you, man?
*  Did you hear what happened during the Free Palestine marches in New York City?
*  Did you hear what happened?
*  So there was a bus, and the bus was filled with UFC fighters.
*  And there was the Free Palestine thing that was going on.
*  What, they stopped the street?
*  And apparently the bus was trying to make it through before they closed everything off, and the bus didn't.
*  So then they got in front of the bus, and then they started slashing the tires.
*  Oh, shit.
*  The bus was filled with Robbie Lawler and a bunch of other killers.
*  And everybody's like, should we go out with the bus?
*  And Robbie goes, everybody conserve your energy because we're probably going to need it.
*  Just calm. Just like a seal.
*  It's like, we have to fight these people. You're going to need your energy.
*  So Robbie Lawler's like, just sitting there like he's ready to go to a championship fight.
*  Just conserving all his energy.
*  Just fucking getting an arrow ready.
*  He was just telling everybody, just conserve your energy.
*  You imagine if those fucking knuckleheads opened up that door.
*  So this is the Melvin Manhoef-Robbie Lawler fight.
*  So Melvin is just chopping at Robbie's.
*  I mean, look at that. Look at that. One right hand. Boom!
*  And then a left behind.
*  That's what I was throwing at the bag today. Those big overhand rights.
*  I mean, eyes wide open, out cold.
*  But it was that style.
*  Why do you breathe like that when you're knocked out?
*  Well, you're almost dead.
*  Okay.
*  You know, you're almost dead.
*  Makes sense.
*  Yeah, you're getting knocked unconscious.
*  Like someone can then kill you.
*  Like, you know, it's like they've already put you away.
*  Now you're at their mercy.
*  And if someone's just at your mercy.
*  I've seen them doing this before and twitching.
*  But like those deep crazy breaths with the eyes open is fucking scary.
*  Scary. That shit's scary.
*  Those kind of knockouts are fucking terrifying.
*  And how many of them can your body endure?
*  And at what age?
*  This is the real questions.
*  Like maybe you can bounce back from one when you're 18, but when you're 35 you can't.
*  You know, there's a scary.
*  Dudes who take beatings for five rounds, they must get micro, whatever this means, micro concussions.
*  There's no micro about it.
*  That's what I'm saying. They're getting concussion every fucking time.
*  Most likely.
*  How do you recover like that?
*  They get dropped.
*  Well, first of all, they're in insane shape.
*  Like every guy who gets to a five round championship level.
*  Like did you watch that Sean Strickland, Paulo Costa fight?
*  Sure did.
*  But you got to be in bonkers shape to put that pace on a person for three rounds.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Strickland just stays on you, just stays on you.
*  Stays in the gym. That's why. He doesn't fight. All he does is fight.
*  All he does is spar. He's just constantly sparring.
*  That's the only way you get that cardio, correct?
*  I don't know, man, but he has it different than anybody else.
*  He has it different than anybody. Other than Drekas, man.
*  Because Drekas, as big as that, as swole as that motherfucker is, that guy's got cardio.
*  He does.
*  Especially now that he got his nose fixed.
*  Yeah, the first couple of fights he looked like he was gassing,
*  but then he had that nose situation and he looks like a brand new man.
*  Brand new man. Dude, the nose thing, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Did you have him beating Sean?
*  No.
*  It was fucking very...
*  No, I thought Sean won. I thought Sean won by like a round.
*  But I didn't hate it. It wasn't like the worst decision I've ever seen.
*  But it wasn't like if you're going to beat the champion, you know, that's always the thing.
*  Like if you're going to beat the champion, it should like be a clear, decisive win.
*  And I think I would have edged it to Sean, but it was a great fucking fight.
*  Incredible.
*  It was a great... And Drekas is tough as shit, man.
*  That guy's so big. He barely makes sense that he's 185 pounds.
*  I'm like, how the fuck do you get down to 185? Dude, you're huge.
*  230, 225 he probably walks.
*  Big, thick fucker. But he does it just like Alex Pareda did it.
*  Like there's guys that are willing to like really, really torture themselves.
*  Recently I was in the airport. I was leaving Cheetos Fight in Miami when he fought Sean O'Malley.
*  And fucking I seen Alex Pareda and Polino Cruz there.
*  Polino is fucking massive, first off. He's as big as Alex.
*  But man, I've never seen a man that looks like fucking Seghat from Street Fighter before.
*  Exactly. He's a scary individual, bro.
*  Alex is built different. Holy shit.
*  He's built different and his mind's different too.
*  But when you see him out and he's dressed, he's wearing the tight ass pants.
*  It's like some Jean-Claude Van Damme shit.
*  He's looking good. He's a champ. He's the champ.
*  He's the champ. You gotta look like that.
*  Two division champ and just a handful of fights in the UFC.
*  Instant Hall of Famer in my mind.
*  Instant Hall of Famer. It's unbelievable.
*  And he's just different than everybody else in that he's such a specialist.
*  He's not taking nobody down.
*  You never have to worry about him trying to take you down.
*  He's not even interested. He's such a specialist.
*  But that specialist is one of the best specialists ever at that game.
*  You watch him at his peak in glory.
*  Dude, Alex Pareda in glory.
*  Was he at his peak or is he peaking now?
*  Oh, I think he's peaking now as a fighter.
*  But when he was at his peak as a kickboxer, he was putting people into orbit.
*  Pull up Alex Pareda versus Jason Willness.
*  That left hook is out of control.
*  Bro, everything's out of control. It's scary.
*  The power is just so extraordinary.
*  It's the torque, man. It's that body style.
*  He's just thick and fucking huge. Bastard.
*  Yeah, so Jason Willness who's also a legit world champion,
*  one of the best kickboxers in the world.
*  And Pareda and him fought early. I know, dude.
*  He literally looks like fucking Seguet.
*  He looks like he's street fighter too.
*  Like he's born to do this.
*  But he's such a menace.
*  Because his style is different than anybody you're going to get to imitate in the gym.
*  It's very awkward. You wouldn't teach that style.
*  But the way he's holding his hands out like this.
*  Everything's strange. But it's so effective.
*  And it's just the power is just extraordinary.
*  Even when you block things.
*  Like Jason Willness, he's going to block a high kick.
*  And even though he blocks the high kick, he still gets dropped on his ass.
*  But you got to see the KO after he blocks the high kick.
*  I think it's coming right here.
*  Yeah. So he's setting it up. Boom.
*  Wow. The velocity you get on that fucking length of leg.
*  Yeah. And the density, dude.
*  That's what I'm saying. Coming from playing football, my coach would always say,
*  look at them legs. Look at that ass.
*  Yes.
*  Look at how high his fucking ass is.
*  Watch this.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yo, that scissor knee is fucking insanity.
*  He has like a runner's body. Like his ass is up fucking halfway up his back.
*  Yeah. So we got his leg like that. It's like a deer.
*  Well, he's a legit Amazon tribesman.
*  You know, like his people are like legit Amazon warriors.
*  Like that's that guy. Oh my God.
*  That's probably how the great warriors of 500 years ago all looked.
*  You know, they're probably all looking like that guy.
*  Look at that scissor knee. That is insane.
*  He's just so clever too. And you know, he beats Shawn Strickland.
*  He knocks him out one round and then goes and trains with him.
*  He's a gentleman.
*  He's a really fucking nice guy.
*  He seemed like a really nice guy.
*  Who's sweet.
*  Well, that's why he gets mad when like, you know,
*  when Jamal Hill brought out the Stonehenge statue.
*  I mean, he knocks after fucking Jamal, who I like a lot, fucking checked his nuts.
*  Herb, chill for one second.
*  And then he threw that left hook out and oh my God.
*  There's a little bit of a complication with that because Jamal stops and pauses.
*  And when he stops and pauses, Alex hops in twice and he closes the distance.
*  And so when they restart, it was a little it was a little complicated because what happened was.
*  Should Herb back off then or he should he should stop it?
*  Look, I'm not a referee and I think Herb's the best in the business.
*  So I'm not going to like correct him in any way ever.
*  But what I think was going on in Jamal's mind is Jamal kicks him in the nuts.
*  Accidentally, Herb says stop.
*  Herb says stop.
*  And then Alex puts his hand on her and as he and then they restart.
*  Herb is out of the view and restarts it.
*  And when he restarts it, Alex catches him with a left foot.
*  Jamal's out of position from Jamal's perspective.
*  Jamal stiffened his legs up.
*  He relaxed.
*  He said sorry.
*  And then he goes like this.
*  You good?
*  And then and then Alex has his hand on the guy's forearm moves in and they reengage.
*  But he's closed the distance now, like significantly.
*  And there's a danger zone with Paheta.
*  It's anywhere near his hands.
*  Right there.
*  You can't take but one.
*  Seven feet.
*  You can't take but one.
*  They're just two.
*  It's just crazy power.
*  And you know, there's guys that have been gone like Bruno.
*  Bruno Silva went three rounds with them.
*  He survived.
*  He got a beating.
*  Yeah, but he's a good striker.
*  But it was a good fight.
*  So here's what happens.
*  There's the nut shot and it's, you know.
*  I think it was so shockingly spectacular.
*  Right there.
*  Relax.
*  His legs stiffen up.
*  And he closes the distance.
*  But he's already closed the distance.
*  Already stepping.
*  Herb has said stop.
*  So let's watch it again.
*  That first initial bunny hop within.
*  So watch this.
*  There's the nut shot.
*  And he goes, sorry.
*  He completely stiffens up, stands up straight.
*  Let's him close the distance.
*  See?
*  The distance is much different now when he puts his hand on Herb.
*  Now he's right in front of him.
*  So Jamal was not letting him stand that close to him before.
*  Then he clips him.
*  Boom, it drops him.
*  Jamal was fighting him on the outside.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that one little step in changed the whole game.
*  Exactly.
*  And in Jamal's eyes, he had gotten a feeling of the dude's rhythm and where the danger was.
*  Right there.
*  Boom, boom.
*  But see how he's already closed the distance.
*  Oh yeah, he's already in.
*  He's already there.
*  Yeah, it's just, it's the thing.
*  I didn't actually realize that until just now.
*  It doesn't mean Pejada couldn't have caught him like that at any moment in the fight.
*  Because he 100% can catch anybody alive at any moment in the fight with that guy.
*  Bang!
*  And then you're in deep shit.
*  But in that instance, Jamal Hill actually has a point.
*  And it's just, referee in fights is chaos.
*  Like they're trying to make a decision in the moment.
*  He says, I'm fine.
*  Okay, restart it.
*  But do you recognize that you said stop?
*  And when you say stop, are you supposed to separate them?
*  And then are you supposed to bring them back together to fight again?
*  Or are you going to let them close the distance?
*  Because if you let them close the distance.
*  Separate them and then bring them, right?
*  Yeah, I think.
*  But it's one of those things where it's like, okay, you guys are okay?
*  You're both okay?
*  All right, go ahead and fight.
*  Which makes sense too.
*  But I think.
*  It was a tough spot.
*  With Jamal's mind, all of a sudden the focus is gone.
*  There's a confusion.
*  Are we fighting?
*  We're not fighting?
*  We're going back?
*  All right, we're back.
*  You know?
*  For sure.
*  You can see that.
*  Says I'm sorry.
*  I kicked you in the nuts.
*  You're good.
*  Gives you the thumbs up.
*  Gentlemen, stand straight up.
*  Relaxed posture.
*  Not looking like he's fighting at all.
*  Alex is like, fuck you.
*  He sneaks in.
*  Alex is like, fuck you.
*  So it's like, it's Alex's job to say fuck you and close the.
*  If he can get away with doing that, his job is to get a hold of you.
*  Right?
*  And you're trying to allow him to come at you and take angles and kick his legs and
*  pick him apart on the outside and never let him get that close to you where he can clip
*  you with one of them left hooks.
*  So that's how it happened.
*  That shit's dangerous right there.
*  That's a dangerous profession.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Do these refs make any money?
*  Is Herb Dean rich?
*  I do not know.
*  I have never asked.
*  Are these dudes making any type of money?
*  Because they got a lot of fucking pressure on them.
*  They have a lot of pressure on them.
*  They have a lot of pressure.
*  They also don't have to really like answer for themselves also.
*  But sometimes they do answer for themselves.
*  Like if there's a question or something really like egregious.
*  Yeah, there was one this weekend.
*  Jared Cananier and Nasruddin Imamov.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fight was stopped.
*  And Jason Herzog, who's the referee, is a really good, really, really good referee.
*  Fucking excellent referee.
*  I just think he made a mistake.
*  I think sometimes guys make mistakes and maybe he thought Jared was out and maybe he thought he was out on his feet.
*  And he was seeing that he's going to get hit again.
*  And then when he makes the call, all of a sudden Jared recovers.
*  It happens.
*  Don't you get flash knocked out and then you recover as you're as he's breaking it up.
*  You understand what's happening.
*  Like, no, no, no.
*  And in his mind, he might have thought that Jared had gotten to the point of helplessness and he was going to separate and Jared was going to crumble, which could happen.
*  He could have just crumbled, could have just fell apart.
*  But he definitely didn't.
*  So when he stopped it, Jared was like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  Like, I'm OK.
*  I can still move.
*  I can get this guy back.
*  He's going to run out of gas.
*  Like, this is part of fighting.
*  So tough ones out there.
*  It's part of fighting because guys have moments in a fight where they turn on the gas and then sometimes the guys come back from that.
*  For sure.
*  Like, I'm sure you've seen Mickey Ward and Arturo Gatti.
*  Many, many times.
*  Perfect example.
*  Those fights are crazy, man.
*  Mickey Ward is putting it on Arturo Gatti.
*  Just put it on him.
*  Drops him with a liver shot.
*  Who always took fucking damage.
*  Yes.
*  He got battered a lot.
*  They both did.
*  Yeah.
*  And in those fights, oh my God.
*  Legendary fights.
*  Oh my God.
*  But those fights, like, you could have come close to stopping that a couple of times if you were like an overzealous referee.
*  But then there wouldn't be these legendary fucking fights.
*  Right.
*  But then there's the other.
*  Well, in that case.
*  Yeah, obviously now, you know, I'm sure Mickey doesn't speak well.
*  I don't know.
*  I talked to him once.
*  Said hi to him once.
*  But does he like, not drool, but you know, like, he has like a draw.
*  But some guys definitely do.
*  Of course.
*  Some guys get it real, like, you know, some guys get it.
*  Like Joe Frazier in the end had it so bad.
*  Evander got it.
*  Yeah.
*  Does he have it now?
*  He doesn't sound like he's all there.
*  How his body might be there, but it doesn't seem like his speech is there.
*  How can you be?
*  You know, how can you keep getting repeatedly punched in the head, you know, and not have it damage your head?
*  You know, if you drink whiskey every day, you're going to get a fucked up liver.
*  You know, it's just if you're getting punched in the head all of the time, that can't be good.
*  You know, for me, I, I like to protect this bod of mine.
*  I just want to, you know, I want to make it more healthy.
*  That's what I really want to do.
*  I have friends that spar and they really like sparring and I like you.
*  You're a professional.
*  You have a professional.
*  Just regular dudes that like some fight club.
*  You just want to get a little adrenaline.
*  Yeah, but they're sparring and they're 46.
*  You're getting punched in the face.
*  What are you doing?
*  Don't do that.
*  Sometimes it takes a while to get those chops.
*  It'll take a long time if you start if you're 46.
*  It takes a minute.
*  You have to be a weird athlete to get really good at striking at 46.
*  If you've never done anything and then you step in and now you're sparring guys and you're good at 46,
*  you'd have to be like a weird athlete.
*  You'd have to be like some dude who could just do any gymnastics, basketball, baseball.
*  You can do anything.
*  He just knows how to move his body.
*  I feel like that could be me.
*  I like training, man.
*  I said I want to grapple somebody.
*  You were saying that.
*  I would do a celebrity grappling even though it's like, so the fucking celebrity, just a grappling.
*  As long as there's no heel hooks.
*  No heel hooks.
*  Grab it.
*  This is not Jiu Jitsu.
*  This is grappling.
*  I want to do collegiate style and mixed with Roman Greco.
*  Do you really?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I want to fucking throw somebody around for sure.
*  I want to fucking submit somebody very badly.
*  Every day I practice submitting a fucking sandbag.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah, every day.
*  Do you ever take Jiu Jitsu classes?
*  I did a couple of times, but I've been offered to go where my son goes, but I don't know, man.
*  Get in there.
*  Yeah.
*  Get in there.
*  Get in there.
*  I only want to learn top pressure.
*  That's it?
*  I'm never going to be on the fucking bottom, dog.
*  Fuck that.
*  Only top.
*  Aggressive top.
*  Well, what are you going to do to get?
*  I don't know.
*  You got to learn how to get off the bottom at least.
*  That's the hardest thing to do.
*  If someone's laying on me, it fucking sucks.
*  It's very difficult.
*  It's hard.
*  You have to pinch.
*  You have to pinch them.
*  You're going to have to learn how to get out.
*  Are you allowed to pinch?
*  No.
*  I saw a dude recently bit a dude in the UFC.
*  I saw that.
*  And so the dude got a tattoo of the guy's bite on his arm, which is hilarious.
*  That's a fucking deep bite.
*  Ooh, deep.
*  That was in the, this spot here, that thin skin, he could have broke fucking skin and
*  it could have bled bad.
*  Oh, it's real dangerous.
*  That's disgusting, bro.
*  Like teeth, like people's mouths are so nasty.
*  It's the worst shit in the world.
*  We give people awful infections.
*  Look at this guy.
*  What does it say?
*  I got fucking bit?
*  What's the full tattoo?
*  I got fucking bit bonus.
*  Oh, I got the bonus, right?
*  Well, they disqualified the guy he was fighting and he got the win bonus.
*  It was a decent fight.
*  He was definitely winning though.
*  Yes.
*  I think the dude was trying to take him down and he couldn't take him down and he bit his
*  arm from behind.
*  It was just like fucking so animal.
*  That's so crazy that people get to that state where they're like, I'm fucking, just fucking
*  like Tyson and Holyfield.
*  I'm saying when you're frustrated, you get put in a position you can't get out.
*  Damn, look at that bite too.
*  That's a crazy bite.
*  Was he wearing a fucking mouth guard or did he throw it out of his mouth?
*  What the fuck is that?
*  That looks like it.
*  That looks like a baby piranha.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, you know what it is?
*  It's a mouth guard probably on one side, but not on the other.
*  So wait, you just wear one piece?
*  You don't do the double?
*  I don't think anybody uses the double.
*  That shock guard that we used to wear in football?
*  Yeah.
*  I think the problem with that is it restricts your breathing too much.
*  Yeah, true.
*  So most guys just wear one on the top.
*  There were some boxers back in the day that would wear the double.
*  It would be crazy.
*  They had this crazy mouth.
*  Yeah, like that, of course.
*  And they had holes like this and they'd be fighting with this double.
*  But I think ultimately everybody kind of decided that that just takes out too much wind.
*  Break your nose, it's over.
*  No, it's-
*  How are you going to fucking breathe if you break your nose in that big ass football mouth
*  guard?
*  Yeah, that mouth guard sucks.
*  I don't think you could do that.
*  It's like, have you ever done one of those breath trainers?
*  We breathe through something.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Like the Boss Rootin one?
*  Yep.
*  It's pretty much what they give you after surgery, where they put the fuck in the ball,
*  you have to keep the ball in the middle.
*  Right.
*  And he made a thing.
*  Boss Rootin did.
*  He made a waist trainer?
*  Not a waist trainer, a fucking breath trainer?
*  Yes, Boss Rootin did, yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's really good.
*  It's got a bunch of different filters.
*  So you have one where it's wide open.
*  Like lung restrictions?
*  Yeah.
*  There's different levels of lung restriction or air restriction.
*  It's basically like you're breathing air through a smaller and smaller hole and it just like
*  fits in your mouth.
*  And it's like contracting your diaphragm muscles.
*  It's just really like, it's like breathing exercises but almost like with weights.
*  I mean, the world is incredible.
*  Yeah.
*  Just keep like all these little micro workouts for fucking organs and muscles.
*  I love this.
*  I love this.
*  I love to learn about these things.
*  I'm going to order one.
*  Does he have them ready?
*  Are they available?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  What is it called?
*  What's Boss' mouth?
*  I love fucking Boss Rootin.
*  He's the man.
*  Bro.
*  Those early videos of him showing you how to fucking win a bar fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Incredible.
*  Those things are things of legend.
*  And he's another guy.
*  If you met him, you would have no idea.
*  You would think he's the nicest.
*  What does he do?
*  Is he a banker?
*  He's just, there it is.
*  The O2 trainer.
*  That's right.
*  The O2 trainer 2.0, new and improved.
*  You wear that running?
*  No, no, no.
*  Or just wherever.
*  You just do it for breathing exercises.
*  They have like outlines of like different ways to do it.
*  Boss has videos that he's put out there.
*  And you know, I think they probably have a frequently asked questions.
*  You look ridiculous, but I'm sure it works.
*  Yeah, there he is.
*  Boss and me talking about it.
*  It's real.
*  I use it.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah, it's fun.
*  He told me not to do it in the cold plunge though.
*  He's like, Joe, it's Boss.
*  Listen.
*  People apparently black out, so don't do it in the cold plunge.
*  I would imagine like if you were in the cold plunge, you're freezing and then you're also
*  restricting your breathing and you get like.
*  I could attest.
*  Things get wacky.
*  You lose your breath immediately, man.
*  I fucking could not handle that.
*  Yeah, if you had that thing in your mouth too.
*  You feel like you're getting choked.
*  Super ultra freak out.
*  Nah.
*  I mean, you use all these different fucking, these different things that people invent.
*  I think, by the way, I feel like an asshole sometimes when I come on here.
*  Terrence Howard.
*  I don't even know what to say.
*  I was like Googling shit to talk about after that.
*  What the fuck?
*  What in the actual fuck?
*  I understand it though.
*  I kind of understand it.
*  I understand.
*  I mean, it made sense.
*  To me, he's making me believe.
*  He's way too smart to just be making everything up.
*  Like this, there's no way he's just me.
*  He's a lunatic.
*  You can't just lie.
*  You can't just come up on that.
*  I'm like, I don't think that's correct.
*  He knows too much.
*  So is he correct?
*  I don't know.
*  And then that's so that's what has what has to happen is Terrence Howard has to sit down with someone who's an academic, someone who's got a Ph.D.
*  in whatever discipline they're talking about, and they can have a discussion and you can see what he really knows and just what he can say to me.
*  Right.
*  To me, it all makes sense.
*  But I'm a moron.
*  No, you're not.
*  But if you're talking to a mathematician or if you're talking to a physicist, someone who actually can understand what these computations mean and what he's trying to say about one plus one or one multiplied by one can't be like no mathematics.
*  Everything is bullshit.
*  I believe that.
*  I wasn't I wasn't good in algebra.
*  I'm I see I see it more in a linear way, not a linear way, a different way than him, like more similarly to him.
*  Right.
*  Well, I would imagine that there's probably more to all all these things.
*  Those fucking toys.
*  He made the figures.
*  Even our mathematics is brilliant as the people are who have created all the formulas that everyone's studying.
*  I would imagine that in the future, they're going to have even better methods of figuring things out and that all these things are going to evolve, that they're not perfect and that they're going to just like continue to evolve.
*  And if if we want to get to like what alien civilization looks like when we want to get to like super insane levels of technology where they control all of the atmosphere, they they literally can harness the power of the universe.
*  They literally can harness the power of stars like there's so much work to do.
*  There's so much everybody has to figure out.
*  And if he if Terrence Howard somehow or another, if it's the craziest story ever and Terrence Howard is like literally one of the smartest guys that ever lived.
*  And he's got all these genius ideas and inventions.
*  And even though he seems crazy, it seems just insane that this is coming from an actor.
*  This is from the hustle and flow guy.
*  What?
*  Hey, listen, this is from the Iron Man guy.
*  What?
*  He was in Boomerang back in the day with Eddie Murphy and fucking Sunset Park.
*  He was spaceman.
*  Like he has range.
*  And then he's like a modern day Daniel Day.
*  Yeah, he's a great, great actor.
*  But it's just because he's so smart.
*  And then he's talking about how the periodic table is all fucked up.
*  And this is what's like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
*  What are you doing?
*  How can you do this?
*  I understand about because of music.
*  I understand the way that I feel what he's saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Like stop trying to uncover shit.
*  All these little micro fucking bullshit.
*  What do you mean?
*  Like I said, I'm a fucking idiot.
*  I'm trying to regurgitate what I heard.
*  Like as far as all the elements, the elements in between.
*  Yeah.
*  Like why are they there when they're just...
*  You and I will never explain this in a way that's not hugely frustrating to anyone who really knows it.
*  I can't even remember what I'm trying to say, but you know.
*  Yeah.
*  He's explaining how everything's connected.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And the entire, the whole scale of it.
*  And the way he was showing it like a geometric pattern.
*  And when you look at it like the way he was describing it, you're like, oh wow, that kind of makes more sense.
*  It does make sense.
*  That's it.
*  I mean, it just looks beautiful.
*  That's fire.
*  Oh, Jamie.
*  That's dope art.
*  I need to know if this is true.
*  I'm going to send you this, but it's so cool that I hoped and prayed that it was true and I didn't even want to Google it.
*  But it's that they took these photons.
*  I was trying to find that.
*  Did you see it?
*  I didn't find, I Googled it and couldn't find anything.
*  How could this be fake?
*  Why would they be lying to me, Jamie?
*  Why would they be lying to me, Jamie?
*  It was like, what did they do?
*  There was photons had what?
*  It looked like a yin and yang.
*  I'll tell you what it is.
*  I'll send it to you again.
*  I'll send you the...
*  It's like a very specific thing they did to them.
*  Yeah.
*  But it revealed the yin yang.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  It's quantum entangled photons.
*  So this is what it looks like.
*  That's quantum entangled photons.
*  Now, again, for the record, I am a fucking idiot.
*  Okay.
*  I don't even know what that means.
*  I can say those words, quantum entangled photons, but you may be like right down and without any Googling in an essay what a quantum entangled photon exactly is.
*  But what it looks like...
*  Are it photons from light, from sun?
*  Yeah.
*  This is the thing.
*  Quantum yin yang shows two photons being entangled in real time.
*  So it's true.
*  That's crazy.
*  A stunning experiment which reconstructs the properties of entangled protons from a 2D interface pattern could be used to design faster quantum computers.
*  And when you quantumly entangle two photons, they look like yin and yang.
*  Do you know how insane this is?
*  What does quantumly entangled mean?
*  That's a very good question that I can say and it makes me sound smarter.
*  Quantumly entangled.
*  But I couldn't write that down without Googling it exactly.
*  The quantum entanglement, is it a mixture of these photons together?
*  Well, I think what it is, is these particles are entangled in some way where they don't have to be in the same place and time, but they react to each other.
*  There's some method or some way of understanding how this is done.
*  It's all squirrely, yellow legal pad, chalkboard with a bunch of squiggles that you don't understand.
*  Bananas talk.
*  Who the fuck are these people?
*  Quantum entangled photons.
*  I don't know exactly how they do it.
*  It's a weird connection between two far apart particles that Albert Einstein objected to as spooky action at a distance.
*  Enables two light particles or photons to become inextricably bound to each other so that a change to one causes a change in the other no matter how far apart they are.
*  To make accurate predictions about a quantum object, physicists need to find its wave function, a description of its state existing in a superposition of all the possible physical values a photon can take.
*  Entanglement makes finding the wave function of two connected particles a challenge, as any measurement of one also causes an instantaneous change in the other.
*  But why are they depicted in different shades and different colors?
*  First of all, I don't trust these super dorks at all.
*  Look at the photos of those people.
*  Yeah, I don't know, man.
*  They're pretty young.
*  Yeah, they're all too smart.
*  I don't trust them.
*  They're speaking gibberish.
*  I need to see some old guys.
*  Look at this.
*  Scientists have used a first of its kind technique to visualize two entangled light particles in real time, making them appear as a stunning quantum yin-yang symbol.
*  The new method called bifoton digital holography uses an ultra high precision camera and can be used to massively speed up future quantum measurements.
*  Well, then it's all bullshit.
*  It's not real time.
*  It's not real.
*  It's a fucking it's like those super.
*  It's like the AI shit.
*  That's not a real image.
*  They colored it and fixed it and put fade and brightness and fucking you know, like, how does that?
*  I don't know if they did.
*  You don't think so?
*  No.
*  I think whatever the light is on the right, there's like a different technique of measuring it.
*  Like, what was the one on the right?
*  They do that.
*  Heat?
*  This is so this has a reconstruction of a holographic image.
*  I'm a total moron.
*  No, I think I think there's just two different ways of imaging it.
*  So I don't think there's anything fake about it.
*  I think it's just a bizarre shape that exists in ancient cultures.
*  And now they're finding out is actually two entangled photons.
*  Yeah, but who came up with all this motherfucking shit holography?
*  What the fuck is that?
*  Where did this come from now?
*  Scientists, scientists, dudes and gals and non-binary folk.
*  What is the actual definition of yin-yang, Jamie?
*  Like, what does it exactly mean?
*  It's I know it's to be balanced.
*  Like, and I knew like backgrounds in high school, all the cool kids got yin-yang tattoos.
*  I want one now.
*  Now I want one.
*  Now I'm thinking about getting one because of the quantum thing.
*  But it's so it's such a it became a corny thing.
*  Like a yin-yang became corny.
*  When I was young, it was like tribal.
*  Now I want tribal or barbed wire around the bicep.
*  Yeah, like old days.
*  Like Pam Anderson.
*  Like family Anderson.
*  A lot of wrestlers had it.
*  OK, so what does this mean?
*  Buff bagwell.
*  There's no meanings are popping up.
*  There's not.
*  I don't know about specific definition because you got to define the yin-yang.
*  Well, just Google that right there.
*  People also ask.
*  Go back.
*  And then what is the meaning of yin-yang?
*  Click on that.
*  What does that say?
*  I know it popped up.
*  Oh, it's a video.
*  Boring.
*  Like, can't it just tell you?
*  Can you just tell me, bitch?
*  Write it down.
*  So what does it mean?
*  I mean, it's of you have to describe both and then you have to describe them both together.
*  It's like describing what is light and what is dark.
*  It's a philosophy.
*  This is an open-ended philosophy.
*  This is one of the things that freaks me out about the current state of the world is that we are at odds with China.
*  And China has been around forever.
*  They are so much more established.
*  They've been around for 4,000 years, man.
*  So many dynasties.
*  They've been thriving economically for 4,000 years.
*  They invented everything.
*  China invented paper.
*  They invented alcohol.
*  They invented the mechanical clock.
*  They invented gunpowder.
*  They invented rockets.
*  I mean, bro, when I fucking order my clothes to sell, I get it from there.
*  They do it much fucking better and cheaper than here.
*  You can buy good American stuff.
*  Nah, but it's not the same.
*  Well, when you outsource, hey, listen, I like America.
*  But if you want to get it done right, you go to China.
*  That's so ridiculous.
*  That is a crazy thing to say.
*  But it is fucked up that somewhere we lost our way and we decided that it would be better for some people over here to get things paid for in a cheap manner,
*  get cheap labor from a country where they let people work for almost nothing and buy your shit from them and then sell it over here.
*  But it's just short math because everybody's like, hey, hey, hey, do you know what the fuck the trickle down of that is?
*  How about we just make less money or we don't look at it in terms of like you're never going to end.
*  It's never going to stop growing.
*  How would you like maintain what we've got and make high quality stuff and keep all these jobs here?
*  Like, what's the economic downside of getting rid of thousands of jobs every time they close a plan?
*  Thousands of jobs just to make a little bit more money or even if it's a lot more money.
*  Like, aren't you making money?
*  Isn't it so successful that you can buy a new plant in Mexico?
*  Like, what the fuck are we doing?
*  People are fucking so sure excited.
*  So it's all money, money, money, money, money, money.
*  You ever see Roger and me?
*  It's Michael Moore's best documentary, I think.
*  And it's the first one to like Michael Moore a lot.
*  He was young.
*  He's a good dude.
*  I met him a couple of times.
*  I met him one time coming out of the fucking twenty third anniversary Jordan party.
*  Fuck that's delicious.
*  Fuck that's delicious.
*  I just come on Vice and he came.
*  I walked out.
*  He was in his limo.
*  He came out.
*  He goes, action.
*  What's up?
*  I've been in the hotel room all weekend watching.
*  Fuck that's delicious.
*  I love it.
*  And this is outside the Jordan party.
*  I just met Moses Malone and shit like that.
*  It was fucking crazy.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  And this was early on.
*  He gave me that props.
*  That's nice.
*  It meant a lot to me.
*  The documentary is really good.
*  It's really good and it's really heartbreaking.
*  It's about Flint, Michigan, when the auto factories pull out.
*  He does these tearjerkers.
*  This one's a really good one.
*  Showing you the real.
*  This is the realest of the real because this is where he's from.
*  And he got to see all these people, just thousands of people, man, that were employed by the
*  auto industry just get those jobs removed and sent to Mexico.
*  And they're fucked, man.
*  No one has anything.
*  No one has anything.
*  There's just like nothing to do.
*  There's no it's not like you need to work harder.
*  It's like, no, the industry is gone.
*  There's no jobs.
*  There's nothing to do there.
*  The main thing in the town is now gone.
*  The town just died.
*  It's a ghost town now.
*  Now everyone's fucked.
*  And it happened like that.
*  And it happened because people wanted to make more money.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  So they don't make Cadillac over there anymore?
*  I don't know what they're doing now because I know a lot of things have come back to Detroit.
*  Like Detroit's kind of making a bit of a boom.
*  Sam Talent just moved to Detroit.
*  Shout out to Sam Talent.
*  Hilarious comedian if you don't know who he is.
*  But they've got you know there's a lot of like businesses that are coming out of Detroit that are like proud about it.
*  Like Shinola made in Detroit.
*  American made watches and leather bags.
*  I stay in that hotel a lot.
*  Oh, it's a good hotel man.
*  It is.
*  They're legit.
*  Shinola's legit.
*  So like there's a bunch of stuff happening there.
*  But it used to be one of the richest cities in the world.
*  Detroit in the 19th.
*  You ever seen like videos of Detroit?
*  It was fucking that's where the players came from.
*  It was Detroit players.
*  Bro.
*  That's where dressing like a player came from.
*  Bro.
*  Gators.
*  All kinds of fucking outfits and gators.
*  That's where it came from.
*  Booming economy.
*  Buffs.
*  The fucking the Cartier lenses.
*  It's like a whole thing.
*  Motor City hit man Thomas Hearns.
*  Come on man.
*  You don't think he wore Cartier lenses?
*  100%.
*  And he wore gators.
*  100%.
*  So that place was this thriving city.
*  And then all of a sudden the auto manufacturers pulled out.
*  It just was you just watched one of the great cities melt.
*  Why?
*  Because someone wanted to make more money.
*  That is so crazy that people were willing to do that.
*  It's so fucking crazy.
*  Well now I have to fucking rethink all my business models.
*  Yeah.
*  I work with Origin.
*  Origin is a company in Maine.
*  It's all American made.
*  Everything.
*  Threads.
*  Everything.
*  Cloth.
*  Everything.
*  All our hunting gears made by Origin.
*  All of it's made.
*  They develop the pattern.
*  They make it all.
*  It's all everybody gets paid well.
*  Great jobs.
*  It's just like it just feels better.
*  I always said that about like iPhones.
*  Like make me an iPhone that you make in America.
*  Just charge me more money.
*  Can you just put a little US flag in the corner so I know I'm getting that one and just charge me more money.
*  Just charge me more money.
*  Just charge me more money.
*  It's like when you buy a pair of New Balance sneakers, the made in America ones are always the better quality stuff.
*  You know you're getting quality when it says made in the US of A.
*  Oh well also you know you're getting it from people that you have to adhere to laws like labor laws.
*  You don't have to adhere to those if you're buying them from third world countries.
*  Of course.
*  So it's kind of weird that that's okay.
*  And I know I understand the economics of it.
*  I don't really but I understand that I don't understand it.
*  I understand I'm not it's not my place but I get why everybody did it.
*  But you got to look at what's what that what the cost of that is.
*  It's so insane.
*  You know someone was explaining to me that there's some African countries that get free clothes from the United States.
*  So like they'll donate like free clothes like a bunch of companies and they get together and do it free clothes which seems great.
*  Right.
*  But a lot of these developing countries have people making clothes and then all of a sudden a bunch of free clothes get dropped off and they're like hey what the fuck.
*  Like we're we're now I'm not going to sell any fucking clothes.
*  Now you literally can't get by making clothes because they're giving away free clothes and giving away free free free clothes is like a point of no return.
*  Free clothes is like a part of their whole charitable organization like to make everybody feel great.
*  Yeah but they don't need to be doing that.
*  But you could in fact create a growing economy by giving people free clothes.
*  Give them food.
*  I would never thought that I would have never thought that given someone free clothes could ever be bad.
*  But it could be bad if they're actually starting to develop an economy or they have a thriving economy and somebody makes clothes there.
*  And all of a sudden you know we think we should give them free clothes that's going to fix everything and make us feel better.
*  I'll tell you this in every fucking third world country I've been to they got fucking Lionel Messi jerseys.
*  They got Vinny Jr. jerseys.
*  They got all they got all kinds of sports jerseys.
*  They're not wearing any they're wearing fucking jerseys and all kinds of sports clothing.
*  Puma.
*  Interesting. That's that's the cool shit.
*  Always always young kids always got the fucking soccer jerseys on or just like a team shirt.
*  I see Yankee shirts.
*  That's always been the case.
*  Always.
*  Come on.
*  I mean I to this day my wardrobe is jerseys.
*  That's all I like wearing.
*  I like wearing Patrick Ewing.
*  Yeah Patrick you I wore this jersey in like 30 countries around.
*  I never take it off.
*  It's like I'm fucking Pat.
*  I should put the knee braces on.
*  It makes you feel casual.
*  Really does it makes me feel casual and also makes me feel like you know where the fuck I'm from.
*  Yeah I'm wearing it on my chest bro.
*  Exactly right.
*  Nobody's going to mistake you for a Georgia boy.
*  Oh no.
*  Hey my any one come alligator.
*  You're not going to fucking think that.
*  No.
*  That's for sure.
*  No not at all.
*  I was listening to that.
*  I wanted to bring this up because I think that this is fucked up.
*  I'm listening to WFAN radio in New York City and they run these weird commercials for older men and shit like that and stuff.
*  There was this one fucking Dr. Darius Paduk fucking a crime against men a urologist who fucking touched hundreds and hundreds of men apparently.
*  They're running this spot on the radio station.
*  Saturday morning I'm watching SpongeBob on Nickelodeon with my child.
*  They run the fucking same spot but a visual of Darius fucking Paduk.
*  Why are they running that spot on Nickelodeon?
*  For parents.
*  They're assuming the parents are watching the show with the kids.
*  But my son is asking me who the fuck is Darius Paduk and I don't know how to explain that.
*  That he's done urology and crime against men.
*  He did crime against men.
*  I don't know how to explain that.
*  So what do you mean by he did crime against men?
*  They were crimes against men.
*  He touched.
*  He did weird things to them during urology exams.
*  And this ad that they were running was an ad like a news story, breaking news story?
*  Not a breaking news but like one of those if you have the fucking the mesh in your stomach recall you could get money or this.
*  Like they want people to come forward.
*  All the victims of Dr. Darius Paduk.
*  Oh I see.
*  So I just found that a little bit fucking.
*  Maybe it's for parents.
*  Yeah but why aren't Nickelodeon SpongeBob Saturday morning when they're running the same spot on WFAN for like 60 year old men?
*  That's a good question.
*  I just thought that was fucked.
*  Maybe it's just a mistake.
*  That's my one contribution to this.
*  It was a good one though.
*  Yeah imagine if commercials were illegal.
*  Bro.
*  Imagine if we decided that everything has to exist on its own merit.
*  And you know word of mouth is the only thing that counts.
*  There's plenty of social media out.
*  No one's allowed to advertise at all anymore ever again.
*  Bye.
*  I would love that.
*  No more spots.
*  No more this.
*  No more fucking reads.
*  No more.
*  Listen.
*  All these reads bro it's a lot.
*  It's a fucking lot.
*  I'm not used to it.
*  I'm not used to it.
*  I don't love it.
*  Yeah.
*  AI is going to take that for you.
*  Should I do it now?
*  You think I could pull that one off now?
*  Probably pretty fucking close.
*  Pretty fucking close.
*  What is this AI with the iPhone that I'm seeing on Instagram?
*  This is the newest AI that Apple.
*  Should I throw this against the wall?
*  I don't know.
*  Elon seems to be very apprehensive.
*  And he said something about that if it is in the operating system.
*  If it's in iOS itself.
*  He doesn't think they're going to be able to control it.
*  And he thinks it represents a security risk to the extent that he's not going to allow people to,
*  if this does get implemented as a part of the operating system,
*  he's not going to allow people at Tesla to have them.
*  He's not going to allow them to come in with like iPads or laptops that are Apple.
*  And it got to go in some sort of box.
*  Listen man, if he's getting scared, I get scared.
*  I'm scared.
*  I get scared.
*  When he's saying, hey, you're letting that fucking thing in everyone's phones
*  and you don't know how to control it.
*  And they're like, hey, we got AI.
*  You know why they got AI?
*  Do you know why they're doing that?
*  Because of this.
*  This is the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.
*  You're no fool. I'm about to get it.
*  This is my new phone.
*  I'm getting it.
*  Yeah. Listen, Apple's great.
*  I love Apple. I'm not a hater.
*  I'm going to keep this phone too.
*  But there's things that I could do with this phone that I can't do with this phone.
*  This phone has anti-glare screens.
*  It's way better to look at outside.
*  It's way better. Instantly I noticed that.
*  It charges quicker.
*  It has all kinds of crazy shit.
*  Like you can circle an object and Google just searches it for you.
*  It tells you, like you see someone's sneakers, you're like, damn, those are cool.
*  Google sends you a link.
*  It shows where you can shop for it.
*  It does a lot of shit that you can't get on an iPhone right now.
*  So they didn't respond to that.
*  They don't even look that cool.
*  They're cool, but they're like, they're antiquated.
*  This thing translates in real time.
*  So you could be speaking Italian and I could be speaking English.
*  We could have a conversation.
*  That's one of the best things to use.
*  My wife and I, we have this masseuse.
*  She's a Chinese woman about 70 years old.
*  We're great friends with her.
*  And we just talk with the phone.
*  Translate, translate.
*  It's phenomenal.
*  She sends text messages, full Chinese characters.
*  Wow.
*  Translate.
*  That's dope.
*  Isn't that dope?
*  I would love to just be able to like say something and then in my voice it says it in Chinese to her.
*  I think they're doing that.
*  I think they're doing that.
*  I think that is 100% going to happen.
*  I'd learn Chinese that way also.
*  Yes, you really could.
*  It's better than Rosetta Stone.
*  What's the best way?
*  There's a bunch of different like controversial best way to learn.
*  You could learn Spanish in six weeks.
*  I'll tell you how to fucking learn Spanish.
*  Go work in the kitchen.
*  Right.
*  With some Mexican dudes that will not speak English to you.
*  That's how you learn.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to pick it up.
*  That's how I learned.
*  Pick it up eventually.
*  That is what they say immersion, right?
*  That's the best way to really learn a language.
*  I mean also like if you learn like phrases, like phrases as far as like I don't know.
*  I don't even know how to, I can't even give you an example.
*  Like things about the day or what you're about to do or shit like that.
*  Just normal phrases that you would use in everyday life.
*  If you just use those, more than likely they're going to catch one way or another.
*  You can use them in different settings.
*  You just got to know a couple of things.
*  And then you build off that.
*  Imagine how funny that must sound to them.
*  Our stupid Spanish.
*  You know?
*  It's like Borat sounds to us.
*  Yeah, no I mean the one thing that I do, I love when immigrants come here and they try to speak English.
*  Because a lot of Americans they don't fucking try and speak any other languages.
*  Right.
*  But everybody comes here and learns English one way or another.
*  They're speaking broken but you understand it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's probably the most, other than Spanish, the most recognized language.
*  Like what is the most popular language on earth?
*  Well, numbers wise it might be Mandarin.
*  Or it might be Hindi.
*  Like what is the most popular language on earth?
*  Like take a guess. What do you think it is?
*  I think it's Spanish.
*  I think it's the most spoken language in the world.
*  The most spoken one.
*  Spanish is?
*  I'm asking like what the correct.
*  Yeah, let's see.
*  What are the most spoken languages in the world?
*  What are the most spoken languages in the world?
*  It says Chinese but.
*  Chinese number one?
*  Yeah.
*  That makes sense.
*  I thought there was multiple dialects.
*  Right.
*  But like maybe it's just.
*  It's just Chinese slash Mandarin.
*  Okay.
*  900 million.
*  900 million bro.
*  Yeah but there's a lot of fucking guys over there speaking their language natively.
*  I don't know if it, you know, I've never met a white guy that can speak it perfectly or a black guy that can speak it perfectly.
*  I've met a few people that know Mandarin.
*  A couple.
*  Yeah.
*  A couple.
*  Very strange.
*  But who knows Cantonese?
*  John Cena.
*  Fuck out of here.
*  Fucking John Cena doesn't know Cantonese.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  He knows Mandarin.
*  What?
*  This says English is number one.
*  One of them says English is number one.
*  It depends on what you're talking about.
*  But that only says 1.552 million.
*  Oh wow.
*  1 billion 452.
*  That was the best answer I've ever heard in my life.
*  A lot of Chinese people might know English because of the internet.
*  Oh.
*  You know we don't.
*  I don't know.
*  You know main language versus you know a couple words.
*  Can you hold a conversation?
*  Interesting.
*  English has become the world's most common language.
*  Default for international business, tourism, tech and much more.
*  I mean that programming things is a big thing.
*  So if you can't program in multiple languages.
*  Isn't there some shit going down right now with Saudi Arabia is getting off the US dollar, the petrodollar?
*  That's different.
*  I know it's a little different but I was just thinking about like things I'm scared of.
*  More things I'm scared of.
*  I mean listen.
*  There's so many things out there that we have no clue that we should be scared of.
*  As long as I don't know I'm alright.
*  That's a way to live.
*  Right for right now.
*  But if you tell me then I'll be like fuck.
*  Right now you know.
*  Now you gotta operate.
*  Now I gotta figure it out.
*  Knowing that aliens are real.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  If you think about what this actually is.
*  What are we fucking doing this life experience?
*  Aliens this that.
*  There's all kinds of crazy shit.
*  We can't just think that.
*  Are we even living right now?
*  What is happening right now?
*  What is this?
*  It might be simulation theory.
*  Exactly.
*  You get something Jamie?
*  Something that says what you said but I don't know.
*  So they dished the US dollar today right?
*  It was a pact for 50 years.
*  I don't know that it wasn't expected.
*  The dollar is a piece of shit.
*  Is it?
*  I think so.
*  I like them.
*  I love them.
*  I like the way I have a bunch of them sitting right there that I could hold but I don't.
*  They're almost worthless.
*  Craig Jones came in here and he had a million dollars in cash.
*  On him?
*  And I wanted to run away with it.
*  I wanted to grab that bag and run.
*  You see a million dollars in cash.
*  It's just piles of hundreds like this is crazy.
*  A million dollars in cash isn't that much though.
*  It's a bag.
*  Yeah it's a bag.
*  In hundreds it's like a gym bag stuffed with hundreds.
*  It was weird.
*  That looks good.
*  It looked good.
*  That looks good to me.
*  It looked good.
*  It looks like a drug deal gone bad.
*  Yeah or good.
*  Both.
*  Yeah.
*  Life in the fast lane.
*  Show them they can lose your mind.
*  It's only 22 pounds of money.
*  Oh.
*  22 pounds of money.
*  It's like the things you were doing with the rod.
*  With the fucking gloves.
*  With the rod.
*  Yeah you could do that with that bag of money.
*  Just do kettlebells with that bag of money.
*  I mean that would be fire to work out.
*  Yeah you could do some shield cast with that bag of money.
*  Listen all I know is that a million dollars isn't even a lot anymore.
*  It's not even a lot.
*  And you need to do a lot to make a million dollars.
*  Especially when you make one million dollars you're not making one million dollars.
*  Right.
*  In California that's about to become the average home price.
*  I mean eight years ago I was in Vancouver and they told me that was the average price.
*  A million.
*  A million dollars.
*  And what does the average person make?
*  I think they make 62 thousand dollars.
*  Who the fuck is living in these places?
*  It's insane.
*  The average home being a million dollars.
*  Like everyone's in debt.
*  And then you've got companies that are buying up houses just so they can lease them out to people and make money leasing them.
*  I mean bro look at New York City.
*  I'm over here looking for a house.
*  I'm competing with brokers and like big people who want to put buildings where these old homes used to be.
*  Right.
*  They're ready to just go you know.
*  They do a lot of that stuff out here like on 6th Street.
*  They're going to start to do that.
*  But a lot of these places we see giant ass skyscrapers.
*  They used to be like a little bitch ass building.
*  And somebody bought it up and just built straight up.
*  And they're trying to do that a lot.
*  That's what happens.
*  That's fucking capitalism.
*  Is that called industrial revolution?
*  No.
*  Capitalism.
*  You know it's good if you want to live in an apartment building.
*  But you just got to recognize what it is and what's going on.
*  You know apartment buildings are good for certain things.
*  It's fun.
*  That's all I've known my whole life.
*  Two bedroom.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all I've known.
*  I'd like to know something about custom to that.
*  I only stay in like if there's a table here in the room I just sit in this one corner only.
*  I wouldn't even go on that side of the fucking table.
*  Because you used to be confined?
*  I'm a creature.
*  I'm a creature.
*  Just leave me in the corner as a creature.
*  That's it.
*  I don't need space.
*  I'm like a little baby veal.
*  Just like to huddle up in your den.
*  I do with my fucking pipe.
*  Huffing.
*  Watching MMA talk.
*  Constant over like chel sonning talking crazy.
*  How do you think you would live if you lived in a place with a lot of land and quiet nights?
*  Do you think you'd be missing it?
*  I would have to have some sort of live entertainment.
*  I love live entertainment.
*  Something near you you can go see?
*  Yeah.
*  Either that or just like something exciting at the house.
*  Like a band.
*  I would bring sick musicians to the home.
*  You know?
*  All these different jazz and funk fusion bands and these old school bands that I love I would bring them all.
*  Have little mini concerts back there.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's kind of what Dave Chappelle does in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Yeah. He's always got like musicians out there.
*  Comedians out there.
*  He's living the way he needs to live. That's what he wants.
*  He started doing that during the pandemic when everybody was locked down.
*  He was doing outside shows with masks on.
*  Remember those days?
*  Oh yeah. He was doing fucking hooky parties.
*  He was doing the old school hooky party.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are so crazy days.
*  You couldn't go outside without a mask on.
*  I was wearing a gas mask to go to the fucking supermarket.
*  Can you believe that?
*  I had a fucking 3M gas mask with the two things here.
*  I looked at myself in the mirror and I said, what am I doing?
*  And I just took that shit off.
*  I'm like, yo, everyone's going to have to deal with me.
*  If you're outside and I'm outside it's on you.
*  Well in LA people would yell at you.
*  They would yell at you if you'd be outside with no mask on.
*  There was nobody out in the streets of New York.
*  I had the whole city to myself.
*  There was a lot of days like that.
*  I had the whole city to myself.
*  I would get from one place to another in lightning speed.
*  Do you remember there was this one kid who crashed a million dollar Porsche?
*  He crashed some crazy, I think it was one of those Carrera GTs.
*  That Paul Walker one?
*  Yeah. It was either that or the 918.
*  Some crazy car.
*  And this dude was just using New York City like a racetrack because there was no cars.
*  I didn't know about that.
*  I was doing the same thing in a Jeep Grand Cherokee though.
*  That's the problem.
*  This guy fucked up that car.
*  That's a nice one.
*  That's a Carrera GT.
*  There's not that many of them in the world.
*  And this is a Gambala.
*  That looks total.
*  It has charges dismissed.
*  Oh, the charges are dismissed?
*  This guy was just driving around like a fucking psychopath.
*  Oof.
*  When there was no one on the streets.
*  He's lucky he's alive in that one.
*  He wiped that fucking car up.
*  That's some fucking gorgeous vehicle.
*  I wonder if they totaled the car.
*  It looks like it's totaled.
*  I'd buy that at the auction.
*  Somebody would.
*  If you have a Carrera GT like that, there's other people that have Carrera GTs that would want things from it.
*  Of course.
*  Even if it is totaled, there's a lot of that stuff.
*  I'd just love to selfish those parts.
*  If Porsche lets that happen, I don't know how they...
*  That's such an exclusive car.
*  Some of those companies like Ferrari and Porsche,
*  they have rules on how you're allowed to sell things.
*  Like even if you crash it, they'll just take it back?
*  I don't know.
*  I bet they would.
*  I bet some of them would.
*  You can't get under that thing to get the catalytic converter.
*  No.
*  There's no way.
*  That is the same car that Paul Walker died in.
*  That is.
*  I'm a motherfucker, man.
*  If you hit one bump in the city and you're going at a specific speed,
*  you're hydro-gliding.
*  You're in the air spinning.
*  Well, what does this say?
*  The reason for dismissal was apparently a lack of proof.
*  Rodentrack cites a record from the court appearance
*  as stating the people are moving to dismiss this matter
*  because the case cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  because the case cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  Where did this happen?
*  On the bridge or in the city or somewhere?
*  I think it was in the city.
*  Okay, so look up at the top, go to the top, top.
*  It says,
*  A very publicized incident occurred nearly a year ago
*  in the then empty streets of New York City.
*  A rare Gumballa Mirage GT
*  was captured on video
*  crashing into several vehicles
*  before finally coming to a stop.
*  Video even captured the driver behind the wheel
*  who was later identified as Benjamin Chen.
*  Now, charges against Chen
*  for the incidents have apparently been dismissed.
*  So they're saying to dismiss it
*  because the case cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
*  Huh.
*  Huh. Okay.
*  Did any of those jurors buy new cars?
*  Like, look at him wiping it out.
*  Oh my god. Let me see that again.
*  Let me see that again.
*  Oh yeah, he was full on out of control.
*  He's lucky he hit the passenger side.
*  He's lucky he hit the passenger side.
*  Yeah, he fucked that car up.
*  He's trying to get away.
*  So I guess, you know,
*  people were encouraged
*  by the fact that there was no one in the streets
*  to let it out a little bit.
*  I was.
*  Jamie, that's not proof. That's CGI.
*  That him getting out of the car
*  also not proof.
*  Shut up, you fucking communist.
*  The cops are talking to him.
*  I don't understand.
*  The city was a motherfucking playground.
*  It'll never be like that again.
*  Stop being a communist, Jamie.
*  Fucking narc. Look at him over there.
*  Narc'ing on that kid.
*  He's wearing a wire? Yeah, he's wearing a wire.
*  This room's all mic'd up.
*  God damn it.
*  Now you tell me.
*  How did we get under that?
*  People driving crazy down New York City?
*  He had the city to himself.
*  Yeah, I just had the city to myself during the pandemic.
*  There was no one around.
*  There was literally nobody.
*  Nothing to be said.
*  Bro, LA had no traffic.
*  You could drive around in LA and there was no one on the road.
*  It was the weirdest fucking thing ever.
*  Ian Edwards has a joke about it.
*  I want to find out how much time it really takes to get places.
*  You see?
*  You never know.
*  I've been in the worst traffic over there.
*  It gives me PTSD.
*  I don't even want to drive anymore.
*  I get very bad road rage these days.
*  It's bad for your head, man.
*  I'm in the car windows up screaming.
*  You just can't go anywhere.
*  I'm freaking out. I can't get myself together.
*  What if you're low on gas?
*  Or what if you're low on batteries?
*  Or if you've got to take a shit.
*  Or if you've got things to do.
*  If you're caught up out there, I'll do crazy things to get out of traffic.
*  There's nothing I wouldn't do.
*  I'll ride on the side. I'll go through the forest.
*  Whatever I need to do to get out of traffic, I've done.
*  You know one of the things that's interesting is that Waze,
*  which is really the best way to get around,
*  if you want to find out where the bullshit is,
*  Waze is really good.
*  People report there's an accident here.
*  Everybody communicates.
*  Very, very good.
*  But Waze was making people
*  that were leaving New York
*  and driving through Jersey,
*  they were just going through all these neighborhoods.
*  They say the highway is going to be jammed up.
*  But you can get around the highway by going this way.
*  So Waze starts navigating people
*  through neighborhoods.
*  Then the cops stop people from going
*  through the neighborhoods.
*  They can't drive through here.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  No, you have a problem.
*  The problem is Waze told me
*  how to get through your neighborhood.
*  You've got to take it up with Waze.
*  You can't tell me I can't drive on a regular street.
*  I can drive on a regular street just to look around.
*  Totally illegal.
*  Trying to check out the scenery.
*  This is a nice house. I want to drive by.
*  What are you saying?
*  I used to go on nature rides with my mother all the time.
*  But when you're saying that
*  Waze shouldn't have told people
*  about this cool shortcut through your neighborhood
*  so you didn't have to be on the highway,
*  you're right.
*  But that's just reality.
*  Reality is it always existed.
*  Waze just exposed it to the rest of the world
*  that take a left on Peabody
*  and then you're on a nice
*  four lane road with no one on it.
*  It's like exposing the best pizza shop.
*  It's the same shit guy.
*  Pardon me.
*  Fucking asshole, now there's a line around the block.
*  I can't get a pie you piece of shit.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Things change.
*  Everyone needs to know about it, how good it is.
*  But for me, New York,
*  I rarely drive with Waze or any type of Google.
*  I just know how to go.
*  I know the shortcuts
*  of everywhere I need to go.
*  Yeah?
*  If you see something's congested there,
*  you go back around.
*  What if it's something you don't know?
*  Like something's going on.
*  Then I'm fucked.
*  Then I'm fucked.
*  If I'm anticipated,
*  I know the Van Wicks always fucked.
*  So I'll take a lip, I'll go all through
*  South Ozone Park, boom, boom.
*  I'll get there before everybody.
*  You just get used to hustling.
*  Moving quick through intersections.
*  Trying to change lanes.
*  I cannot drive straight.
*  I could drive all day long doing that.
*  Stopping at lights,
*  finding ways to get out of things all day.
*  Straight, 45 minutes,
*  I'm fucking knocked out.
*  Bad.
*  Do you fall asleep at the wheel?
*  No, but I will.
*  I know that, that's why I don't do it.
*  You get that naughty, sleepy...
*  It's because I'm bored.
*  I need movement.
*  You're addicted to New York.
*  I really am.
*  It's fucking sick.
*  You're addicted like a video game.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a fucking video game over there, man.
*  It's constant maneuvering and moving.
*  I just feel alive.
*  Constant people.
*  I feel alive.
*  I have a bunch of friends who won't leave.
*  I'd like to.
*  I love the vibration of the city, all the people.
*  I do, but I also hate it.
*  I have a love-hate relationship with lots of things,
*  as we all do.
*  You can't just love Austin, there's nothing that you don't like about it.
*  I'm sure there's some shit you don't like.
*  Right now, growing up in the city,
*  there's just nothing like it, man.
*  There's nothing like New York City.
*  I've been all over the fucking place,
*  and I can't wait to get home.
*  I cannot wait.
*  As soon as I touch down JFK,
*  I start clapping like Dominican Republic planes just landed in DR.
*  I'm like, yeah, motherfucker, I'm home.
*  Nice.
*  Well, it looks like you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I'm like, yeah, motherfucker, I'm home.
*  Nice.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You belong there.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah, I'm a city boy.
*  That suits your personality.
*  It's fun.
*  As someone who enjoys music and food,
*  what a great place.
*  How do you go wrong there?
*  You have both things there, in abundance.
*  Nonstop. It's never-ending.
*  It's also very tiring.
*  You saw today how we got demolished
*  with that Egyptian barbecue.
*  Imagine that was just me there
*  sitting and being expected to eat all that
*  as usual.
*  While he was stacking on the tray, I'm like,
*  surely there's other people eating with us.
*  I was hoping some of the guys would have something.
*  Yeah, and then the sides, there were so many sides.
*  I was like, damn, you're not eating any of that stuff
*  because you don't eat carb.
*  I'm like, bro, don't even put the carbs there, just meat.
*  Just carne.
*  So much good food.
*  Very interesting, though. I love when people do something like that.
*  Like a dude is just chilling in Egypt.
*  And he says, you know what?
*  I'm going to move to Austin, Texas
*  and just make barbecue.
*  That's what I want to do with my life.
*  People get enchanted, man.
*  They do. They get enchanted.
*  I love when people go for shit.
*  I love when someone gets enchanted and says,
*  fuck it, let's do it.
*  Let's just jump on. Let's see what happens.
*  That's how magic happens.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  That's how fun life experiences happen.
*  Sometimes you've got to take a chance.
*  Yeah, you've got to do something different.
*  Just take a chance.
*  Maybe I've got to leave New York.
*  Florida.
*  What do you think about Florida?
*  No, a remote Amazon tribe
*  did not get addiction to porn.
*  Oh, man. Porn addiction is real.
*  Can I tell you what I use porn for?
*  They are definitely watching porn.
*  And the guy was complaining about porn.
*  Let me tell you what I use porn for.
*  When I'm in the studio alone doing push-ups.
*  We have to clarify this.
*  I have to find out what...
*  We'll get to your studio and do push-ups.
*  But this is something that we actually talked about.
*  So I want to find out what we were wrong about.
*  A guy wrote a story about his trip there.
*  And someone took a quote.
*  He said...
*  He got from one of the people there that said that
*  some of the boys were sharing pornography
*  and WhatsApp.
*  And then that took off to say that they're all addicted to porn.
*  And got republished on tons of websites.
*  And apparently that was not accurate.
*  Interesting.
*  But they do have access to the internet.
*  And they are scrolling in their phones constantly.
*  And they are boys.
*  People are not addicted to pornography.
*  There is no hint of this in the forest.
*  There is no suggestion of it in the New York Times article.
*  Right.
*  Here's the thing though. What does that mean?
*  They don't see anyone fucking whacking off in the forest?
*  What does that mean?
*  When you say addicted to pornography.
*  First of all, if you're exposed to pornography
*  and you use pornography.
*  Like at what point in time does someone get to decide
*  that you're addicted?
*  So let's just take out that word.
*  Let's take out the word addicted.
*  Because addicted is a weird word.
*  Let's just say, do they use pornography?
*  Are they using pornography? Is pornography now part of their culture?
*  I would have to say
*  100%.
*  If you have an internet connection and you're a young boy
*  and you find out there's videos out there of people fucking.
*  You're going to look at them.
*  Ex videos.
*  Every kid is going to look at them.
*  If you have a phone that gets online, they're going to look at them.
*  So to say that they're not addicted to pornography.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  By my definition, sure.
*  But also, they're using pornography for the first time ever.
*  They used to live in the jungle with no internet
*  and all of a sudden now they have porn.
*  And to pretend that that might not have some sort of an impact on them
*  that's not positive.
*  That seems a little crazy.
*  What do they fucking think is going to happen?
*  Maybe defining it as addicted to porn
*  is the problem.
*  Instead of saying that, maybe they should have said
*  kids are looking at porn
*  for the first time ever.
*  Which is really just as stunning.
*  It's sensational.
*  It's a sensational headline.
*  This is what it was driven out of.
*  The article mentioned a complaint from
*  one Marubo leader
*  that some Marubo minors
*  had shared pornography in WhatsApp group chats.
*  This is especially concerning, he said,
*  because Marubo culture friends are not
*  as much of a part of the community as they are of the community.
*  This is concerning, he said, because Marubo culture
*  frowns upon even kissing in public.
*  Well, I would imagine that
*  that would fuck with his head.
*  If they have a culture that has like rigid
*  social values, and then all of a sudden
*  this thing online
*  is allowing kids to see people
*  fuck when before
*  they couldn't even see people kiss in public.
*  And all of a sudden something is coming along
*  and disrupting your culture.
*  I get it. But do you want the fucking
*  email or not, bitch?
*  How are you going to get your email?
*  Come on, bro. Don't you want YouTube?
*  Do you or do you not
*  want YouTube? I want everything.
*  Right. So you're going to have to get
*  tell your kids that people fuck.
*  And that there's videos about it
*  and all kinds of fucking Amazonian shit.
*  Imagine it. How hard ass
*  is their culture? You can't even kiss in public.
*  I can't even hug
*  or touch or fucking look at each other.
*  The first porn video that we all had
*  around eight years old was called Brazilian Butt.
*  That was just, it was like a hard
*  plastic case. And my boy
*  Phila Nunziato had it at his house.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Imagine being a person
*  that experiences that though.
*  Imagine being a person that has lived
*  in an indigenous tribe
*  in the Amazon jungle
*  forever. Your family,
*  your family's family, everybody came from
*  this area. You all know the ways of
*  living there. And then out of
*  nowhere,
*  Elon drops in with his
*  fucking Starlink. And then
*  you're looking at titties
*  on WhatsApp. You're like, what the fuck
*  is this? Like what a mind
*  changing experience that must be for
*  a young kid. Titties, you know
*  what? Titties seems more normal because
*  we're used to seeing tits. We all had
*  them in our mouths. But hardcore
*  gang bangs and fucking
*  deep penetration. Yeah.
*  That could be shocking.
*  Yeah. Like I was saying before,
*  the way I'm addicted
*  to porn, is I like to use it to work out.
*  It's like pre-workout. You watch
*  a little porn. You put some cocksucking
*  videos on and you do push ups. You're getting
*  that, that
*  feeling before like you're gonna
*  fucking do something but you're not doing anything.
*  So it gives you all the benefits.
*  Oh I see. It's like edging.
*  Right. You get a little testosterone boost. Yeah exactly.
*  Yeah, nice.
*  Well I'm just when I'm alone.
*  Not when I got the fellas over fucking
*  working out. Guys, I got a new
*  method. Everybody stroke and kill
*  it half hard.
*  Nah, but it really works. Well they're gonna have
*  AI porn in the future.
*  Pornstar's gonna be out of business. I saw
*  they just made an AI porn of that uh,
*  The Stallion.
*  Megan The Stallion. I didn't see
*  it but they did. They made a deep fake of her.
*  Yeah, they're gonna be able to do that. They had those, the Taylor
*  Swift deep fake during the Super Bowl
*  stuff. Those were interesting.
*  There's gonna be a lot of those coming.
*  The technology is
*  just gonna be too powerful.
*  I wonder how much your iPhone's gonna be
*  able to do that. Cause if Apple
*  is doing it with open AI,
*  you're gonna do some wild shit with
*  open AI now. I've heard that you could,
*  you're gonna be able to say like, make
*  a birthday cake, excuse me,
*  with Jamie,
*  you know, jumping out of it. And
*  they'll be able to do that. It's not even clear yet if
*  like, you have to pay for it to use
*  chatgpt 4.0. And then like,
*  do you still have to pay? Once it's on
*  out, like in the Apple operating system? Or do you
*  have like a dumbed version? Right, well it'll be the subscription
*  that you pay for through Apple.
*  Or you get like five uses a month. There's
*  been no clarification on that.
*  Yeah. You have to
*  pay for all of them honestly right now. None of them are
*  you can use technically like little free
*  free uses like you're just sort of dabbling
*  in it. But to do anything cool,
*  and even the coolest shit you can't, no one
*  really has access to all the cool video ones.
*  No one can fuck with that stuff.
*  How are they putting the ones up of the dudes
*  like at the NFL, I mean
*  the NBA press conference,
*  like Anthony Edwards
*  when he was facing the Mavericks
*  talking mad shit about Luka Doncic.
*  It's fake? Yeah, I mean he's talking crazy.
*  Yeah, they did have fake press conference
*  talking fucking absolute crazy. My dad
*  even sent me one he thought was real. I thought it was
*  real at first. I was like, I don't care.
*  Right, but here's the thing, like how close
*  is it to where you can't ever
*  be able to tell? That's gonna get weird.
*  The only
*  way that he was speaking, there was some
*  weirdness to the pattern.
*  But a person could be
*  fooled for sure if it wasn't like that crazy
*  talk. If it was something normal
*  that was just false,
*  100% believable.
*  I think they're real
*  close to making
*  I think you're gonna be able to change inflections
*  and have it perfect.
*  What they're doing now is
*  so much better than what they were doing
*  just a couple of years ago.
*  The deep fakes from a couple of years ago look hilarious.
*  Like Kyle Dunnigan, you ever see
*  his stuff? No. Kyle Dunnigan
*  does these deep fakes where he does like
*  Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump.
*  It looks terrible. But that's
*  part of the funny is that he's got
*  these fucking squiggly things
*  over his face. It looks like shit.
*  It's cartoonish. It's almost like watching
*  I love that. Like South Park's funnier
*  because it doesn't even look remotely realistic.
*  Like the face doesn't move but the
*  body moves. Yeah, well his
*  face swaps are hilarious.
*  Pull up one of them
*  just so you can see it.
*  It looks so fake that it comforts you.
*  It doesn't creep you out.
*  It doesn't look exactly like
*  Caitlyn Jenner.
*  I did a weird deep fake video
*  for a song called Latin Grammys
*  where I superimposed my face
*  on Magnus Ver Magnus in space.
*  And it was like the 94
*  Strongman. I was just, oh what the fuck.
*  Oh yeah, that's crazy.
*  Hey guess what?
*  Caitlyn's braggers too.
*  Yeah baby.
*  We
*  what?
*  I remember, this was a couple years ago
*  right? Yeah. I remember when this
*  came out.
*  Babies can breathe in the womb.
*  Yeah.
*  Babies can breathe in the womb.
*  That's right. Do you have a womb?
*  Oh shit.
*  I guess it's dead. I better go plop this thing out before
*  I get septic shock.
*  Oh my god, Zod.
*  Your lip gloss is
*  on fleek. It's Kylie's.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  That's amazing.
*  See it's funny because it's so
*  fake. It's ridiculous.
*  That's nice. That's a nice face swap.
*  I love shit like that. Yeah.
*  I love a good slapstick comedy
*  like Leslie Nielsen and fucking
*  Nordberg and you know what I mean?
*  They don't make things like that anymore.
*  Like the old naked gun with OJ Simpson.
*  OJ Simpson was in a comedy.
*  Oh my god. He was fucking phenomenal
*  in that movie.
*  He got killed in every kind of way that you can.
*  I don't remember it. Nordberg bro.
*  He gets
*  shot by the sheik.
*  Then his foot goes on fire. Then he hits his head
*  on something. It's like
*  non-stop comedy.
*  Leslie Nielsen was one of those dudes that just could do
*  no wrong. What a man.
*  One of my favorites. He had some funny fucking movies.
*  Was he in one
*  of those
*  Stephen King?
*  You know, what are those Stephen Kings?
*  You know you had
*  that one compilation like a comic
*  book.
*  Was it Tales from the Crypt?
*  Tales from the Hood.
*  That was a copy of that. That was like a scary
*  Tales from the Hood was crazy.
*  I think it's Tales from the Crypt, right?
*  Was Leslie Nielsen in that?
*  He was in an Alfred Hitchcock thing.
*  I remember seeing Tales from the Crypt
*  in the movie theater.
*  Dude. HBO shit. I think he was
*  in it.
*  Was he in Tales from the Crypt?
*  He was in Dracula. Like a weird
*  version of Dracula. No way. He was Dracula?
*  He was. Creep Show.
*  That's what it is. Not Tales from the Crypt.
*  Creep Show. Creep Show was a Stephen
*  King adaptation.
*  And he was in it. It was like a
*  bunch of cool stories. One of them was a guy had
*  a monster under his stairs.
*  And this
*  dude opened the stair and
*  the monster ate him. It's like
*  what? What am I watching there?
*  They were fun. I love those little
*  old school fucking, old school
*  scary movies.
*  Oh yeah. He buried Ted Danson up to
*  I think he drugged him and then buried him
*  up to his head and left him there
*  in the sand. And the tide was
*  going to come and wash him away.
*  This was a serious movie?
*  No. It was a horror movie. But
*  not funny?
*  No. No. Not funny. Kind of funny.
*  But he wasn't being a funny guy in that movie.
*  He was being an asshole. He was killing some dude.
*  And then the dude,
*  spoiler alert, comes
*  gets him.
*  He digs himself out. Ted Danson.
*  Something happened. They're not specific.
*  Ted Danson's an underrated actor
*  also.
*  Pretty good movie. I love a good stupid
*  scary movie.
*  Just kind of dumb
*  but scary. Fun.
*  Like the comedies that he did.
*  Naked Gun. Airplane. Airplane's
*  the classic. Of course. Spy Hard
*  Dracula. Dead and loving it.
*  That's a fun. But all those like Mel Brooks
*  movies. History of the World. All that shit.
*  Oh man. I grew up on that.
*  Good old Jewish comedy.
*  Slapsticky. Yeah. Slapstick
*  fuck. My grandfather loved all that shit.
*  Jackie Gleason and the Catskills.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's um, it's interesting
*  when you watch comedy movies now are
*  scarce. There's just not a whole lot of them.
*  They're not that funny. There's nobody
*  that's doing a comedy movie that makes me laugh.
*  Well, in order to
*  make a really good comedy movie, you're going to have
*  to be insensitive. For sure.
*  For sure. And people are just not
*  willing to do that right now.
*  And so it's a
*  sign of a sickness of our culture I think.
*  I really do. It's a sign
*  of our adaptation in
*  a wrong way. In a negative way to
*  social media. We're like
*  inhibiting people from creating
*  things that we all loved.
*  It's that bullshit. Yeah.
*  It's fucking, it's a bullshit world
*  where everyone feels like
*  they're so sensitive they can't be made
*  fun of. Growing up in my
*  neighborhood you needed thick skin.
*  You know, everyone got made fun of whether you were a
*  hot dude, hot girl, fucking
*  jacked, skinny, fat, this,
*  whatever. Everyone called it.
*  It's also how people
*  find out if you take yourself too seriously.
*  Of course. This is
*  the best way to find out if someone
*  takes themselves seriously is to
*  make jokes about them. In front
*  of them. In front of them. Fuck with them.
*  And see if they laugh.
*  And if they laugh, then you're going to have a good time.
*  But if they get super uptight, are you going to be
*  super sensitive about everything?
*  Come on, man. Like when you even have to
*  tell somebody that you already know you should just fucking
*  not hang out with that person. Just get the fuck out of here, man.
*  I can't do you. It's enough.
*  Maybe you'll talk in a few years, see if you've evolved.
*  Tell them to fucking take some
*  drugs. Yeah.
*  Open it up. Would you recommend?
*  Something like that.
*  The
*  thing that people seem the most open
*  to is hitting the DMT pen.
*  Yeah. You know?
*  Because it seems like they're vaping. Exactly.
*  The pen makes everything better.
*  You can fucking put anything in the pen and they'll hit it.
*  It's official. It's in the pen. Exactly.
*  It's a cartridge. It's free base.
*  It's glass dick. It's
*  free base and not as a motherfucker.
*  It's electric free base.
*  Which is pretty
*  next level. But I think
*  that's an entry level
*  DMT pen. Hit it once or twice.
*  Feel a little buzz.
*  You know? Dip your toes in.
*  Dip your toe. But if you're going to go,
*  you gotta go. Yeah.
*  You gotta go. Gotta go, go. Bye, bye.
*  Bye, bye.
*  That should be legal. They should be able to do that
*  at clinically approved places
*  where people who know how to take care
*  of people are there. Pay money to
*  do it. Helps the economy. Everybody
*  gets tax money. Yay.
*  Stop turning people into
*  babies. Stop allowing
*  grown adults to tell
*  you and
*  stop being a grown adult that wants to tell
*  another grown adult how to do something that's definitely
*  not going to kill them.
*  It's probably safer than 99%
*  of the things they're going to do. Yeah.
*  In terms of like alcohol, cigarettes,
*  opiates.
*  It's probably safer than all those things. It is.
*  And if you tell me not to do something, I'm definitely
*  going to do it. It doesn't make sense. You
*  shouldn't be allowed to tell somebody that they can't
*  It doesn't affect other people.
*  You shouldn't be allowed to tell people they can't do that.
*  That doesn't make any sense. But I think the deems
*  needs to stay the deems.
*  Anytime I've gotten the deemster,
*  it's been given to me.
*  It's been passed along from
*  a beautiful hand.
*  Right. Somebody wants you to experience it.
*  From a caring hand. It's never been like
*  money. It's not
*  anything like that. This is for experience
*  purposes here. Well, the thing is,
*  that is true. That is true. That is not
*  something that people are profiting from.
*  No, you don't sell that shit.
*  It has to be given as medicine to you.
*  That's true. I don't
*  think you've even heard of somebody buying it.
*  Which is really odd, right?
*  That's something that's like
*  that's crazy.
*  When you think about it, I mean I'm sure there's a
*  market for it. I guarantee. There's probably
*  some unscrupulous people that are selling it.
*  They probably don't even take it. There's probably a
*  market for it. It's probably not the good stuff.
*  There's good stuff and then there's shit.
*  There's ways of extraction.
*  A lot of people I know that have gotten it for free.
*  I think that
*  we just need to understand
*  that the people that are saying
*  these negative things about these
*  substances haven't experienced
*  them. It's just
*  I understand
*  why they would think what they think.
*  But they are saying that
*  based on a position
*  of not having experienced it.
*  And that just doesn't make any sense. It doesn't
*  make sense to them.
*  Because they think that they have the world defined
*  and that everything is logical.
*  And everything has a place and everything makes sense.
*  Once they do
*  that, that idea
*  goes away. That idea
*  goes away. But until they do that, they live in
*  this infantile state
*  of confidence in the
*  nature of reality.
*  Once you have that experience
*  then all of a sudden you go, okay.
*  No one
*  knows what the fuck is going on.
*  This is all crazy. And we're like all hyper
*  connected and
*  life changes
*  forever, instantaneously
*  all the time
*  based on how you interface with
*  it. And it's like this moving
*  breathing thing.
*  It's not static. And we're
*  all connected in some way that we don't have
*  the senses to detect.
*  And you don't get it until you
*  flood your brain with a naturally
*  occurring neuro chemical.
*  This neurotransmitter.
*  What's the technical
*  term for what DMT is? Whatever it is.
*  The psychedelic compound that you have
*  that your own brain makes. And when you get
*  it, then
*  and you get it while you're sleeping, you get it in your dreams
*  which is even nuttier. That's
*  the root of our dreams probably.
*  That's the number one theory.
*  Why we have these vivid, insane
*  like these things
*  that seem like they're real.
*  When you close your eyes, when you close your eyes
*  and you think of some shit, you could definitely
*  drift into a place if you've had that
*  experience before.
*  Yeah. Imagine if
*  every time you sleep, your
*  consciousness actually does go
*  somewhere else. What if you have a whole
*  another life
*  that operates in a different sort of time
*  realm? Like whatever
*  eight hours is to you while you're sleeping
*  it's different. But it's your
*  consciousness. Your consciousness leaves
*  your body, leaves the dimension.
*  And in eight hours of our time
*  returns. I mean I've had
*  those experiences where man
*  I was forced to wake up
*  like someone's chasing after
*  me in another realm and they got me
*  around the neck. And you wake up.
*  Bro I had a dream the other night of a dude
*  chasing people down the street with a battle axe.
*  Like an old school medieval battle
*  axe. Some dude, we could
*  see him, we were looking from the top
*  window and this guy was running down
*  the street in front of us with a battle axe.
*  I'm like I watch too much
*  Instagram.
*  Because yo that's
*  tough that you can totally see on Instagram. 100%.
*  Every time I fucking wake up I open
*  it. Did you see the dude with the machete fight?
*  I'm like we cut his hand off? Cut the dude's hand off
*  and the dude picked his hand up off the ground
*  and carried away? He kept going.
*  He kept fighting. Kept fighting with a hand chopped
*  off. He got his hand chopped off in a machete
*  fight. Bro machete fights are too
*  That is so crazy.
*  If you're pulling the machete out, why you got your hand
*  like that?
*  He's trying to keep his face from getting chopped off.
*  Yeah but you're going to block the machete like that?
*  He's doing anything to keep his head from getting chopped off.
*  I mean if it hits his neck he's dead.
*  And it's right there. It's an instinct.
*  You're just going to put your hand up there. Use the other
*  machete. Right.
*  If you can, you're correct. But sometimes
*  when people are slishing and a slashing
*  you gotta be real careful
*  where you place that thing. I've done
*  some of that, those weird knife
*  fighting like
*  where you get stabbed in 500 different
*  ways coming down.
*  I'm like man I'll never
*  be able to block any of this
*  shit. You're cutting, you're fucking
*  death by a little
*  million paper cuts. If somebody knows
*  how to do it you're in real trouble.
*  It's such a beautiful thing
*  too. To know
*  I want to know that.
*  Slice and dice.
*  Get in there.
*  The knife like this. It looks cool.
*  Like fucking Steven Seagal.
*  The only weapons I learned with the useless
*  ones like numchucks. I got good at that.
*  I love numchucks man.
*  I'll bring them backstage before the show
*  and just fucking get them
*  going. They're still fun.
*  I love, I mean I used to carry
*  numchucks on me back in the day
*  in my shorts.
*  I was 10 years old I had the numchucks outside.
*  Yeah we all did. Yeah. A lot
*  of kids had numchucks back then. Ninja
*  stars. Oh yeah.
*  From 42nd street in Times Square there
*  was a karate store.
*  Straight up karate store.
*  They sold bows,
*  fucking numchucks,
*  staffs, all kinds of
*  shit. Throwing stars.
*  Shurikens right?
*  Is that what Shuriken is?
*  From Street Fighter? Shuriken.
*  I don't know if that's what he's saying.
*  It might be a different word but Shuriken
*  is the name of a throwing star.
*  Or it's maybe a type of
*  throwing star. Maybe there's more than one.
*  So the dudes that made me those hammers,
*  those medieval hammers I swing,
*  they sent me two
*  Batman stars.
*  Like the new symbol of Batman
*  it's like crazy insignia.
*  I throw them. I'm fucking throwing them
*  at every cardboard box I have in
*  the studio. Oh my god.
*  It's sick. I fucking broke things
*  already. When I was a kid we always had throwing
*  stars. We'd throw them at trees.
*  We thought you were cool.
*  We'd stick to the tree.
*  So much fucking fun man.
*  Doing shit like that is fun.
*  It's crazy you could just buy those. You could basically buy
*  a throwing knife. One that's
*  easy to throw. You know you can buy
*  them anywhere. Throwing stars are easy to
*  throw. If you're good at a frisbee
*  you'd be very good at that fucking throwing
*  knife. Or you could go to fucking Home Depot
*  and get a saw blade
*  replacement.
*  Oh yeah you could fuck somebody up with a saw blade.
*  With the replacement though.
*  I saw a movie
*  where, or not a movie, a video
*  where a saw blade
*  broke off and slammed
*  into this house.
*  Right next to where this dude was standing.
*  Like the concrete saw blades? Like those ones that do the street?
*  Something broke off and it went
*  skittering across the street and
*  slammed into the house
*  right next to where this dude was standing just
*  a second ago.
*  Yeah.
*  You've seen it? You've seen it?
*  I can't, I can't look at
*  Twitter. I can't watch this shit.
*  So the guy goes inside the building and then look at this
*  blade. Oh no.
*  Watch this.
*  Look how crazy this is. As he
*  walks in? Yeah look. Oh my god.
*  I mean that is fucking
*  bonkers man. That thing is stuck
*  into the wall. That would have fucking took his legs off.
*  100%. Look how deep
*  it went into the wall. That had some
*  serious force behind it man. Where the fuck
*  did that come from? Good question.
*  Demons.
*  That's the only
*  answer is demons.
*  Demons are just causing little car accidents every now
*  and then just tripping your car.
*  Angels in the outfield.
*  Remember when fucking Danny Glover
*  they were helping him fucking catch the ball?
*  California Angels? Imagine.
*  Imagine Angels. They don't
*  have any time for the homeless. They're out there
*  fixing baseball games.
*  How dumb is that to think that the
*  Angels are going to help you with a baseball game?
*  They don't make movies like that anymore. It's a good
*  fucking movie. I've been talking to a lot of people
*  over the last few months which is
*  maybe not a good time for the direction my life is going.
*  But I've been talking to a lot of people over the last
*  few months that think that aliens are
*  angels. Angels and devils.
*  And that's like when you're
*  hearing about all those stories in the
*  Bible about fallen angels
*  and devils.
*  These people think that they
*  were referring to aliens.
*  That fell from the sky?
*  No. It's just the term
*  the way they're phrasing it
*  is like fallen angel meaning like
*  Satan. And that there's good
*  angels and bad angels. There's demons
*  and angels.
*  What these people believe
*  and I don't necessarily agree with it
*  nor do I even understand
*  it enough that I can argue against it. But they believe
*  that all these stories are really
*  referencing a spiritual force
*  that's always here all the time.
*  And sometimes exists in the physical
*  form. And
*  it might be
*  existing as
*  these things that we keep looking for.
*  Like aliens and
*  UFOs. It might be doing
*  that maybe
*  even to comfort us.
*  Or maybe to be more plausible.
*  Or maybe to hide the true nature
*  of what they are. So it
*  will present as if it's from another
*  planet. But really what it
*  is, is some sort of interdimensional
*  spiritual being.
*  That may or may not be
*  evil. It might be good. It might
*  be evil. And there might be a bunch of
*  different kinds out there in the world. But
*  that these stories
*  from like the ancient Hindu texts
*  and you know Billy Carson talks a lot about that.
*  And a bunch of other
*  people talk about these different stories
*  from these ancient texts
*  that have people
*  either interacting with sky
*  people or someone coming from
*  the sky and interacting with them.
*  And they think that
*  a lot of these things might be talking about
*  the same thing. And that these
*  aliens that people are encountering
*  there's some sort of an interdimensional
*  being that has essentially
*  always been here. I'll tell you who it is.
*  It's fucking John Travolta from that
*  movie. You ever see that movie where he's the angel?
*  Whatever. He's a fucking
*  angel. No, he has crazy hair.
*  No, this is a different John Travolta
*  movie. Michael. Michael.
*  When he's named Michael.
*  Bro, the hair
*  is nuts. Look at this.
*  Aliens
*  might be living among us
*  disguised as humans or in
*  a base inside the moon according to
*  a new Harvard study. Yo!
*  When this Harvard studies
*  is saying there might be a base inside
*  the moon. How wild
*  are things right now?
*  This is so crazy.
*  But none of this is, it's
*  not really that like shocking.
*  Right. It's not that shocking.
*  Once you have knowledge of
*  the other realm,
*  nothing's impossible.
*  Nothing in this life is impossible or
*  fucking shocking anymore. Well, it's still
*  shocking. It's shocking slightly.
*  Space is insane. This is
*  way less insane than what we know about space.
*  Space and water.
*  The deep, the deep sea is something that's
*  fucking as crazy as this to me.
*  As crazy and undiscovered.
*  It's fucking nuts. There is an end.
*  It stops. But does it really?
*  I think it does.
*  But the thing is, they don't know what the fuck is down there.
*  They're always finding a bunch of new cool fish.
*  That Mariana Trench?
*  Let me see what it says. The researchers have investigated
*  so-called crypto
*  terrestrials. These could
*  be disguising themselves as humans to
*  fit in, may come from Earth's
*  future, or might have descended
*  from intelligent dinosaurs.
*  This guy's from Harvard.
*  This guy got all the mushrooms.
*  They're probably doing a Harvard mushroom study and this
*  dude just stole the stock. Honestly,
*  the study was just to come up with an
*  answer. Like, give us some fucking answer.
*  The study was to create an
*  offer, excuse me,
*  the study was created to offer an alternative,
*  unconventional explanation
*  for UAP sightings,
*  and to hypothesize what they might mean
*  and the possibility that UAP may involve
*  forms of non-human intelligence that are
*  already present in Earth's environment in some
*  sense, that exists
*  alongside us in distinct
*  stealth. See, that could be if it's
*  here, but in a base.
*  But I think that our idea about
*  a base on the Moon or a base on
*  Mars, we're basing this
*  basing, no pun intended, this on the idea
*  that you have to go there to get there.
*  Like, if these things can travel
*  from other dimensions,
*  they probably don't need a base.
*  Like, they probably don't have a base.
*  They don't need a fucking base.
*  What do you need a base for? If they are some sort
*  of a spiritual being that's coming
*  here from another dimension,
*  and they're not necessarily coming here from
*  another planet, they probably don't need
*  your stupid base. And if
*  they're coming here from another planet, and they just
*  instantly have arrived, like,
*  why do we think they
*  need a base? Do they need a base to do that?
*  Like, who wants to have a base on the Moon?
*  Fuck that. Fuck your Moon. If I can
*  go from Orion
*  or whatever star system they're from,
*  Alpha Centauri or wherever the fuck they're from,
*  I can go there to Earth instantaneously.
*  Why do I want to stay on the Moon?
*  It's boring on the Moon. Yeah. There's nothing there.
*  Right. If I'm gonna go to Vegas,
*  am I gonna stop in Barstow
*  and get a hotel room? Or in Reno?
*  Yeah. Get the fuck out of here. You're not going to Reno.
*  I'm going straight through. Shut your mouth.
*  You're not a Reno kind of guy. You're not a Moon
*  base guy. I fucked that bullshit.
*  I'm here to go to Earth. The Moon is Reno.
*  Yeah. I'm going to
*  Montana, and I'm gonna mutilate
*  some cattle. I'd like to.
*  Those are the weird ones. Cattle
*  mutilations. You ever see those? What do you mean
*  mutilate them? Do you know what I mean? Alien
*  abductions and alien
*  sightings, a lot of times
*  in the areas where these happen,
*  one other thing that happens in the
*  phenomenon is cow
*  mutilations. Like maiming? So these cows
*  that have been surgically operated,
*  it looks like they're surgically operated on,
*  and they're drained of their blood.
*  Really weird stuff.
*  Where some of the organs have been removed,
*  it looks like with surgical precision. Which ones?
*  I don't know, because
*  the liver? It's not happened just
*  once. It's happened multiple times, so
*  I think it's a bunch of different ways
*  things have happened. Wow, that fucking shit looks like it's been sucked
*  out of it. Look at this. Not one drop
*  of blood. Cattle mysteriously
*  mutilated in Oregon. It's not just
*  one instance of this happening.
*  This has happened- It's the fucking chupacabra.
*  That's the fucking
*  chupacabra right there. You know what a chupacabra
*  is, right? You know what it really is? What is it? It's a coyote
*  with mange. Oh, is it? Yeah,
*  probably. Or a bobcat with mange.
*  What the fuck is mange?
*  Mange is a disease that makes
*  animals lose their fur.
*  So it's like this horrible-
*  alopecia. Yeah, yeah.
*  This horrible, like, cracked, fucked up
*  skin, because their skin is not used to be in the sun.
*  It's mostly protected by all that fur.
*  Skin's all dried and cracked up.
*  I had a friend who had a chicken coop
*  and
*  their chicken coop got attacked by a
*  bobcat. They got like a security photo
*  of it, and this thing looked like
*  a demon. It was fucked up, huh? It was a bobcat
*  with mange. And it's like
*  half of its fur was messed up.
*  It was like so hungry it's breaking into the
*  chicken coop. It looks so
*  creepy. So that's what it is.
*  1970s cow mutilation mystery.
*  When ranchers began reporting
*  incidents of mutilated cattle,
*  the ensuing panic fed both conspiracy
*  theories and a growing cynicism
*  about the government. Yeah, but it's not just
*  the 70s. I mean, these things have happened in
*  the 2000s. But it looked like
*  it was literally, like, floppy.
*  There was nothing inside of that fucking carcass.
*  And just skin. The thing is
*  that's not unique. There's been a bunch
*  of them that they've found that are weird like
*  that, where they have, like, surgically
*  precise cuts
*  in them. And they're missing stuff.
*  Are they sewn back up or left?
*  Look at this. The army had
*  accidentally killed more than 4,500
*  sheep in 1968, while
*  testing nerve agents in Utah.
*  Then refused to
*  acknowledge its responsibility until
*  1998. Those fucking cunts.
*  They gave it a secret for 30
*  years. 30 years later, like, oh yeah,
*  you remember those sheep? Yeah, we killed them. Sorry.
*  Tested nerve gas.
*  I was driving a Maroon Jetta in
*  98. Most likely what, Jamie? Coyotes,
*  magpies, badgers.
*  Yeah, not buying it. I've
*  seen these people, and I know how these
*  people think, too. There's a bunch of people
*  that they call themselves debunkers.
*  But really what they are is true believers
*  in one view. And this
*  true belief is that it has
*  to be a coyote, or because
*  aliens aren't real. But it might
*  not even be an alien. It might be some sort
*  of government agency
*  that's involved in some sort of an experimental
*  weapon. I don't know what they're doing.
*  No one's saying it's necessarily
*  alien. Whatever
*  is happening to the cows, though, is very
*  weird if you're getting all their blood
*  removed from their body and surgical
*  cuts, and then their tissue isn't eaten
*  by animals. It's not like
*  if they were chewed up
*  and something looked real
*  precise but the rest of it looked all fucked up. No.
*  These animals are drained of their blood
*  with no blood on the ground, and it doesn't
*  make any sense. No, forget about
*  the alien thing. Let's pretend
*  that's not even a real thing, that no one believes
*  in aliens. So tell me what the fuck
*  happened to that cow, because that doesn't make sense
*  that that's happening from a coyote. It doesn't
*  look like it. It doesn't seem like it.
*  No animal did that. It doesn't look like an animal did it.
*  Are there any animals
*  that kill with precision
*  besides a tiger and shit like that with the bites?
*  But no one opens you up.
*  No. That's a... One animal does.
*  Human. And so, I
*  would imagine if you looked at
*  something like that, we'd say, who could be doing something like
*  that? Well, we could do it. It's not like
*  building a pyramid. We could
*  kill a cow and do that if we wanted to. You have enough
*  people, have enough equipment.
*  Why? So why would someone do that?
*  What are they doing?
*  If I wanted to practice on some fucking
*  weapon that I could just send out
*  and say, go get me a person's liver.
*  And this thing like hunts
*  you down and tackles
*  you and hangs onto you and cuts you open
*  and snatches out your liver and then sucks
*  all your blood into a vacuum tube,
*  seals it up, and then drops you and
*  crumples. That's what that cow looks like.
*  Like, I would imagine, before I would think
*  aliens are killing cows for
*  no reason, I would imagine that it's
*  probably some wacky human weapon
*  that they could do some wild shit.
*  And how do you test it on mammals?
*  Well, go get a cow.
*  They're all wandering around. They get killed
*  by coyotes. Blame it on
*  wolverines. Yeah, that's right.
*  Blame it on everything else. Like, just go
*  unleash this weapon.
*  Those fucking flying pods Terrence
*  Howard was talking about.
*  Imagine one of those with like razor blades
*  everywhere. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, just fucking
*  tearing you the fuck up and then the arm comes
*  in. Yeah.
*  And then he fucking closes you up.
*  Sutures. I would imagine,
*  look, they try to
*  come up with so many weapons.
*  You don't think they would have a weapon that would like
*  disembowel you and draw
*  your blood out? Of course they would.
*  They were trying to come up with a gay bomb.
*  What the fuck?
*  Yes. The government had
*  spent millions of dollars
*  trying to develop a gay
*  bomb. And the way the gay, I don't know
*  about millions of dollars. We might have to double check that.
*  But what the gay bomb would do is they would drop
*  it over a city and turn everyone gay.
*  And guys just start banging each other
*  and they just get demoralized. They didn't want to fight
*  anymore.
*  That's some fucking, that's
*  some crazy warfare. That's not fair.
*  How sick do you have
*  to be to be working for the
*  United States government so you're working for
*  the people? You're supposed to be a patriot.
*  And you're sitting there
*  thinking, how do we
*  get these people in a humane way?
*  We don't want to kill the entire population.
*  But how do we stop them from fighting?
*  Make them a bunch of queers.
*  Did you ever see that Sacha Baron Cohen
*  shit? Which one?
*  About America where he's Iran
*  the fucking Israeli fucking
*  special forces and he's
*  holding up the pork at the Muslim
*  terrorists and fucking
*  going backwards with his ass?
*  Yo, some of the crazy
*  shit you've ever seen in your life, these are tactics
*  that are, can you please
*  look that up? Hold on a second. For god's sake.
*  In 2008 the US military
*  confirmed that an Ohio
*  Air Force laboratory requested
*  7.5 million dollars
*  to develop a non-lethal gay
*  bomb. The weapon
*  would release hormones through the skin or
*  lungs to make enemy
*  soldiers sexually attracted
*  to each other, distracting
*  them from fighting. The project
*  was also known as the Make
*  Love Not War Initiative.
*  Who in the fuck, who
*  set this up? I don't
*  know. Who set this initiative
*  up? BMJ authors, they won
*  a prize. What did they win
*  a prize for? For trying to come up
*  with a gay bomb?
*  How did they win a prize?
*  It says it's been scrapped.
*  Oh, scrapped now? Yeah, because people found out about it.
*  Shit.
*  Imagine, imagine
*  you got 7.5 million dollars
*  to do, that's what you want to do.
*  What do you guys want to try to make?
*  Let's try to make a gay bomb.
*  How would you even find out
*  if it would work? Sick motherfuckers
*  doing that. You would have to get a volunteer
*  that didn't know you were trying to turn them gay.
*  Because if you're going to find out if it really works,
*  you can't tell a guy, hey, we're going to give you this stuff,
*  tell me if you feel gay.
*  And he's like, god damn, I feel gay.
*  And then he probably might be gay for real, and just blames
*  it on the drug.
*  There it is. When really, he's just gay.
*  And he's just scared to say it. He's like, you drugged me!
*  No, I'm gay! God damn it!
*  I can't even wrap my head around this right now.
*  You'd have to not tell him that you're doing it to him.
*  That sounds like it's fake, bro.
*  The gay bomb
*  sounds so crazy. I want you to imagine
*  that you're a college student, and you're broke.
*  And medical experiment, yeah, I'll try that.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You're the guy who goes through and they dose you up
*  with the gay bomb.
*  Hopefully they hit me with that fucking, what's the other,
*  what's the... Ozempic?
*  No.
*  What's the fake one?
*  In vitro or in vitro?
*  When they give you the fake shit.
*  Yeah, the placebo. I want that.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd have to take a risk. 50-50.
*  I've seen heads that are on Ozempic,
*  they don't look good, man. It doesn't seem like...
*  It looks like that cow. I don't think you should.
*  They've had all their blood drained to them, and they're just a
*  bag of meat. That's what they look like
*  to me. Yeah. And then they have these
*  big faces and skinny bodies
*  because their face and shoulders get small,
*  but their head grows when you get big.
*  Yeah. Look like fucking
*  Stewie. This came from an article in
*  2007 where it talks about some other wild spending
*  ideas they had.
*  The gay bomb is crazy.
*  Boston University developed brain implants
*  that could steer shark-like dogfish
*  with a phantom odor.
*  Wow.
*  This is all sci-fi.
*  Well, I mean, I imagine... Dogfish.
*  The military, it says the military has a lot
*  of crazy ideas, but it's hard to
*  turn these things into, these ideas
*  into action. Right. But
*  if you would, you know, if the
*  military's open-minded, that's a good thing.
*  Look at that next thing. To consider everything.
*  What? Fucking taxpayer
*  $50,000 per second.
*  What?
*  This is why I gotta get the hell out of New York,
*  because they're using my money for this fucking shit.
*  Look at this.
*  That is the craziest thing I've ever read.
*  In her book Imaginary Weapons, military expert
*  Sharon Weinberger writes
*  that the federal government is spending taxpayer
*  money on the war technology
*  at a pace of about
*  $50,000 per second.
*  That just made me angry for some reason,
*  like I give a shit, but it made me angry.
*  The government spends $50,000 a second on war technology.
*  Look at that.
*  $78 billion on weird shit.
*  Wow.
*  Half of all government research
*  and development dollars on a variety of projects
*  according to the American Association
*  for Advancement of Science.
*  I definitely have some ideas for some
*  weird weapons.
*  That was like 15 years ago. That's crazy.
*  Oh my god.
*  You take the bottom of a Timberland boot,
*  you wrap duct tape around the foot bed,
*  and you just fucking hit someone with the heel.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's not good against drones.
*  Throw it.
*  Once they release the drones.
*  See, I'm not good at the computer.
*  Anything with computers.
*  I like driving a stick shift.
*  I like cars with fucking AM, FM radio.
*  Right.
*  I hear ya.
*  I've been listening to AM radio forever.
*  660, man.
*  That's that WFAN shit I was telling you about.
*  When I get in a dude's car and he's got AM radio on,
*  I just get suspicious.
*  He might be a prepper.
*  If it was like AM political talk radio,
*  you might be a prepper.
*  AM political talk is no good.
*  But if you listen to the Knicks game on like...
*  Oh, that's good.
*  If you can't be at the game or you can't be watching,
*  you're working, you can hear it,
*  that's the thing that that sport has
*  lost, right?
*  Boxing used to have that.
*  Can I tell you what I'd like in UFC?
*  I would like to hear your guys' commentary.
*  In little headphones, in like a little transistor.
*  They used to have that.
*  I really think that would make a big difference.
*  I sit there for seven hours every time I go.
*  And you know,
*  I would love to hear what you guys are saying.
*  Because it really does help.
*  I wonder if you could do this.
*  Because the fact that
*  if you let
*  the audio just play
*  on an app,
*  then there's a bunch of people that might buy
*  the pay-per-view, but they won't buy the pay-per-view,
*  they'll just listen to the audio on the app.
*  Just in arena.
*  But if you geolocate it,
*  turn on your location services, and it proves
*  you're inside T-Mobile Arena,
*  then you can put your earbuds in, and you can listen to the commentary.
*  That's what I want.
*  Because that way you can find out what the corner man said to him.
*  If someone's foot is hurt.
*  That's what I'm saying. There's all kinds of things that you hear about later.
*  Like, he broke his hand, or he broke his foot.
*  We have no idea.
*  Right, when you're live, sometimes it's chaos.
*  I mean, sometimes it's chaos for us.
*  We're like, what happened?
*  And it takes like a second, and maybe we...
*  You know, if someone's back is to you,
*  and you're watching the fight, and all of a sudden their head flies back,
*  you don't even know what hit them.
*  No, but you do bring the information once you gather it,
*  and then we're sitting there, you know, and the fight will be over.
*  And like, did you hear that he broke his hand?
*  Or did you hear this?
*  Right. You gotta find out live in the moment.
*  I mean, that was recent. Like, someone broke their foot, or their hand in the fight,
*  and we didn't find out until after.
*  I can't remember who though.
*  Yeah, the UFC should probably do something like that.
*  That would be cool.
*  They just turn it on if you're in the location.
*  Because they can do shit like that now.
*  But you would have to let the government spy on your phone.
*  Whatever, if I get to listen to the fucking...
*  They could have that one.
*  If I get to listen to the commentary, I'm fine.
*  Yeah, I've gone live before, and I miss the commentary too.
*  It just seems kind of empty.
*  It seems weird.
*  It's like so weird, like I'm so used to watching fights while talking.
*  Like I've seen more fights while talking probably than I have without talking.
*  It's just nuts.
*  That's a nutty thing.
*  I don't think, it might not be, it's probably like 50-50 at this point,
*  because I watch so many fights.
*  I watch a bunch of different organizations too.
*  Bro, there's killers all over the world now.
*  I was watching some dudes fight in this Octagon event.
*  They do have it on Sirius now.
*  Oh, let's go.
*  I wonder if you could have Sirius running inside, like if you had your AirPods on.
*  Right, if you have the Sirius app.
*  If you have the app.
*  Because Sirius is basically like a podcast network too now.
*  I mean, it's also satellite radio, but they have the app, right?
*  Can you watch Howard Stern live on the app?
*  I just want, it would be deleted now.
*  No main pay-per-view cards.
*  Oh, no main pay-per-view cards?
*  Fight nights and preliminary fights, that's fine, but I would like the main.
*  It's good for now.
*  During the pay-per-view.
*  Yeah, but I've got to be during.
*  I would imagine they'd make some sort of situation where you could pay for that as well.
*  Where you get the extended version.
*  Yeah, and if they just did that, like for people that are at work,
*  or something like that where you can't see it.
*  I've been listening to fights also.
*  That's what they used to look like.
*  Oh, that's right, that's what they used to look like.
*  Why did they stop though?
*  Is that a watch?
*  It's like a walkie-talkie type thing.
*  It's a little thing and you plug in some headphones into it,
*  and then you'd be sitting in the audience and you'd listen to the commentary.
*  There it is, it's already there, let's do it.
*  I'll ask Dana what the fuck happened.
*  Tell them please.
*  I need that.
*  Yeah, I'll ask Dana what the fuck happened.
*  They were dope.
*  You wanted to listen to the fights, but then you have all these batteries and radios.
*  Yeah, it's all fucked up.
*  You wanted to go through an app.
*  But I do want to be driving like I do with Yankee games, or with any games,
*  and listen to the fights when I want.
*  I have it on ESPN Plus, plugged into the car, I'm not watching but I'm listening.
*  That's one way to do it.
*  But the fucking, it's shaky sometimes.
*  The stream sucks.
*  I don't want to miss anything.
*  Depends on what your service is, right?
*  If you get some good vibes, you can watch it.
*  I got garbage.
*  I still have Sprint.
*  Why do you have Sprint?
*  I'm loyal, bro.
*  25 years.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Oh man.
*  That's hilarious.
*  This fucking guy had me going crazy today, man.
*  Yeah, dude, we put in some work today.
*  Bro.
*  My lord.
*  That was dope, but the sauna really took it out of me.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never been baked before.
*  I was slow roasted today.
*  You should get one of those.
*  I will.
*  It's good for you.
*  In that cold, I feel like I could do again tomorrow, maybe get more than 55 seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I did.
*  The first time I did it, I did like a minute and 20 something seconds.
*  And then I did like 4 minutes, and then I did 20 minutes.
*  Just because I wanted to see what I could do.
*  The sauna is special though.
*  It's hard, man.
*  Especially at that temperature.
*  You don't have to do that temperature though.
*  That was an extreme temp?
*  Yeah, yeah. 190 is pretty extreme.
*  Most people don't like 190.
*  She was burning my nostrils.
*  Most people like it around like...
*  I was like, is this okay?
*  It's like you're about to fucking go on fire.
*  When you feel like the hot air coming in,
*  and your body's like, what are you doing?
*  Most people like, I think,
*  at like 170, 175.
*  That's a zone where it's like uncomfortable, but not crazy.
*  But I got too used to that.
*  I just got comfortable,
*  and I'm like, I want to be a little bit more uncomfortable.
*  And I kept going until I settled around 195, 196.
*  So today I did your fucking...
*  Yeah.
*  Where you're at.
*  Yeah. What you did for 10 minutes.
*  10 minutes is where it gets hard.
*  The first few minutes it's not bad at all.
*  No, no, I thought I was going to be able to do it.
*  It's no big deal.
*  And then 10 minutes in you're like, oh boy.
*  This is a real problem.
*  And you gave me that fucking thing.
*  And I threw up today.
*  The Lucy. Yeah.
*  Those are big boy nicotine pouches.
*  The nicotine pouch was like this big.
*  Yeah, it's 8 milligrams.
*  Bro. Yeah.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  I lost myself today.
*  I lost myself.
*  They don't give me the hiccups.
*  I've never gotten the hiccups with these Lucy's.
*  I've only tried it once though.
*  I only get hiccups if I eat rice without water.
*  Oh, that'll do it.
*  Fuck is that?
*  Take a spoonful of flour.
*  No more carbs for me also.
*  After today I'm done. Fuck this. Watch.
*  Come on. You can do it.
*  Oh, bro. I got to get on the flight now.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you do. You really got to go.
*  Alright, let's wrap this up.
*  Listen, dude, you're awesome.
*  I always love hanging out with you. You're the fucking man.
*  You're so much fun. We had a great time today.
*  Always. It was a real fun time.
*  And shout out to our man's barbecue.
*  Because god damn was that good.
*  KG barbecue.
*  Young Egyptian.
*  Incredible. So delicious.
*  And so unique.
*  The flavors, the way he uses them.
*  His special take on all these different things.
*  With different spices.
*  Insane. Very good.
*  And he's got an Instagram. So what is his Instagram?
*  KGBarbecue.
*  Awesome. He's got a lot of great food.
*  Dude, you're the fucking man. Catch your flight. I love you. Appreciate you.
*  You're the best. Bye, everybody.
