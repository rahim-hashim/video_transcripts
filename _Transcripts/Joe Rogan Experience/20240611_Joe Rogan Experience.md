# Joe Rogan Experience #2162 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJyYFFydVPM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Showing by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Dude, I get it now.
*  You get it.
*  I get it. I get the whole thing.
*  You see how powerful you feel?
*  Yeah, you feel like you can talk shit, like you're in another dimension.
*  All the things that you do, like working out and succeeding, you don't need to really do a lot of that.
*  If you put these on, you get a lot of the effects of like being a trained fighter and all that crap.
*  If you just put these on, you kind of get the idea of that until someone calls you out and kills you.
*  Yeah, you got to avoid like actual conflict.
*  You got to run away.
*  But you do feel superior to people.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Like you have a suit on or something.
*  Yeah, it keeps you away.
*  There's a distance between you and other people now.
*  That must be why celebrities wear them when they go out.
*  Probably.
*  You know, like we'll see like at concerts or UFC fights, you'll see celebrities with full on sunglasses.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like a cat hiding underneath a chair and the tail's hanging out.
*  It's like, you can't see me, but I can see you, stupid.
*  Yeah. No, people, they do give you some, and a lot of people, I guess, are on drugs.
*  Yeah, that's probably why.
*  And then their eyes are bugged out of their head.
*  I just think they're trying to avoid eye contact with people.
*  Because then people give them a script.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  They just don't want to be left alone.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if you want to be left alone in public, maybe that's the only way to do it.
*  You just got to put these things.
*  And they're getting bigger and bigger.
*  These are so huge.
*  They're crazy.
*  This is like a rich lady who gets out of a car with a small dog.
*  They're crazy.
*  And you wear them.
*  And when I got them, I got them as a joke.
*  But then you just keep doing it.
*  Because they're good.
*  Because they're good.
*  They're actually fun.
*  And people come up to you and say nice things about the sunglasses.
*  Which is weird.
*  Which is weird.
*  They'll go, these sunglasses are really cool.
*  And like cool people.
*  Like black people.
*  You know what I mean?
*  A black guy will go, those shades are cool.
*  And I'll go, that's great.
*  If a guy like me says it means nothing, I would throw them out.
*  But...
*  Well, this is like a bad sunglasses from the 80s.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what Brian Bosworth used to wear.
*  Do you remember the Bos?
*  I don't.
*  He was the guy who was famous for his sunglasses.
*  He was a big time football player.
*  Interesting.
*  He was one of those...
*  You know, every now and then one of those fellas like...
*  What's his name?
*  The one that's dating Taylor Swift?
*  Travis Kelsey.
*  That guy.
*  Like when one of those guys breaks through and becomes famous, that was the Bos.
*  Oh wow!
*  See?
*  Those are corny as shit in 2000.
*  But here we are in 2024.
*  They're back.
*  Invest in Bell Bottoms, kids.
*  They're absolutely back.
*  They're absolutely back.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he had a mullet too.
*  Everything comes back.
*  The handsome bastard.
*  Mullets are back.
*  Yeah, mullets are back.
*  Theo probably helped with that.
*  Yeah, big time.
*  And lesbians.
*  Theo and lesbians.
*  There's not enough new ideas.
*  You gotta recycle certain ideas.
*  After a while you go, the mohawks not that bad.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  What's the problem?
*  Everything was baggy and then everything was tight and now everything's getting baggy again.
*  Yeah.
*  The ladies are wearing baggy pants.
*  A lot of people are wearing baggy stuff, but then that'll probably be the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think it's a problem.
*  I think it's a problem.
*  I think it's a problem.
*  I think it's a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't get it.
*  Go back to the tight stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  That looks better.
*  Well, they feel no one can objectify them if they wear a bag.
*  Yet they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll go to the gym in yoga pants.
*  That's right.
*  That are so thin you could literally read braille through them.
*  Right.
*  And you see your full vagina out.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just hanging out.
*  And a lot of these gals are not wearing panties because they don't want the line.
*  I don't want there to be a line.
*  So they have just raw pussy covered by yoga pants out there in the wild.
*  We're kind of lucky as comedians to wear pretty much.
*  Like you dress up in a suit for UFC and for other stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But most of us don't.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't mind a suit.
*  I like it.
*  I wear it if I have to go somewhere special.
*  Yeah.
*  Throw a suit on.
*  Right.
*  You know, I don't mind it.
*  Sebastian's into it.
*  Boy, that guy.
*  They wear it.
*  I saw Seinfeld at Gotham.
*  He's in it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  People wear them.
*  Baleni wears one.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm certain you feel like you're some sort of an expert.
*  For sure.
*  You know, you're definitely better than the guy in the hoodie.
*  Yes.
*  The guy in the hoodie is a fucking idiot.
*  I agree.
*  But I'm the guy in the hoodie and I agree with that.
*  Yeah, I agree too.
*  Like when I see Seinfeld, I go, I agree that you are.
*  And it's not even fashion.
*  He's better in every way.
*  I wear hoodies three days a week.
*  It's fun to wear a hoodie and jeans.
*  Yeah.
*  It's casual.
*  It's a great...
*  It's loose.
*  I feel comfortable.
*  It's a great thing to just...
*  It's soft.
*  You know, you can make money in a hoodie's great.
*  Yes.
*  That's the cool thing about it.
*  Yes.
*  To have jeans on and go, I'm going to make money in a hoodie and jeans.
*  I think that's what John Fetterman was getting into when he went into the Congress.
*  That's what he was doing.
*  Look, if I'm going to be rich now, I'm going to dress like what I would dress like if I
*  was like Rick Rubin.
*  He's kind of an interesting guy now because now he's starting to make sense, which is
*  strange.
*  Yeah, what the fuck is going on?
*  Did the stroke knock some sense into him?
*  I don't know what happened, but he's like actually coming out of the gate with some
*  like very rational things.
*  Yeah, hot, good takes on everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, on everything.
*  And I'm like, if that's what sweatpants does, let's do it.
*  I wonder if like when he was running, he was recovering from the stroke.
*  And so that was why he would have those moments where his brain would sink off and we'd be
*  like, this guy's fucked.
*  He can't be a senator.
*  Right.
*  But maybe what it really is is just takes a while for everything to come back and now
*  it's all back.
*  Right.
*  Now he's making sense.
*  I've seen those videos since of him.
*  You know, there was a few videos where it was like me if I eat like a 500 milligram edible.
*  He was out of it for a period of time.
*  He was gone.
*  He was he was in this place where it just didn't make sense what he was saying.
*  Yeah.
*  But now he's back and it feels like from my perspective that the things he's saying are
*  pretty logical.
*  What a crazy political move.
*  Yeah.
*  Recover from a stroke publicly.
*  Right.
*  While in the middle of a campaign.
*  In a sweatsuit.
*  Against a guy who's famous.
*  Right.
*  And still win.
*  And still win.
*  And then get progressively better and make more sense because our guy that's the president
*  is getting worse and Federman's getting better.
*  I'm of the opinion and I think you are too.
*  Yeah.
*  Biden doesn't exist.
*  I believe.
*  It could be the first AI thing.
*  I think he's a living human being.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But there's nothing there.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  So I think every I don't think there's a question about this.
*  Right.
*  So everything around him is with supporting the country which is kind of crazy.
*  Right.
*  Kind of shows you that the system kind of works.
*  Sure.
*  You know when you got a guy like that it's a great kind of stress test to see like what
*  happens.
*  Yeah.
*  You get a guy that's just going.
*  And also how much you can gaslight people into voting for him again.
*  Yes.
*  How much you can gaslight people into voting for the people around him again is what it
*  really is.
*  The people you don't even know.
*  But this mysterious cabal of humans is actually running the country.
*  Well it's such a weird thing because he came out at the State of the Union.
*  He was pretty good but he was heavily drugged like something.
*  And you might know more than I know about like certain types of things that you can
*  do like what you've had all these doctors on and stuff.
*  Is there a way to make that guy like that for the debates?
*  Is he going to be able to because now he wasn't great.
*  What I would recommend is I would find I would time it correctly.
*  Right.
*  So I'd recommend that he got lots of sleep.
*  I would cut all the ice cream out of his diet for several days.
*  Right.
*  All the bullshit out of his diet.
*  Then I would give him NAD infusions and IV vitamin infusions multiple days in a row like
*  three or four days in a row.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the day of I would make sure that he eats really well, gets a lot of sleep,
*  and then I would fill him up.
*  I'd fill him up with Adderall.
*  I'd give him testosterone.
*  I would give him human growth hormone.
*  I'd give him nootropics.
*  I'd give him everything that we know that creatine helps with.
*  It actually does help.
*  I'm sure it does.
*  Creatine is a cognitive enhancer.
*  I'm thinking of him getting all these injections in that skin.
*  Creatine just supplements.
*  Just that purple skin from all the marks.
*  Oh, God.
*  That skin that's just wound so thin, it's spun so thin on his body, all of the bruising
*  from all of these needles of stuff that they need to shoot him up with to just be coherent
*  for an hour.
*  Isn't it crazy when Obama was president, the worst they could get on him is remember when
*  he wore that tan suit?
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  He never had a single moment publicly where he stumbled, where he said something really
*  stupid.
*  No, this is like...
*  This is insane.
*  This is insane.
*  It's much worse than even, you know, remember George W. Bush?
*  And he would like, you know, say silly things.
*  Yeah.
*  This is like so far down the road from that.
*  It's so far down the road.
*  It's so far down the road that it's like, I think it's elder abuse.
*  I really do.
*  I mean, if it was any other job, it would be elder abuse.
*  Yeah.
*  If there was a guy who was running the corner grocery store and his family was making him
*  run it and he was that old and they had money, you'd be like, what the fuck are you doing
*  to your dad?
*  Why are you making your dad work?
*  Your dad's out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would you do...
*  Yeah.
*  There was a guy in New York, this legendary guy Dom, who ran this pizzeria called DeFaraz,
*  which is like widely thought of as the best pizza in New York.
*  And he was so old.
*  And at the very end, he was just over the pie with the oil and cutting basil.
*  And it was like, you felt bad because the pie was amazing, but you're watching a guy
*  at the end of his life.
*  Making pizza.
*  Making pizza.
*  Very old.
*  And he would struggle.
*  He'd put it in the thing.
*  It was hard.
*  It was like you kind of gasped.
*  And that's what we have now, except it's with Russia.
*  But however, if I went to a pizza place and there's a guy who loves making pizza so much
*  that here he's fucking dying.
*  Right.
*  It's his last days.
*  He's still, I'm going to make you a nice pie.
*  Yes.
*  I'm going to make you a nice pie.
*  And he fought.
*  But he must love the fact that his pizza is awesome.
*  Yes, he loved it.
*  If you make good food, it's probably a lot like killing.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You know?
*  For sure.
*  Like you kill on stage.
*  Everybody loves it.
*  We had a great time.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm so happy you guys had fun.
*  You don't wonder what the reward is for Biden.
*  Like, is it even fun?
*  It can't be fun.
*  It can't be fun.
*  Why does he even want to do this?
*  That guy making that pizza, when someone folds a slice of that pie and goes, oh my god.
*  They're into it.
*  It's like they're killing.
*  And that guy goes, I've made all of these people happy.
*  Yes.
*  But this guy, I mean, this just came out in the Wall Street Journal where they're saying
*  that he's like showing signs like behind closed doors.
*  Wait, what are you saying?
*  I know.
*  It's shocking.
*  This is crazy.
*  It's shocking.
*  It's what?
*  When President Biden met with congressional leaders in the West Wing in January to negotiate
*  Ukraine funding deal, he spoke so softly at times and some participants struggled to hear
*  him.
*  According to five people similar, familiar rather with the meeting, he read from notes
*  to make obvious points, pause for extended periods and sometimes close his eyes for so
*  long that some of the room wondered whether he had tuned out.
*  Or died.
*  But are they, they can't change him out now.
*  Right?
*  You and I both thought it was going to happen in May.
*  We were convinced.
*  I remember texting you.
*  I was convinced.
*  I actually heard from people that were kind of, you know, around the Trump campaign that
*  also preparing to run against somebody who wasn't Biden.
*  Right.
*  And they had believed that they were like, it's going to be Newsome or somebody and it
*  hasn't been.
*  So why not to sound like a nut, but why are they so why are they so committed to this
*  guy?
*  There's something weird about there's something strange about it.
*  Do you think that's it?
*  I think he's the sitting president and they gaslit everybody into thinking he was fine.
*  So now they would have to change course radically to justify getting him out of office.
*  If they just had, they just published an article, I think it was in the Times that was talking
*  about Biden saying that his age is his superpower.
*  Did you see that?
*  Yes.
*  And then Seth, what's his name?
*  The guy from the fucking family guy?
*  Seth McFarland.
*  That guy retweeted it.
*  Right.
*  And was like, this is amazing.
*  I couldn't have written this better thing.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  His age is a superpower.
*  So you'd have to turn that back.
*  So you'd have to get all these people.
*  Do you remember when there was a whole list of a bunch of celebrities?
*  They used to make videos where they would tell you what to do.
*  Right.
*  You know, what we need to do.
*  We write to the end of democracy.
*  Remember the bunch of them did that before the 2016 election?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Those people, of all, you'd have to do something like that with Biden.
*  Well, what's interesting about Biden is they put him in kind of because they kind of stacked
*  the Democratic primary.
*  They killed the momentum of Sanders.
*  And there was a lot of people.
*  Biden was like very behind and then sprung out at the end.
*  They manipulated it.
*  They manipulated it.
*  Just like they did with Hillary.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like Donna Brazile wrote about in her book.
*  They manipulated it to get him in.
*  And it's just weird to me that when everyone sees it so clearly and Trump is up in every
*  poll, why they wouldn't just have him go out, give a very patriotic speech about, you know
*  what, I thought I could do it, but now I can't.
*  I thought I was OK.
*  Because there's no one other than her.
*  So if you try to put her in again, if you try to promote her as president to against
*  Trump, Democrats are going to vote for Trump.
*  She should lose one more time.
*  But she's going to lose in a way that's crazy.
*  No, I know.
*  It's crazy.
*  No, they have nobody else.
*  That's the other thing.
*  But the thing is, he should lose in a way that's crazy if you're looking at like competence
*  because he's so old.
*  But people will vote for him just because the machine behind him has kept the country
*  it's still relatively OK.
*  You're still going out to dinner.
*  You're still taking plane flights for the time being.
*  No aliens have landed.
*  Not yet.
*  Ukraine hasn't spilled over in North America.
*  It's all OK.
*  Not yet.
*  Kind of.
*  Kind of.
*  Right?
*  So you would probably, especially if you're one of those celebrities that made that video
*  about Trump, you can't turn course now.
*  Those people, that's out there forever.
*  Remember those?
*  Imagine those, There's No Heaven?
*  Yeah.
*  Remember that one?
*  I think older people kind of like, some of them like it because they go, yeah, well,
*  good for him.
*  There's a lot of older people that don't want to step down.
*  Like when white guys want a white heavyweight hockey champion.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And there's a lot of old people that go, I'm not going to retire.
*  I'm not going to step down.
*  I don't want to go into assisted living.
*  Remember Frankie, he made that pie till the day he died.
*  Till the day he died.
*  He was 102 years old.
*  He put the basil on, drop dead.
*  I think they want, they look at this guy and they say, good for him.
*  He's one of us.
*  There's a little bit of that going on.
*  He's one of us.
*  I definitely think there's a little bit of that going on.
*  I don't think that's Trump will beat him.
*  I think from jail.
*  Yeah.
*  100% Trump will win.
*  Yeah, but I don't know if it's real.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I mean, look, I don't want to cry election fraud, but why would I imagine that they would
*  manipulate everything openly except the election?
*  But this is what I, you know what I'm saying?
*  But this is what I'm saying to you.
*  Is it not possible that they haven't gone off Joe Biden because there was some fuckery
*  in the last election?
*  Well, is it not possible to some degree that they have this rabid insistence on this clearly
*  dementia ridden guy because their promises have been made and there are people in positions
*  of power that could speak?
*  I don't know anything.
*  I'm just, that's a possibility.
*  I mean, it's just a guess, right?
*  Who knows?
*  I'm just asking the kinds of questions that people on Twitter will call me a name for
*  asking.
*  But you gotta stop reading that.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  That's why I don't read it.
*  Boy, that's a nice once you once you break your mind.
*  I know I'm not on it as much.
*  You feel so much better.
*  Lex goes into a dark hole every few days.
*  I know.
*  Well, it's you know, I hope he doesn't read the stuff about the Kevin Spacey interview.
*  Life is dark.
*  Oh, he's interviewing Spacey.
*  He did.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn it.
*  We wanted Spacey.
*  You can get Spacey.
*  I know.
*  But then you're on the fifth person to have Spacey.
*  You'll be the most fun.
*  I know Weinstein's coming here first.
*  I know you're going to have him as soon as he gets out of jail.
*  He's never getting out of jail.
*  I hope he does.
*  I don't think he's ever getting out of jail.
*  By the way, he should.
*  Isn't he in jail for the rest of his life?
*  No, it's turning around, Joe.
*  What do you mean?
*  It's turning around.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Oh, you don't know?
*  What?
*  What's going on?
*  They just overturned all of his convictions.
*  What?
*  Well, get some of what I'm...
*  What?
*  Are you fucking kidding me?
*  I'm telling you, the prosecutors in the Harvey Weinstein case were encouraging the, whatever
*  you want to call them, right?
*  The victims.
*  The victims.
*  And yes, they are victims.
*  But she was encouraging them to just...
*  I was a juror on a murder trial, and you're instructed as a juror, this was years ago,
*  but you're instructed to only consider the facts of the case.
*  You can only discuss the facts of the case.
*  These victims were out there, and they were permitted and encouraged by a very overzealous
*  prosecutor to share things that weren't related to the case.
*  And the fact that the jury could have based their...
*  Here.
*  Here it is.
*  Wednesday's hearing ahead of Weinstein's retrial comes just over a month after the New York
*  Court of Appeals, by a four to three vote, ruled the testimony of prior bad acts, witnesses
*  allowed because it was unnecessary to establish defendants intent and served only to establish
*  defendants propensity to commit the crimes charged.
*  He was convicted in the 2020 of first degree criminal sexual assault and third degree rape,
*  and then he was sentenced to 23 years in prison.
*  He is maintained as an innocent.
*  So what are they saying now?
*  So he's got a retrial.
*  They have a retrial.
*  They're going to do a retrial.
*  Wow.
*  How old is he now?
*  Because he looked fucking terrible before he was going into jail.
*  He was walking around with a cane and a walker.
*  He's in his early 70s, but this is when directors do their best work.
*  No, truly.
*  But he's not a director.
*  Right.
*  Producers, whatever.
*  I have confidence in him is what I'm saying.
*  I think if he gets out...
*  Do you think he's going to get out and kick some ass?
*  Well, I think he gets out.
*  He's got a lot to prove.
*  Do you think they'll let him work?
*  They're not even letting Stacey work.
*  Hollywood believes in nothing.
*  They will absolutely let him work.
*  They will let him work.
*  He should work if they...
*  Listen, if the retrial happens and they let him and it doesn't work, it is what it is.
*  You know?
*  Wow.
*  Imagine if he gets out.
*  Imagine if it was all bullshit.
*  Well, I don't know how...
*  It's like...
*  It couldn't be.
*  That time that we lived through was so...
*  It was this moral panic.
*  Oh, right.
*  Right.
*  The time of...
*  You mean the time of like me too.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that happened there.
*  What does it say?
*  What originally happened, it says here he had a separate 16-year sentence that is not
*  affected by this decision in California.
*  Oh, so there's another case which he was also sentenced to.
*  So the New York trial has been...
*  So he'll be transferred to a California prison?
*  Oh, he's fucked.
*  No matter what, he's fucked.
*  Unless they do that one too.
*  Those guys, that was what they did.
*  But the crazy thing about him is he looked like that guy that would do that.
*  He looked exactly like the guy that behaved the way that he behaved.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Like Dave Chappelle had a bit about it.
*  Oh, he raped.
*  Right.
*  No, for sure.
*  You look at him like you look at a guy.
*  The other thing about him that's...
*  It's so crazy is how many photographs of famous people were with him and how many people thanked
*  him when they won the award.
*  Of course.
*  And how it was this open secret.
*  But it's just like they accepted this deal with the devil.
*  The devil's gonna make you a star if you suck his dick.
*  And apparently that's what he would do.
*  Yeah.
*  Whitney told me that there was girls that he knew, girls that she knew rather, that
*  did the deal.
*  And it was a deal.
*  Like you suck his dick, he's gonna get you in this movie.
*  And they sucked his dick and they got in the movie.
*  He would hold up his end of the bargain, which is one of the reasons why he was so powerful.
*  Because he really could...
*  He wasn't just banging everybody.
*  He really was...
*  Well, let's say this though.
*  Making people famous.
*  We think that's negative.
*  But let's say him upholding his end of the deal is something.
*  Like if he puts you in the movie.
*  I think a lot of these...
*  By the way, all of the famous people he did it to didn't really come out against him.
*  No, because they can't.
*  Because then if they tell the truth...
*  Yeah.
*  They were kind of...
*  Because that was kind of a deal that was made.
*  Not good, but that was a deal.
*  And he made good on some of those promises.
*  He made good on a lot of them, apparently.
*  This is just from what I heard.
*  Tarantino was telling us about this old school Hollywood producer who had a bedroom in his
*  office.
*  Sure.
*  So you would go into his office, and this is like in the 60s or whatever.
*  So he had his office and then he had a whole bedroom in his studio where he would bang
*  all the starlets.
*  Like if you wanted to be a star, you had to bang that guy.
*  Which is just the deal with the devil that has always been that business.
*  That's always been there.
*  That's always been there.
*  It's like why people start cults.
*  They always end up being sex cults, right?
*  100% of the time.
*  All these cults.
*  All these guys on Netflix.
*  It ends up being creepy and sexual.
*  Yep.
*  All of them.
*  That's part of it.
*  And I think if you have that kind of power and you've got a steady stream of people walking
*  in your door...
*  Yeah.
*  And you're also doing this very specific thing where you're choosing the most beautiful people
*  to be in these incredible films.
*  Right.
*  The thing about the movies that fucking guy made.
*  Kill Bill.
*  Some of the best in the world.
*  Pulp Fiction.
*  You just go down the line.
*  Let him out.
*  So many times I've seen a movie, all Miramax.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  They made insane movies.
*  They were like the Weinstein Company.
*  They were the best.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of the best.
*  And they just did it with the devil.
*  They did it with the devil.
*  Yeah.
*  They did it with the devil.
*  Like the devil's reasonable.
*  You know you watch an old Woody Allen movie and you go, I don't know if he's guilty.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  I don't want to believe he's guilty, but can I still enjoy the movie or not?
*  And then some of them, it is a little different.
*  You watch it and you go, it is.
*  I hope he's not guilty, but there's a good chance he's guilty.
*  And there's a documentary that's...
*  All of it's not good.
*  All of it's not good.
*  I mean, even if it's like your neighbor's daughter, and you've known her since she was
*  two, and then you want to marry her, that's kind of crazy.
*  It's not great.
*  You're an adult with children and your neighbor had a daughter.
*  But then again, part of your brain goes, okay, but what if you really were in love?
*  Like what if really she really was the next door neighbor and really you were 60 and she
*  was 30 and she loved you?
*  Right.
*  Or if your wife had adopted her from Cambodia.
*  That makes it more complicated.
*  And you raised her, but loved her still.
*  That's the next level.
*  That is not ideal.
*  That you can't.
*  Yeah, well say that.
*  It's not ideal.
*  You can look at the neighbor and say, well, maybe you weren't close with the neighbor's
*  daughter and now she's a grown woman.
*  She has agency.
*  She's a woman.
*  She loves you.
*  But you know what's funny about...
*  But you can't say that about a kid that you fucking raised.
*  You can't marry a kid you raised.
*  No.
*  You can't marry a kid you raised.
*  But did he raise her?
*  Did he see her like every couple days?
*  I don't know.
*  Whichever...
*  However we can still watch Annie Hall.
*  I can.
*  Is there any way to still watch Annie Hall?
*  I don't know.
*  Probably not.
*  It's hard.
*  You can, but you're going to know the whole time.
*  It's like watching House of Cards.
*  You're like, how many...
*  Yeah, but I can watch House of Cards because he's playing the guy he was.
*  That's perfect.
*  I like that Kevin Spacey doesn't even exist.
*  He's barely a person.
*  He's such a good actor.
*  He's become the thing.
*  He always plays people kind of like that.
*  Kaiser Soze, you know, Frank Underwood.
*  He's become the thing.
*  And he's so good at it that it doesn't ruin it for me.
*  I can watch House of Cards.
*  There's an arrogance that some stars had, like particularly in the 90s.
*  When I first came to Hollywood, and this is like really evident for me because I was not
*  a star, but I was on a television show.
*  So I got to be around a lot of stars.
*  And there was a way that some of them would treat you.
*  They would let you know that you are subhuman.
*  You are below them.
*  They would communicate with you in the most disrespectful and dismissive ways.
*  Like weird, fucking weird.
*  Like mousy guys that I could kill instantly.
*  And they would just be rude to you in a really weird way because they had power.
*  They had power.
*  And then when an executive would come over, they would turn on the charm.
*  They'd be smiling and laughing.
*  And then you would talk to them at the craft service and they would fucking dismiss you
*  in the shittiest ways.
*  I encountered a bunch of that.
*  It was commonplace.
*  And it was, I think, a thing that they aspire to, especially a lot of the guys that came
*  from Saturday Night Live.
*  Like when Phil came over from Saturday Night Live, Phil Hartman, when he was on news radio,
*  that was the first thing he did after Saturday Night Live.
*  And he had like his defenses up.
*  He was a little like standoffish in the beginning, kind of shitty to us.
*  He was the big star.
*  And he was.
*  And Dave Foley was a pretty big star too.
*  And the rest of us were kind of, no one really knew who we were.
*  And after a while he'd relax and he would tell me about it.
*  And he was like, you know, it's great here.
*  We all have fun.
*  But God, on Saturday Night Live, everybody was stabbing everybody in the back.
*  People were getting people fired that were like his assistants just because they wanted
*  to fuck him over.
*  They would steal people's things.
*  And it was just like really shitty.
*  And it took a while for him to chill out.
*  And then I got to meet some of those people that he was talking about and interact with
*  them and they did the same thing to me.
*  Yeah, there was some shitty fucking people out of that.
*  This is this this star culture.
*  And they would be the ones that were the royalty and everyone else was a peasant.
*  It was really fucking creepy.
*  Interesting.
*  So I think if you're like an old school dick grabber and you're also a Hollywood icon,
*  you know, you probably are doing that.
*  You're probably doing that Hollywood thing where everybody else is just there for you.
*  Everybody else is just.
*  Should we maybe wall off Hollywood and just go listen, let them go wild.
*  They're just all sexual predators like Jurassic Park.
*  It's Jurassic Park.
*  Can we do that?
*  Can we say enter at your own risk?
*  They make great movies, but occasionally they're going to goose you.
*  They may throw you against a wall.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if you train for the Navy SEALs, some people drown.
*  Can't we just do that?
*  Because the other way is it working where everyone's nice and good.
*  Everyone can't be nice and good and have really good art.
*  I don't think I'm not saying everyone has to be killing everyone.
*  Ron Howard seems to be really nice and good.
*  But I watched the Spacey documentary, by the way, and some of it is like, okay, he's clearly
*  did the wrong thing.
*  And then some of it, these guys are like, because they wanted things from him, they're
*  like, we went to the movies and he started jerking off next to me.
*  It's like, okay, dude, well, then you know, this is not a guy to hang with.
*  And then the next thing they say is, and then he invited me to a party at his hotel and
*  he said Bruce Willis would be there.
*  So I went.
*  And you go, well, we can't feel bad for you because you're trying to climb on the basis
*  of knowing this guy.
*  You are playing the game.
*  That's right.
*  You're playing the game.
*  You're playing the game.
*  You're dancing with the devil.
*  You're going to lunch with Harvey.
*  You're going to lunch with Harvey.
*  You want it.
*  You know, so to me, it's like they're not sympathetic in the way that like, you know,
*  people are, whether it's sexual assault in the military or in the workplace or whatever,
*  where people are not actively trying to better their chances of being famous by knowing this
*  guy.
*  Right.
*  It's, it's a complicated thing with Spacey, right?
*  Because apparently some of the alleged people are like people that he worked like, you know,
*  like a grip on a set or a guy who has to drive them to, you know, he was just wild, apparently.
*  This is allegedly.
*  Right.
*  And then some of those people died before they could testify.
*  Do you think you could play a guy like Frank Underwood if there's not a little bit of that
*  inside of you somewhere?
*  No, probably not.
*  Probably not.
*  You know, you know, he had a really rough life.
*  Did he?
*  And you know, his brother, his father was a Nazi pedophile.
*  Oh my God.
*  This is true.
*  Oh my God.
*  And his father was all of Twitter, but no, he was a Nazi.
*  He would, he would rape them and make them watch the Nazi stuff.
*  This is, I know I sound like I'm lying a lot and I am a lot, but this is true.
*  You can look this up.
*  Oh God.
*  His brother is a Rod Stewart impersonator.
*  Oh God.
*  It wasn't great the way that it went for anybody over there.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  According to Kevin Spacey, he was raised by a relentlessly abusive neo-Nazi father.
*  Wow.
*  Spent his dinners making anti-Semitic comments, which terrified his children.
*  Wow.
*  Yes.
*  And worse than beating and raping them, he was anti-Semitic.
*  Wow.
*  So he was really bad.
*  Does that say that in here?
*  The raping part?
*  I believe, from what I know.
*  That's his brother?
*  The Rod Stewart impression?
*  That he was a very abusive.
*  Damn, his brother has fucking got it nailed.
*  The brother is really dialed.
*  Boy, if I saw that dude in the fucking.
*  Yeah, no.
*  He's dialed.
*  Yeah.
*  If I was like somewhere, I'd be like, holy shit, Rod Stewart.
*  Look at this.
*  He alleges his father frequently raped and beat him.
*  I mean, I'm not making it up.
*  It's terrible.
*  Oh my God.
*  Frequently raped and beat him.
*  Oh, why didn't they put that in the title?
*  Like, just the anti-Semitic comments, that seems like the least of the problem.
*  For the way they grew up, let's be charitable.
*  They turned out good.
*  Right.
*  They turned out well.
*  They got one multiple Academy Awards.
*  He's a very talented man and his brother, I'm sure, does a great Maggie Mae.
*  Yeah.
*  For the way they were raised.
*  Everybody has to be judged a little bit with a backstory.
*  I love that Lex Friedman has the courage to interview anybody.
*  Well, Lex is one of those guys who genuinely is like, you know, he knows what his intentions
*  are and he's very comfortable with himself and that's why he can talk to all these people.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he's always coming from a good place.
*  Even Kanye in the heat of everything, Lex had him on.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Bill Maher did all episodes and said, I'm not releasing it.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  I can't wait.
*  Kanye, Spacey, can we do an election?
*  Because there's going to be an election.
*  I'm angling to get back in here with Kanye and Spacey and Weinstein from jail.
*  I would get you in here with Kanye, but it would probably turn bad because you talk too
*  much.
*  I know.
*  With Kanye, you got to let him talk.
*  I know.
*  Because like there was moments where I was talking.
*  I let him talk.
*  There was moments where I was talking, Kanye was like.
*  He has so much to say.
*  I mean, listen, that madness inside of him is why his fucking songs are bangers.
*  They're just banger after banger.
*  His fucking new album is amazing.
*  It's amazing, dude.
*  We play in the green room all the time.
*  In all my Spotify playlist, I think there's more Kanye songs than anything.
*  He's a genius.
*  And what you have to realize with people that are incredibly gifted is a lot of that comes
*  with some real downsides.
*  Yeah.
*  And they can't be judged maybe the same way you judge every other person.
*  Well, I mean, they got to follow the laws.
*  You can't be out there murdering people.
*  You can't do that.
*  They got to follow the laws.
*  But if he goes says something crazy, it's also like a, you know, you got to look at
*  like what you've gotten from him and all of this great music.
*  Let him have a tirade every now and then.
*  Let him have a little.
*  Well, it's like he's his own enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like he can't, the rants just go.
*  I know.
*  He's come flying out and who knows how much of it he's really been committed to until
*  he says it.
*  And then once he's saying it, then he's really committed.
*  You know, and then, you know, he puts he shows up statistics like he held up this thing about
*  it was showing on his phone all of the different people that are running all the different
*  music companies and how many of them are Jewish.
*  Right.
*  You know, he's like they run they run the media.
*  They run this.
*  They run that like, OK.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, what are you going to say about that?
*  If they are facts, if these people are all Jewish.
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing something evil.
*  Just, you know, if you buy pizza, a lot of the people selling it are Italian.
*  I will say that the Jews seem to have made better choices than the Irish.
*  My people.
*  Well, they're really good at running show business.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't point to any list of people and go and they're and they're all I is not one group
*  and go and look and McDonough and O'Brien.
*  Right. Right.
*  Like Italians, like my people.
*  What are what other than food?
*  Someone said a teacher I had in community college, you take it with a grain of salt,
*  but said that Italians were very focused on the family and they were skeptical of institutions.
*  So they started small businesses, whereas Jewish people were more open to institutions.
*  And that's why a lot of them are overrepresented in academia, politics and media.
*  Well, Italians are fleeing communism, too.
*  Right.
*  So Italians are skeptical of the government.
*  They were skeptical and they wanted to have their little pork stores and stuff.
*  And that's cool.
*  And it's also Catholic, very family oriented.
*  Catholic.
*  You know, if you date an Italian girl, you got to meet everybody.
*  That's right.
*  You can't be just showing up at her house like some regular white guy.
*  And the Irish were were drunks and sexually abused.
*  A little bit.
*  And they did the best they could.
*  They did the best they could.
*  They did the best they could.
*  They made good boxers.
*  Everyone's doing the best they can.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we're all coming out of chaos.
*  The reality of human beings in this country is this fucking country is three peoples old.
*  Right.
*  Three people.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Three people.
*  You know, that's the reality of this country.
*  China is 400 people old.
*  Right.
*  You know, that's real.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the difference.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like we don't have our shit together yet.
*  And we started off with a really good idea that didn't anticipate technology.
*  And then technology got involved in terms of like stock trading and then influences
*  of campaigns.
*  Nobody anticipated the lobbyists, special interest groups.
*  Nobody anticipated the military industrial complex until Eisenhower talked about it on
*  TV.
*  Just all these things got in the way of the original idea that they just they had a great
*  fucking idea of how to make sure that no one ever becomes a dictator and that the will
*  of the people get served.
*  They had a great idea.
*  And now they have an idea where everyone can kind of be a dictator.
*  So that's not the worst idea.
*  You can be a little dictator.
*  Well, what they really didn't anticipate is the power that technology companies have.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's what they own.
*  Your thoughts, dreams, hopes, fears.
*  They have burrowed into your life more than any of the robber barons could more than any
*  of those guys.
*  Morgan or Rockefeller, Carnegie, they've gotten insanely wealthy just from your data.
*  Absolutely.
*  And then convincing you, you have to buy a new phone every week.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're helping you.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the scary part, right?
*  They're utopians and they believe they're creating a truly better world and helping
*  you.
*  They make your life better and they make your life better.
*  And you do.
*  And these are things that make your life more convenient and easier.
*  How great is Google Maps or Waze?
*  So when they tell you it's more convenient to just not have this discussion or not have
*  be able to say a certain term or not be able to then you you know, you just comply, comply
*  and you go, OK, I don't want to start any trouble.
*  I don't want to start an issue.
*  I like Postmates.
*  Yeah.
*  Or whatever it is.
*  I like Airbnb.
*  Well, sure.
*  What's failing now?
*  It's over now.
*  It's all over now.
*  I met one of the guys.
*  Well, someone I don't know if it was you, but someone said and this is really nice.
*  Someone tried to get me back and they were like, no, someone met a big guy and it might
*  have been you.
*  Someone was like, I think it was me.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody was like, what about getting like a guy like Tim Dillon back on?
*  And they were like, no, they're fucking up.
*  They're making a big mistake.
*  Well, that issue that I had was all about the redundancy of cleaning fees.
*  Why would I pay a fee and then clean?
*  This has now become a rallying call for millions of brave Americans to hold Airbnb accountable
*  for what they've been doing.
*  Forget the trafficking.
*  People show up to the house in the middle of night trying to rip you out of it.
*  This is true.
*  Single women go on bachelor parties all the time.
*  Guys knock on the door at 3 a.m.
*  It's not safe.
*  A lot of the people who host like have Airbnbs have weird cameras set up.
*  Yeah, there's been a bunch of that.
*  It is strange.
*  There's also someone who had an interesting scam where they were renting a house and they
*  were using that house as an Airbnb house.
*  Of course.
*  They're probably making money off of the rental.
*  You think about how much a house costs to rent if it's like two thousand bucks a month
*  and you could Airbnb it for five hundred bucks a night.
*  What's Airbnb cost for a house?
*  It's been years.
*  It's about four hundred.
*  You would probably make a lot of money.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  You pay your mortgage easy and then you can do that with multiple houses.
*  You get income constantly coming in.
*  I think they interviewed the CEO recently.
*  They interviewed him and he was basically like, listen, we're trying to design your
*  trips.
*  They're trying to figure out ways to get competitive again because they're like, we know people
*  are going back to hotels.
*  We know it's gotten too expensive.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yeah, it's gotten too expensive.
*  We don't understand why we'd pay all of this money to have all of these rules when we could
*  just go to a hotel.
*  It's easy.
*  Right.
*  And we don't have to worry about you get a report card.
*  Airbnb is a report card.
*  Nobody wants that on a trip.
*  You get a report card for like how good you did or bad.
*  People writing reviews about you.
*  Is that fun?
*  You go on a vacation.
*  Somebody's going to write a review.
*  Some psychopath.
*  So like you could like take a giant shit and forget to flush it and then it's over.
*  Then they trash just a simple mistake.
*  A simple mistake.
*  And stay out of people's homes.
*  This is the real reality.
*  Stay out of people.
*  If you're over 30, you can no longer stay with people.
*  Put it this way.
*  Let's give them till 35 or 40.
*  You have to get a hotel.
*  Yeah, you can't get a hotel.
*  You cannot stay with a with a friend and you don't need to get an Airbnb with seven people.
*  Yeah, I always get weirded out when people like to just stay with different friends in
*  every town.
*  No, no.
*  Do you like being annoying?
*  Yeah, that's done now.
*  You can't stay with anyone anymore.
*  You go to a hotel.
*  That's nice.
*  Like an adult.
*  It's like an adult.
*  You go, this was nice.
*  Goodbye.
*  You need to say the word goodbye and then you got to go to a hotel.
*  Otherwise people are like they feel uncomfortable in their own home.
*  They do not want you there.
*  It's kind of crazy that Airbnb.
*  That's another thing that popped up out of nowhere that nobody saw coming.
*  That was a disruptor.
*  Not an Uber, right?
*  Uber was a big one.
*  Popped up.
*  But no one would have thought that everybody would become a cab driver for extra money.
*  Well, it coincided with like this with this rise of the gig economy where people are like,
*  I'll just be I can work.
*  I own a car.
*  I can work and I can make money through this app and you can not have a boss boss.
*  Exactly.
*  Like one of the things I loved about delivering newspapers when I was a kid was, you know,
*  I did it when I was in my teens and 20s.
*  It's like you could just go to the place, pick up the paper.
*  You did your work, but you could listen to the radio.
*  No one's in your ear.
*  No one's talking to you.
*  You're by yourself.
*  As long as you get your job done, you're good.
*  And if you're an Uber guy, you don't have you don't just like I don't have to go to
*  a fucking office somewhere.
*  I just pick this dude up and take him to the airport.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for the tip.
*  Bye.
*  Drive away.
*  Be a nice guy.
*  You know, try to keep your car clean.
*  That's right.
*  You can make money and you don't have to listen to anybody.
*  And they're having fun.
*  You guys are having fun all day listening to hateful podcasts.
*  Perhaps mine.
*  This list and smoking cigs in their car right now.
*  Yeah.
*  People listening to it right now going, I'm enjoying my life.
*  I'm having fun somewhere.
*  There's someone in the backseat going fucking Tim Dillon.
*  Shut.
*  Shut.
*  I hate his voice.
*  What he did to Meghan McCain was so rude.
*  What he did to all of these people, all of these innocent people, innocent, so fucking
*  rude, innocent, good billionaire.
*  Speaking of innocent, did you see Fauci?
*  Did you see the way he came out?
*  Did you see the the leaked tapes?
*  Not just the leaked tapes, but him getting grilled in Congress.
*  Oh, I didn't see it.
*  Oh my God.
*  Was it bad?
*  Was it brutal?
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Jim Jordan got him lying under oath.
*  They he's just no matter what they catch him with, he tries to find a way to weasel out
*  of saying that he said that, including saying mandating masks, shutting down schools, locking
*  everything down, closing businesses, forcing people to get the vaccine.
*  All of it is on tape.
*  He said all of it.
*  It seems to be again, it's the gaslighting thing where people go.
*  We can just now come out and say that we never actually said any of that.
*  It's crazy him saying that, though, not just saying that, but even when they catch him
*  saying that, that's not what I was referring to.
*  Right.
*  But that's exactly what you were referring to.
*  There's no there's no ambiguity at all about any of the things you're saying.
*  And then also the gain of function research.
*  They deleted a bunch of emails.
*  There's all these emails from his assistant talking about how to go in separate channels
*  to talk about this stuff and how to skirt around the Freedom of Information Act.
*  Right.
*  And then fucking Peter Hotez talking about deleting emails.
*  Yeah.
*  They all knew what the fuck they were doing, man.
*  They were they were all very aware that they were going to be investigated eventually.
*  There should be a commission on this whole thing.
*  But just like the 9-11 commission would probably be set up to fail.
*  And that's what the commissioner said.
*  That's not what I'm saying.
*  Even if Trump gets into office, how could it be?
*  Because he he was the guy.
*  Right.
*  He was the guy who had the top speed in place.
*  That's right.
*  He thought she was behind him at press conferences.
*  I think that's his biggest vulnerability.
*  Ironically, Trump is that a lot of people don't trust him because of that period.
*  Well he hasn't.
*  The vaccine.
*  He hasn't corrected course.
*  Right.
*  Because it's very difficult for him to ever say that he's wrong.
*  Right.
*  He doesn't like saying he's wrong.
*  So for him to correct course, for him to look at the studies that are coming out of the
*  about excess deaths and where they're a little bit more honest about what the fuck is going
*  on because they have socialized medicine.
*  Right.
*  Like there's a lot more going on over there than it's going on over here.
*  There's so much about protecting pharma here.
*  Yeah.
*  So much money.
*  Right.
*  I mean so much money invested in advertising.
*  I mean everything gets advertised by it, whether it's internet shows.
*  There's fucking so many television shows.
*  I mean that montage, I'm sure you've seen it, brought to you by Pfizer.
*  Right.
*  The CNN one.
*  That's fucking nuts, man.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's nuts.
*  There's so much money involved in this that these people just keep their fucking mouth
*  shut because the people that are, these people aren't real journalists on television.
*  No.
*  You see that when Chris Cuomo has to debate Dave Smith.
*  Right.
*  What they are is mouthpieces for whatever the fuck is the network.
*  They're actors.
*  Yeah.
*  They're doing what they're, and they think they're journalists, which is hilarious.
*  When you see, when Elon Musk sat down with Don Lemon, and you realize, and like, Don
*  said it, or Elon said it best, rather, he said Don is doing CNN outside of CNN.
*  That's what he thinks talking to people is.
*  Yeah.
*  No, they're actors, they're showpieces, and they're mouthpieces for usually corporate
*  America and quite often whatever party makes corporate America feel cozy at the moment.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a bizarre, bizarre merging of commerce and the news.
*  Yeah.
*  That should have never, that's another thing no one saw coming, right?
*  The Founding Fathers, they never saw that level of propaganda being possible that you
*  would have funded propaganda that was working step by step with the government.
*  It's gotten to be, but you know what?
*  It's watching it fall apart over the last few years has been really interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it is falling apart.
*  Oh, well it has to.
*  You are watching these guys and you go, they are convincing nobody.
*  I mean, I'm sure they're still convincing some people, but most free thinking people,
*  most people that don't have an investment in it are looking at it, it feels fake.
*  Yeah.
*  It all feels fake.
*  I think people are starting to question it more than they ever have.
*  I don't think the government will ever fully recover from the pandemic in terms of trust
*  levels with all those kids who had to do proms in a car or wear masks jogging on a track.
*  I don't think those kids ever look at the government the same way and that's probably
*  good.
*  It's good.
*  I think that's good.
*  It's good and the thing is young kids are paying attention to what is going on now in
*  a way that they know that it's going to affect their life.
*  They pay attention to the government like these fucking idiots, they're going to affect
*  my life because they affected their life.
*  That's right.
*  They pay attention to their parents, like how many of these young kids saw parents lose
*  jobs, saw divorces happen, suicides in the family, breakups, drug addiction, so many
*  fucking things happen that didn't have to happen that were brought on because of the
*  lockdowns and because of the pandemic and the government's mandating things.
*  How many people did they know that got health problems because of the vaccine?
*  How many people did they know died young?
*  Everybody knows something.
*  No, and I think they're more likely now to have a skeptical view of the government.
*  Which is good.
*  And I think they understand more probably the value of, now I don't know if they're
*  going to understand this in every area, but what propaganda is, how it kind of functions
*  and how to be aware and cognizant of the fact that there are people that are shaping and
*  sculpting the narrative and shoving it down your throat.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's more people now questioning things, especially young kids, are questioning
*  stuff about the war machine and the war economy more than they ever have before and going
*  like, what is, why are we involved here and why are we funding this and why are we doing
*  that?
*  And I think people are, and that doesn't mean they're sloppy, obviously, they're not getting
*  everything right, but they're out there.
*  They're also being heavily manipulated, which is something that's been discussed with a
*  bunch of people on the show.
*  We talked about, with Gadsad in particular, who is behind all these protests at the universities?
*  They're organized.
*  And they're organized a lot by Soros-funded groups and a bunch of different groups that
*  they organize these things to get a narrative very popular.
*  And the whole thing is just disruptive.
*  That's the key.
*  The key is to get people upset, to keep people disrupted and to further erode our idea that
*  we have any kind of control whatsoever about what goes on.
*  I went to one of those protests at UCLA.
*  It was fun.
*  It's young people.
*  They're trying to enjoy themselves.
*  Is that what it was?
*  It kind of felt like that.
*  Like a little festive?
*  It didn't feel like Hamas had taken over the college.
*  I know that it felt like there were people there that were clearly probably pro-Hamas,
*  as whatever you want to call them, as a group.
*  But then it felt like there was a lot of kids there that just saw what was going on in Gaza
*  and they were like, we are against America funding that.
*  And they went out to do that and they wanted to, in the best way that they knew how express,
*  how upset they were.
*  Now, you can't destroy property.
*  You can't commandeer areas.
*  These are all areas where in a civil society you can't do those things.
*  But I think a lot of the people, their reaction to a lot of what was going on was probably
*  heavily manipulated, but some of it was organic.
*  Some of them were seeing it on TikTok going like, we're seeing kids being killed and we're
*  paying for it and we should do something.
*  The more people I spoke to, I was like, yeah, I didn't think that they were, I thought probably
*  a lot of them were a little naive about certain things, but they're in college.
*  So that's okay.
*  Everybody's naive in college.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's a thing to be a good person.
*  You want to go out and support the good thing.
*  What's the good thing?
*  Free Palestine.
*  Yes.
*  From the river to the sea.
*  Which river, which sea?
*  No one knows.
*  Who cares?
*  That's not what's important.
*  What's important is I'm out here because Debbie's really progressive and she's hot.
*  Want some coffee?
*  Yeah, please.
*  Debbie's really progressive and she's hot and I'm trying to impress her.
*  And listen, I enjoyed it.
*  It seemed fun.
*  I took a few selfies with them.
*  They were good people.
*  And then they were like the cops.
*  You got recognized.
*  Yeah, a few times.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the kids were like, you had Abbey Martin on.
*  And I was like, thank you, you know, whatever.
*  Thank you.
*  And they were very nice.
*  And then they were like, well, the cops are coming in.
*  They think they're coming in with rubber bullets and hoses and everything.
*  And I said, I got to at the Beverly Hills Hotel, you have to put your breakfast order
*  on the door by 1 a.m.
*  And I explained that to the kids.
*  And they'll know to bring the egg and everything.
*  I said, I can't be here during the onslaught of the police activity.
*  But you guys should.
*  I even said that.
*  I go, you guys should and lock arms.
*  Do that stuff because you only live once and you're only a kid once and make these cops
*  work.
*  Who cares?
*  Lock arms.
*  But I had to go.
*  I can't be.
*  Did you see what happened in Philly when the gay pride parade met Free Palestine and they
*  was a flash?
*  Yeah, it was a clash.
*  They clashed.
*  Kurt Metzger would call that the great Kurt Metzger would call that, I believe, an intersectional
*  car crash.
*  It was funny.
*  They were saying you can't march because Palestine is not free.
*  You got to stop right here.
*  Yeah, we're more important.
*  This is more important.
*  It was weird watching it because they were like, there's no joy.
*  No one should be happy.
*  I think pride is very silly.
*  There's a whole month that's very silly.
*  If you look at what was done to black people and you look at what was done to gay people,
*  it's insane that pride is a full month.
*  A couple of weekends, maybe one or two.
*  The idea that it's a full month is nuts.
*  How about there's only Veterans Day?
*  Right.
*  There's one day for veterans and there's an entire month.
*  There's Veterans Day and Memorial Day.
*  What the month of pride allows people to do is it allows corporations to just talk about
*  how down they are with fisting.
*  That's really all it is.
*  It's just Capital One going, it's like we will, you can, and I say that as an out gay
*  guy who has no problem with people going to pride parades and having fun.
*  I don't think nine-year-olds should be there.
*  How old do you think is the cutoff?
*  When your kids are in their teens, perhaps, if they're in their older teens, I just think
*  kids should be-
*  Legal teens, you mean?
*  No, I don't think a 13-year-old needs to be there either.
*  17?
*  17 is fine.
*  17 and no, he's gay.
*  Or they could just 17 and they're mature enough to handle what's going on.
*  Are they though?
*  I don't know, but it depends.
*  I'm not mature enough to handle what's going on in the pride parades.
*  The pride parades have gone off the chain.
*  They've gone off the chain.
*  People dressing up like dogs and stuff is crazy.
*  Congressman.
*  To me, I've always felt that if you're going to go out and have a party where people are
*  getting drunk and hooking up and dancing, anybody who's legally underage shouldn't
*  be there.
*  17 is right on the cusp and then 18 and everything is fine.
*  To me, I don't think it belongs for kids.
*  That's clearly it doesn't belong for kids.
*  People want to do it to show their kids tolerance and acceptance.
*  You don't have to.
*  That's not-
*  That's why I have to do it.
*  It's very sexualized.
*  It's very sexualized.
*  The thing about pride is, yeah, sure, you should celebrate the fact that gays are free
*  to get married and they have all the same rights as everybody else, as they should.
*  It's sexual.
*  It's like a lot of guys with thongs on.
*  It's like Spring Break.
*  Yeah, it's wild.
*  It's like, would you take your 10-year-old to Spring Break to teach them tolerance?
*  No.
*  You wouldn't do that.
*  That's kind of straight pride.
*  Spring Break is a bunch of people going to get fucked up in Florida and they're going
*  to fight each other and have sex.
*  You wouldn't take your young children to see that.
*  I don't see the reason to take your kids to a highly sexualized parade.
*  You want to take them to an event that's not as sexualized?
*  Maybe a mother would tell her kids, your father's getting an award.
*  He's gay.
*  He's getting an award.
*  That's why it didn't work out with us.
*  Your father's gay.
*  He's a faggot and we're watching him get an award tonight because he wrote a book.
*  Poor bastards are out there in marriages right now.
*  Probably a lot.
*  There's probably a lot of them.
*  Just trapped.
*  Just can't be themselves.
*  But you know what it is?
*  Nothing's great.
*  You probably have a fine wife.
*  Nothing's great.
*  Listen, continue to do things on the DL.
*  Just don't give her AIDS.
*  This is not a popular thing to say.
*  During Pride.
*  There's so many political attachments to being gay now.
*  If you're a closeted guy, just fuck your wife once a month.
*  Cheat on her.
*  Don't give her AIDS.
*  And just keep the family tight.
*  And I know that that's probably not popular.
*  But now it's not that.
*  If you're 60, are you going to come out?
*  Do we really need people coming out in their 70s?
*  Do we need this?
*  To be very honest.
*  There's a window of which you can get honest.
*  If you don't, double down on the lie.
*  I think that's a great strategy for all of life.
*  I think there's a window to be honest.
*  It's not forever.
*  Nobody wants somebody coming out in their 50s, 60s.
*  It's enough already.
*  On their deathbed.
*  Yeah, it's on their deathbed.
*  Oh, so now you've lied the whole time.
*  Right.
*  Just keep it a secret.
*  Just keep it a secret.
*  Not a bad piece of advice.
*  It's not a bad piece of advice.
*  Happy pride.
*  But it is.
*  I do feel that way.
*  I think that like some people.
*  Some people probably can't handle a change.
*  Some big shift.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Yeah, it's a big shift.
*  You know, I mean, it's also weird now because people it's like, what are you coming out
*  as if you just you want to have sex with dudes, you want to have sex with women.
*  And then you're like, okay, so then, okay, I'm gay or lesbian.
*  But then you're like, what is LGBTQIA2 thing?
*  What are you?
*  What is that flag?
*  You'd be a two spirit.
*  Two spirit.
*  That's what two is.
*  The fact that we allow that is hilarious.
*  No, no, it's amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  And A. I like how A's in there.
*  You're asexual.
*  You don't have a fucking dog in this race.
*  So you go, okay, so I have this and then I have a flag.
*  I don't understand.
*  Nobody understands the flag.
*  It keeps getting bigger.
*  Indigenous.
*  It keeps changing.
*  What a white gay people.
*  And I'm not saying indigenous people don't have issues, but what a white gay people have
*  anything to do with the indigenous community.
*  They're just trying to develop a gang.
*  Yeah, it's right.
*  It's like, why would they pretend to understand like what indigenous people go through?
*  How did the eye get in there?
*  It used to be we were making fun of putting the trans people and the lesbians in with
*  the gays.
*  Yes.
*  Which is a very different thing.
*  Well, lesbians are going away.
*  Barry Weiss and Ibea is the final lesbian.
*  Did you know that?
*  No.
*  She's the final one.
*  That's it.
*  The final countdown.
*  That's it.
*  Barry Weiss.
*  And do you know in Israel, they canceled the Pride parade this year?
*  Why?
*  Because their gay pride flag, they made the yellow, I think, bigger because of the hostages.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So they didn't they would not have a gay pride parade.
*  And they're also using all the material that they would have used in the pride parade to
*  carpet bomb civilian areas of Rafa.
*  But here's the point.
*  All of the fireworks and stuff are directly being shot at babies faces who are homophobic
*  and should go.
*  Because by the way, you know, that's the whole thing they're doing over there.
*  Where they go, they go if like they just bombed a school and the Israel's got to stop doing
*  this all the time.
*  Every now and when I grew up, Israel bombed school every now and then.
*  And people would go, oh, it was not all the time.
*  Now they're doing it too much.
*  And it's making people upset.
*  When I grew up, it was a nice thing every now and then.
*  Never nice thing.
*  But every now and then it would be like you wouldn't know what Israel is doing.
*  Israel just bombed a school and you go, oh, it was rare.
*  Now they're doing it so much.
*  And if you go, this might be a lot and I support them and their right to exist.
*  But this seems to be every human rights organization in the world, every country, everybody's going,
*  this is guys, please, even America, even Biden, even Biden is going, guys, please.
*  And the response to maybe let's not bomb these refugee camps is, do you know what Hamas does
*  to gay people and women?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, guys, come on.
*  Yeah, that's not.
*  But you're killing people.
*  You're killing children.
*  Yeah.
*  And women.
*  And women.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot.
*  A lot.
*  We got to figure out a way.
*  More than you're killing terrorists.
*  Yeah.
*  We got to figure out a way to make this a better situation.
*  That's another one that's so wild too, because the left has always been kind of clear on where
*  it would look at conflicts.
*  With Ukraine, the left is all in for Ukraine.
*  Right?
*  There's people on the right that are in for Ukraine, but the left is pretty much all in.
*  They're all in.
*  Putin's bad.
*  The far left isn't, but the mainstream left that we all know about is.
*  But with Israel, you have people on the left that are pro-Israel.
*  A lot.
*  Hardcore.
*  Hardcore.
*  Who just will find a way to rationalize the human shield argument, no matter what it is.
*  And no one is being straight up about it.
*  No one's being ideological about it.
*  No one is saying the whole thing is chaos.
*  No one is saying, no one's talking about the history of the region, like the real history
*  of the region, which is really complex.
*  It's very complex.
*  It goes back forever.
*  And then no one is looking at this like there's any kind of fucking solution that makes any
*  sense.
*  No.
*  So you're either ideal, so there's no clear path, like this guy's dead on and this is
*  the way we have to treat this and this has to be handled.
*  No, it's either Hamas is using human shields and Israel has a right to exist and they want
*  to wipe Israel out and if Israel laid down their arms, they would slaughter them.
*  If Hamas laid down their arms, they would be fined.
*  Like, fuck man.
*  It's hard.
*  And it's like there's definitely, I think, naivete on both sides.
*  The people that think Hamas is like a high school theater group are insane.
*  But the people also that think that you can bomb your way to the peace over there, I don't
*  know.
*  Yeah, you're not going to do that.
*  You're not going to do it.
*  What are they going to do with all those people that survive?
*  I mean, imagine how many future Hamas people they've created.
*  They're going to build hotels in Gaza.
*  They're going to turn it into a, because I think that's maybe the end game is to like
*  eventually put a bunch of money into it.
*  That's perhaps the end game.
*  Well, it is expensive real estate.
*  It's real estate by the sea.
*  They're going to put hotels in it and then white people, you know, white chicks from
*  America are going to go to trips.
*  Well whenever there's like land that something happens to that's close to water, people are
*  like hang on, hang on before making decisions.
*  You know, this area of Maui is really valuable.
*  We can do wild things here.
*  If we can figure out a way to appropriate it, if we just hang on long enough for all these
*  people lose their mortgages and we just like figure out a slow down construction, slow
*  down rebuilding.
*  They're going to hire.
*  I mean, look, it's a terrible tragedy that this happened, but look, we can't go back
*  in time.
*  What are we going to do?
*  I mean, what are you going to do?
*  What are these people going to rebuild?
*  They're going to hire the people that are left to work at the hotels that the people
*  who bombed them are going to visit.
*  That is exactly what is going to happen.
*  And there's going to be a woman, there's going to be a kid who goes, here's your eggs, bad
*  addiction.
*  She's going to go, hi, are you are you from here?
*  And he's going to go, yes.
*  And she's going to go, does your family still live here?
*  And he's going to go, no.
*  And she's going to go, why do they move?
*  And he's going to go, they were killed in the war.
*  And she's going to go, oh, anyway, can we have some ice lattes too?
*  Like that's that's what's going to happen.
*  That's my guess.
*  I guess.
*  Do you think that there's any?
*  Is there a way that they could sell Israel taking over Gaza?
*  Is there a way they could actually sell that?
*  Yes.
*  The way you sell everything is by saying humanitarian reasons and you're going to pump in a lot
*  of money and you're going to make things a lot better.
*  I don't know.
*  The last administration that truly tried to get a Palestinian state, people talk about
*  Clinton, but it was really H.W. Bush.
*  George H.W. Bush tried to curb a lot of the settlement building and try to say, listen,
*  we need to come to the table and have a Palestinian state.
*  There was another attempt during Clinton.
*  It didn't work for various reasons.
*  People can argue about why.
*  It does feel like no one's talked about it recently.
*  And it's just kind of been a thing that everybody ignored.
*  So the idea that it won't exist is more likely now, I think, than it was.
*  I mean, and it should exist.
*  People should have the right to have a home.
*  But I feel like they would sell it in the sense that in order to provide economic and
*  security guarantees, it has to be an occupied region forever.
*  I think that and then the idea is like, I mean, listen, they're preparing.
*  Look at Military Times just wrote an editorial.
*  They want to bring back the draft.
*  They want to bring it back in Germany.
*  They're all preparing for something.
*  There is a very big push right now to militarize certain areas of the world, to bring back
*  the draft, to, you know, see this as a Cold War that could turn hot.
*  Biden basically said to the Ukraine, use American weapons in Russia.
*  You can use American weapons for cross, but not in a defensive capacity, for cross border
*  attacks into Russia.
*  Russia is now doing war games in the Caribbean.
*  You know, we are ratcheting all of this stuff up at a time when it is we should be completely
*  going the other way.
*  We should be trying to figure out how to live on the planet with China, and we should not
*  be getting involved in a we should not be encouraging countries to join NATO to antagonize
*  Russia and getting involved in proxy wars.
*  That's crazy.
*  Is he going to pull out of NATO?
*  He said that.
*  He also said he would have bought, you know, the fundraiser the other day, he said he would
*  have bombed Russia and China like what he's very bellicose.
*  Yes, he said you can look at.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So he's saying all kinds of wild stuff now.
*  I don't think he would have, but I think it might also help to be that bellicose and say
*  all those wild things.
*  Saying that you would bomb China and Russia.
*  He said at a fundraiser recently and the people in the fundraiser were kind of shocked.
*  He was basically like, yeah, we would have hit him and, you know, we would have done
*  Yeah, he's he's been, you know, I got to see this.
*  No, he's right here.
*  Trump at fundraisers says we would have bombed Russia and China.
*  What?
*  What?
*  What did he say?
*  Where did it say?
*  What the fuck did he say?
*  I believe that President Trump will be supportive of Taiwan when he becomes president.
*  He's there the first term.
*  So where does it say that he would bomb?
*  What does it say here?
*  During a rally in Bronx, reference several authoritarian leaders, including Vladimir
*  Putin, saying they were at the top of their game, whether you like it or not, the world
*  is going to respect us again if he's reelected, he claims.
*  The bomb revelation was made in a Washington Post report on Trump's recent fundraising
*  tour during which he tested the boundaries of federal campaign finance laws, according
*  to experts at a fundraiser in New York earlier this month.
*  Mr. Trump told the attendees he wanted to hear what they had on their minds, hearing
*  options from on former UN ambassador and his final Republican primary opponent, Nikki
*  Haley, and several issues connected to Israel.
*  Mr. Trump is routinely.
*  What is it? Where does it say about the bomb thing?
*  Where does it say that? I don't see any of this.
*  You should that should be like front and center if it's in the headline.
*  No, for sure. Like why you make me go all the where does it say bomb them?
*  In quotes right here, it says the bomb revelation was made.
*  But right. But what does that mean?
*  Amongst the people talking.
*  Yeah. What does that mean?
*  Like they're not saying his quote.
*  That's a real sneaky thing to do.
*  Yeah. The bomb revelation was made in a Washington Post report on Trump's recent
*  fundraising tour. But what was it?
*  Find a different article on it.
*  Yeah. See if they have a quote.
*  Yeah, that seems Trump would bomb Moscow.
*  Allegedly said he would.
*  Allegedly. Right.
*  Allegedly. Well, he says a lot of stuff.
*  He might not have said this, but that's a crazy Yahoo title.
*  Right. Trump suggested at fundraiser he would have bombed.
*  Like that seems to me like unless you have the fucking quote,
*  you shouldn't be saying that.
*  It is kind of funny.
*  Don't turn out crazy Putin.
*  That's a great headline.
*  Oh, my God. The Hill said that.
*  But this doesn't say he was going to bomb it.
*  It says, according to the Kiev independent, which is what Yahoo reposted,
*  the formerly and possibly future president.
*  Let me say this in what Trump said a few days before, according to the Kiev
*  independence retelling of a May 28 story in the Washington Post,
*  the former and possibly future president suggested at a fundraising event
*  that he would have bombed Moscow in response to Russia, full scale invasion
*  of Ukraine. But this is not saying his his actual quote.
*  He also said in quotes he would attack Beijing if China invaded Taiwan on his watch.
*  But is that it's got an asterisk?
*  Is that no, it's quote.
*  So is that his that his quote?
*  Do you say that, though? Because it's weird.
*  It's saying the quote is that he said he would attack Beijing.
*  And so in quotes that way, is that his quote, though?
*  Attack Beijing if China invaded Taiwan on his watch.
*  Did he actually say that?
*  Or is this a retelling of what this person is saying?
*  And they're putting that in quotes.
*  The whole thing is a little slippery.
*  It is slippery because if you're not
*  is suggested at a fundraising event, he would have bombed Moscow.
*  Like that seems like you should have that quote.
*  You yeah, you would think Trump makes sweeping promises to donors
*  on audacious fundraising tour doesn't say anything in there about bombing, does it?
*  In the Washington Post.
*  Google just do a find on this big ass article and look for bomb.
*  Oh, here it goes.
*  OK, for example, at one event, he suggested he would have bombed
*  Moscow and Beijing if Russia invaded Ukraine and China or China invaded Taiwan,
*  surprising some of the donors.
*  But you don't have the quote.
*  He said it before with John Daly with the golfer.
*  He did say, I told Vladimir I'd hit Moscow.
*  He did say that.
*  And he did say that he said, and you can you can get this.
*  He did say to John Daly, he basically said, like, listen, I told him,
*  I said, if you go in, we'll hit Moscow.
*  And Trump said, I don't know if he believed me or not,
*  but you just got to say these things, you know, he was kind of telegraph again.
*  But listen, I think that, you know, there's probably a value to some of that talk.
*  No, no, it's funny.
*  During the last four years, because he knew he couldn't.
*  It's funny how she didn't bother you either.
*  Yeah, no, she didn't bother me.
*  And he told him the same thing.
*  John Daly getting hammered, chatting it up with the president.
*  Guys got an amazing line.
*  I got to get that guy in here.
*  Yeah. John Daly, if you're out there. Epic.
*  Let's get hammered. Yeah.
*  But so, I mean, who knows if he said it, the fundraiser or not.
*  They are slippery and they do attribute things to him.
*  And there's maybe more context to it.
*  Yeah, it's real hard to know.
*  But just saying that's crazy.
*  Yeah. I don't know if you believe me, maybe five percent.
*  Yeah, but I think maybe that's good.
*  There's something good about a maniac when you have a maniac in there
*  who is, you know, a guy that's unpredictable.
*  I think maybe Kim Jong Un, you know, when he would do that
*  and then Trump was on the other end of that, maybe that was perhaps helpful.
*  Maybe not. I don't know.
*  But do you really want to be playing chicken with fucking Russia?
*  No, I think we got to chill.
*  Yeah, I think we got to chill across the board.
*  It doesn't feel like we're chilling.
*  It feels like every and it feels like we're on this inevitable course
*  towards World War Three.
*  It's every article and headline is that guys, let's pull it back.
*  Yeah. Let's have a summer here.
*  Yeah, let's relax a little, you know, but it's not going to relax
*  because it's getting close to November and everybody's got to be terrified.
*  Oh, my God. Aren't you?
*  Well, depending on which which, you know,
*  article I read or media I consume, I don't know.
*  It feels like.
*  They're doing a lot to keep him from running, you know?
*  I mean, you have the Stormy Daniels thing, which was a misdemeanor.
*  It's, you know, this was elevated to this felony, you know, it was like
*  it would have never been prosecuted had he not been running for president.
*  People that scares the shit out of me.
*  That's terrible. And that stuff's crazy.
*  Absolutely. And the Republicans are going to do it back.
*  So now you're going to have
*  because they weaponized the government against, you know,
*  when you had like the Steele dossier and Hillary Clinton, you had all of this.
*  What ended up being, you know, faulty intelligence about him being
*  controlled by Russia, and then they had all of these investigations
*  and spent all of this time and energy trying to get him and couldn't.
*  And then they tried to get him on like
*  inflating the prices of the buildings he owns.
*  And now they finally got him on
*  paying hush money to someone, to a porn star.
*  Well, what they got him on was the inappropriate
*  the way they put it in the ledger.
*  Right. The way they put it in the ledger, the way they enter. Right.
*  Yeah. 34 times and 34 different felonies.
*  And I know people that hate Trump that go we shouldn't.
*  They shouldn't have done that. Well, that's scary.
*  Someone if he gets into office, you don't think that judges
*  and prosecutors that are sympathetic to him would do the same thing.
*  Absolutely. That's probably what's scaring the Biden people more than anything.
*  Is the retribution.
*  I mean, this guy is a means of addictive guys.
*  Always been a guy that goes after people, go after him.
*  You know, he hits back harder than they hit him.
*  And if they're doing this to him and he knows all the people that did it.
*  Well, you have all the guys now, his guys, right?
*  Badm, Stephen Miller, all these guys, they are all saying,
*  hey, where are you?
*  D.A.'s all over the country start bringing cases against prominent Democrats.
*  Yeah, they're worried.
*  They're worried.
*  You know, they're worried because if if Trump doesn't get in, then
*  do you remember what happened when Trump lost?
*  And then all these people were saying everybody who supported him,
*  they should be on a list like, right. Whoa.
*  No, it's insane. Whoa.
*  Are they willing to start a world war before this election?
*  That's interesting. That's interesting.
*  Are they willing to start a world war before this election?
*  What are they willing to do? What are they not willing to do?
*  Well, maybe a world war gets started because they don't want Trump in office.
*  Maybe someone else does it.
*  I'm wondering how far they're willing to go.
*  I'm also wondering how other countries, like you just said,
*  will might take advantage.
*  Yeah, maybe they would take advantage
*  because they know that's the best way to keep Trump from being the president.
*  If Trump is promising all these embargoes and all this different shit
*  that he's going to do to China and everything he's going to do around the world.
*  If I was right in another country, I'd be like, we don't want that.
*  No. Like escalate things, you know,
*  right around October invade Taiwan. Yeah.
*  Over. Yeah. See what happens.
*  I mean, that's the thing.
*  A lot of people are thinking that there is a possibility that you see
*  somebody makes a move. Yeah.
*  You know, but what a better time.
*  What better time to make a move than the chaos of us right now? Right.
*  You got a choice between, you know, what the Democrats keep calling a convicted
*  felon, you know, convicted felon. He's a convicted felon.
*  And they, you know, there's been all this talk about repeating that over and over
*  again, right? Like, make sure we get that.
*  No one cares. No one cares.
*  Convicted felon. Yeah. I mean, it's just such a stupid thing.
*  Well, he's got a lot of people voting for him now that wouldn't have
*  voted for him before. There's a lot of people, I think, that are also seeing the,
*  you know, it would be one thing.
*  I mean, listen, I have no nothing good to say about Gavin Newsom.
*  But if you had a guy that was had his faculties
*  could speak, yeah, was of a reasonable age or whatever, could gaslight better,
*  but the fact that you have this guy who's so old that to me does suggest for
*  whatever reason they're terrified of replacing him with someone else.
*  I do not know why. I don't know why, but it feels like
*  who's ever running things right now is does not want to does not want anybody
*  coming in and looking under the hood.
*  Yeah, right.
*  It does feel like that.
*  Like if you're in business with someone, they won't let you look at the books.
*  Why are they killing Assange every day?
*  Why are they torturing and killing Julian Assange?
*  What are they? What did Julian Assange unleash
*  that has made them do this to him,
*  where they're slowly and methodically killing him in front of everybody?
*  Well, they can't stop now. Right.
*  They've been doing it for so long.
*  They can't stop now because then he becomes a martyr with no consequences.
*  And the same people go and talk about Alexei Navalny
*  and try to get you to be upset that Vladimir Putin, which made no sense.
*  Why would Putin kill a guy who was not?
*  I'm not saying Putin's an angel, but Navalny was never a threat to Putin in any way.
*  He was in a Siberian prison.
*  And that week that we were having that vote
*  about 60 billion for the Ukraine,
*  Putin kills his biggest critic publicly.
*  That's insane. That makes no sense to anybody.
*  And what do you think happened?
*  Well, if I had to guess, there's two ways.
*  And Alexei Navalny might have just died.
*  People can't just die.
*  But it seems like if there was any group of people
*  that had a benefit from Alexei Navalny dying when he did,
*  it's not Russia. It would be us.
*  If we're trying to pass to a country that's a little war
*  weary and a little tired of going, we don't really need.
*  Why are we in this? What is the end game in Ukraine?
*  What does it look like? How much money should we be kicking over there?
*  We're trying to pass that bill, get that through Congress.
*  It's we have to portray Vladimir Putin as a monster who's unwilling to negotiate.
*  We have to do that in order to fund that war.
*  We have to present him as a guy who's hell bent on taking over Europe
*  and that that war is in our vital national security interest.
*  And the more we can paint him as that person,
*  the better it is and the more likely we are to be able to pass that bill.
*  And it's just very weird if he wanted to get rid of Alexei Navalny,
*  that he would have done it then.
*  But wasn't that guy in a terrible prison?
*  And he was in a bad prison.
*  And I mean, obviously, Putin hated him.
*  Putin hated him, but Putin, they had tried to poison him already.
*  The FSB had already tried to poison Navalny.
*  So why wouldn't you think they just did it again?
*  Why? Why? What would be the point?
*  He's in that prison. They want him dead because Putin just wants him dead.
*  So the week the week that the week that America
*  Alexei Navalny never had widespread support in Russia, by the way.
*  This is not true.
*  He had certain people that liked what he was doing.
*  He never had widespread support in Russia.
*  This is a Western narrative that's cooked up.
*  That's completely untrue.
*  Alexei Navalny started his life as a guy who was would criticize Jews.
*  He had a lot of fascist tendencies.
*  And then after a little trip to Europe and maybe meeting with, I don't know,
*  who knows who knows who people meet with.
*  He decided to go back to Russia with a very pro-Western attitude.
*  And he changed course.
*  I'm not saying why people do that.
*  People see the light in all different ways.
*  The point is, the guy's in a Siberian prison.
*  America is about to pass a huge bill.
*  If you're the president of Russia, are you killing him that week?
*  That just to me is a question.
*  Hmm.
*  How did he die?
*  What are they saying?
*  But now they said something recently.
*  They said they found that he wasn't killed.
*  They came out with something they conducted.
*  Now, I don't know.
*  I don't know who's conducting this, whether it's a human rights watch or an international.
*  You're dying slow in jail, no matter what.
*  You know, if you're in a Russian jail.
*  Yeah, you're in a Russian jail. What are you eating?
*  And I'm not saying Navalny wasn't a patriot or whatever, but I'm just saying that,
*  like the idea that killing him.
*  Right.
*  You know, maybe the guy did love Russia.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe the guy was an egomaniacal guy who just wanted to lead.
*  He wanted to be the leader.
*  Maybe he was working with us.
*  I don't know.
*  But if you just look at it from a logical standpoint, it's weird that they killed him that week.
*  Hmm.
*  That's strange to me.
*  Does it make any sense?
*  Interesting.
*  I don't know enough about it to comment.
*  Well, I would imagine if you want to go, that should never limit any of us.
*  How did he die?
*  Sudden death syndrome.
*  Oh.
*  Given notice of a death, Navalny's spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, said the time of his death,
*  notice at 2 17 p.m. local time, when Alexi's lawyer and mother arrived at the colony this morning,
*  they were told that the cause of Navalny's death was sudden death syndrome.
*  That's a vague term for different cardiac syndromes that cause sudden cardiac arrest and death.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe they just killed him.
*  Listen, of course they might have killed him.
*  More likely, right?
*  Felt unwell for a walk, almost immediately losing consciousness.
*  He also just might have died in a jail.
*  He might have.
*  How old was he?
*  Oh, that's pretty young.
*  Just dropped out of a heart attack.
*  It's certainly possible that they killed him.
*  It's just all of these events that we're told very little about, you have to then just rest
*  on your own.
*  I don't know.
*  It's very possible they killed him.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't live there.
*  What do I know?
*  It's very possible they killed him.
*  Alex, how are you thinking though?
*  You're thinking like 4D chess.
*  Well, no, I'm thinking like, you know, the way when he dies, people go, he was a big threat
*  and Putin had to vanquish him.
*  Was he?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Does anyone consume Russian media or listen to Russian podcasts?
*  I've listened to Russian podcasts.
*  I hear the way Russians talk like, I know people that live there.
*  We hear a lot of stuff and then there's what we hear and then what's happening.
*  Doesn't mean that it's great.
*  I'd rather live here.
*  But it does mean that like this idea that there was a movement, like remember when the
*  hot dog warlord guy, Progosian was going through and everybody was salivating on social media
*  being like, no, no, no, he's about to overthrow the Kremlin.
*  It's going to happen.
*  And it didn't happen.
*  No, he's not.
*  If he did, he's a fucking warlord.
*  He's a warlord.
*  If he did, he's going to be worse.
*  But it didn't happen because nobody has a fucking clue what's going on over there.
*  So it's just you have to end then Assange.
*  They're killing this guy in slow motion and then telling us how outraged we should be
*  about Navalny.
*  When Assange comes out, leaks a bunch of emails, we find out we're committing war crimes.
*  We find out the CIA can remotely hijack your car.
*  We find out that they can use all kinds of smartphone features to record you, all that
*  stuff.
*  He releases, I forget what it's called, Vault 7 or Vault 5.
*  I think it's 7, but I don't know.
*  I forgot the name of the vault.
*  But he releases all of these things.
*  Troves of Clinton emails, you know, and I'm not saying pizza gate was real, but I've never
*  in my life been like, have 50 hot dogs ready for the guy when he comes.
*  Like, no one talks like, I don't know what they were talking about, but no one has ever
*  communicated like that.
*  Ever once, those emails.
*  The most bizarre.
*  Read those emails.
*  Nobody has ever communicated like that ever ago.
*  Well, I hope there's 50 hot dogs or something.
*  The president's going to love some of these good hot dogs.
*  Maybe we shouldn't have our hot dog parties at the White House.
*  Things that are so crazy when you read them, you don't know.
*  This doesn't seem to make any sense.
*  And they're talking about kids.
*  And they're talking about weird shit.
*  It seems coded.
*  It seems weirdly coded.
*  It's like it seems so coded that I would assume that it's misinformation, that it's fake, that
*  someone released it.
*  It's like, who knows?
*  Sort of a fake.
*  But I don't think it is.
*  I don't think it's ever been claimed.
*  I don't think it's ever been claimed to not have been their actual emails.
*  Very strange.
*  And they have these emails that are all very weird and strange.
*  Seth Rich gets killed.
*  And anybody who thinks that Seth Rich might have got murdered because of leaking to WikiLeaks,
*  even though Assange alluded to it.
*  Right.
*  You're a conspiracy theorist.
*  You're a nut.
*  Well, wait a minute.
*  Do you or do you not think that sometimes people kill people?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, these people are crazy.
*  And you see a clear motive here.
*  You see a thing here.
*  That's a real big thing.
*  And if you pursue that at all, if you even question that at all, if you even look into
*  it at all.
*  They left his wallet.
*  They left his phone.
*  They didn't steal anything from him.
*  It was not a mugging.
*  Just murdered him.
*  It was not a mugging.
*  It was a murder.
*  You don't think that's weird?
*  It's very strange.
*  People go, oh, it was a bad area.
*  It was whatever.
*  Yes, but there was no economic crime.
*  Like there you were.
*  Not only that, they left his stuff.
*  That's right.
*  They shot him and just left whatever he had.
*  They left all that.
*  Even if it wasn't a robbery.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're the type of person who's going to shoot someone, you're going to leave their
*  money with them?
*  You had all of that happening at the same time that high up members of the national security
*  apparatus in this country were coming out going, we have information that the president
*  of the United States is either working for Russia, conspiring, has conspired with Russia.
*  Had girls pee on him.
*  Had girls pee on him.
*  They were accusing him of treason.
*  And I remember this.
*  They were accusing the guy of treason.
*  This was not like he got a blow job in the Oval Office.
*  This was his, this is treason.
*  And his supporters enabled a coup in our country backed by Russia.
*  None of that two years, three years on TV.
*  And everybody repeated it.
*  Everyone repeated it.
*  No one has since apologized.
*  Nobody has said we were wrong.
*  Nobody has shown any interest in getting to the bottom of how that happened.
*  They cook up this fake steel dossier claiming all these things, the pee tape, all that stuff.
*  All of this intelligence ends up being, you know, for lack of a better word, pretty unsourced.
*  And the Clinton campaign paid for that dossier.
*  And so all of that stuff, unreal how corrupt.
*  Now when you zoom out and you look and then you go, well, there's this old guy with dementia
*  that they don't want to give up on.
*  And then you zoom out and you go, oh, maybe there is something else happening.
*  I don't know.
*  Jesus.
*  Who the fuck knows?
*  You can only say this if you have these glasses on.
*  Yeah, you feel better.
*  If you take them off, you immediately become a normie and you can't.
*  And you feel nervous about it.
*  You feel nervous.
*  You start going, I like Biden.
*  I like that he's a family man, which someone said the other day.
*  He's a good man.
*  A family man.
*  He's a good man.
*  The family.
*  The sons, the son right now, our president's son right now is in court trying to convince
*  a judge that he was not smoking crack when he bought a gun.
*  Is he the first guy to ever get arrested for that?
*  I don't know.
*  But that's such a funny thing that that's literally what the son of the president's
*  doing right now is he's they've got his ex-wife testifying, ex-girlfriend.
*  Yeah, not just like smoking.
*  He was saying smoking crack every hour on the hour.
*  Yeah.
*  And one of them, I think his ex-wife or ex-girlfriend said she was witnessing him do it every 20
*  minutes, which is kind of impressive.
*  How do you stay alive?
*  Yeah.
*  But all the people that have died of overdoses, that guy's out there keep on trucking.
*  That's right.
*  Dropping accidental packages in the White House.
*  Well, he's fit.
*  He's kind of built for it.
*  He's built to smoke crack.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He has fun sex.
*  He can handle it.
*  Like Shane Gillis can handle beer.
*  Absolutely.
*  Some people can just handle stuff.
*  And you know, I don't even want him to stop smoking crack.
*  I don't think he stopped.
*  Sure.
*  And I hope he's.
*  No, no, no.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, listen, whatever.
*  It's great.
*  They're all great.
*  They found coke in the White House.
*  You know, I had a chance to I had a chance to get him on the podcast.
*  Oh, Joe.
*  I know early, early, early on when he was releasing a book before the laptop stuff for
*  all the shit hit the fan.
*  Oh, well, then that might have sucked.
*  I don't know.
*  I think I could have.
*  You could have.
*  You could have opened the whenever they were.
*  He was going to go on.
*  I think they canceled all of it, though.
*  Yeah, I think when the shit started, it probably never would have happened because I think
*  once things started going sideways, I think he did a couple of interviews before things
*  went completely sideways.
*  I think it was because of a book.
*  It was before he was selling those paintings.
*  Yes.
*  An artist for like half a billion.
*  This is a sensitive soul.
*  The pain is a sensitive soul.
*  He lives in Malibu.
*  He's an artist.
*  Paintings are a crazy way to fund the fuck.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's great money laundering scheme.
*  It really is.
*  It's the best.
*  It's a great way to do it.
*  And, you know, it's interesting.
*  It's like the CIA.
*  There's there's real evidence now the CIA was involved in Jackson Pollock.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know that, right?
*  Which makes sense.
*  Of course.
*  Paintings were terrible.
*  Not only were they bad, but all of that whole era of art, they were kind of.
*  And that was it was like it was it also fucked with people's heads because people
*  looked at those paintings going, I could do that.
*  Right.
*  Easily.
*  And capitalism only works if you have respect for the accomplishments of other people.
*  You've got to be able to look at people and go, I can't do that.
*  Bro, there's some work like that that is insanely expensive.
*  Yeah.
*  And it just splatters.
*  And you're like, what what is this?
*  Well, it's a great way to get over on the right.
*  People think rich people always get over.
*  It's not true.
*  Rich people get beat all the time by other rich people.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because they all agree that there are certain kinds of bullshit that they tolerate.
*  And one of them is like they buy this crap art that is like this modern art that, you know,
*  one was a blank canvas once it sold for 200 grand, like all this stuff like that.
*  How much do you think that went for?
*  Five million dollars.
*  Tim, any guess?
*  What is is a Pollock?
*  Yeah.
*  An original?
*  No, no, it's not.
*  It's not Pollock?
*  I don't think so.
*  Someone else?
*  I'll show you the answer if I looked.
*  I say five million dollars.
*  I'll say I'll say two million.
*  Three hundred million.
*  Two weeks of the Ukraine War.
*  That's two weeks of the Ukraine War.
*  That painting.
*  That is so crazy.
*  Can we just give the Ukraine that and have them sell it?
*  Can we just give them art like that and have them repurpose it?
*  What is it?
*  William de Kooning.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  OK, so it's 55.
*  Is the head of the in the middle of the CIA?
*  Yeah, this is when they were doing this.
*  So was this American guy who did it?
*  The CEO of Citadel bought it.
*  Oh my God.
*  What a fucking asshole.
*  You know, you made a great point about chaos.
*  You just need a certain amount of chaos.
*  And with this crap, it just starts driving people crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that chaos ends up becoming the point.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a factor.
*  You know, it's like noise.
*  Like if you want to kill somebody, turn up the music so no one hears them scream.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's interesting when you see them really get involved in culture in the 60s and they
*  are in Laurel Canyon.
*  They're in Haydash Berry.
*  Oh, they were involved in everything.
*  And they're working with everybody.
*  You've had that guy on your show wrote that great book about Manson and all that stuff.
*  And they're involved with cults.
*  They're involved with everybody.
*  That's actually the painting.
*  The one I had up that it showed was not the correct.
*  Oh, this is the one?
*  That one still sucks.
*  That's 300 million.
*  That's even less impressive.
*  Dude, that's worse.
*  That one's less good.
*  If I bought the other one for $400, I'd feel better.
*  That's like something a guy like me picks out.
*  The other one was 27.6 million.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Reasonable.
*  Yeah.
*  Good Lord.
*  Is it the same artist?
*  I don't think so.
*  So this guy, what is the big deal about this guy?
*  I didn't.
*  I don't know.
*  I just, I was looking through another article.
*  God, these are garbage.
*  That's a garbage painting.
*  The top 15 from the top 15.
*  The top 15 from 2020.
*  And I was like, the very first one it shows was the one I just showed you.
*  Oh, but that's number 15.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's 27 million.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is the most expensive works of art.
*  Oh, look at this one.
*  How much does that piece of shit, bro?
*  That's something my daughter would have done.
*  She was four.
*  28.7.
*  28.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  It's fake.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is money laundering.
*  This is money laundering.
*  Well, then there's Picasso.
*  The Picasso is actually kind of cool though.
*  Look at that one.
*  The Picasso one's kind of cool.
*  But it's destroying the difference.
*  Like by elevating a lot of the other stuff, they're also muddying the waters.
*  Look at this one.
*  It's all blue.
*  Yeah, except that one line.
*  There's a line down the middle.
*  How much is that one?
*  30.1.
*  That's the thin blue line.
*  30 million dollars.
*  This one's a black, red with a black square at the bottom.
*  21 million dollars.
*  This is insane.
*  Oh, that's a dinosaur though.
*  That's pretty dope.
*  Well, that's fun.
*  That's pretty dope.
*  That belongs in a Miami penthouse first floor.
*  I looked at a house in Beverly Hills when I was thinking about living in Beverly Hills,
*  and it had a dinosaur in it.
*  See, that's cool.
*  You could buy the dinosaur for like an extra million.
*  The Persians are fun.
*  Yes.
*  Because they own those places.
*  I have a dinosaur.
*  There's one guy.
*  You don't have a dinosaur?
*  There's one guy there that has white tigers in the backyard.
*  What?
*  He has like a white tiger thing in his backyard.
*  Actual white tigers?
*  Yes.
*  You're allowed to do that?
*  No.
*  So it's not allowed.
*  He's just bawling.
*  He doesn't care.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  But it's kind of well known.
*  Well known that he has tigers?
*  Maybe not amongst the people that would.
*  It is now.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  Now people go.
*  What's the address?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  They don't invite me.
*  I'm going to be standing there with the tiger.
*  Do you ever see that show, The Shaw's of Sunset?
*  Yes.
*  It's all the rich Persians.
*  Yes.
*  Tarangeles.
*  They call LA Tarangeles.
*  Which is fun.
*  There is something fun about those people.
*  I like the gold and the gaudy and the glitter.
*  Wasps, to me, they're like the fading wasp empire where they're loaded, but they drive
*  like a shitty beater car.
*  I don't like that.
*  And they wear loafers.
*  I like how you do it.
*  I like how I do it, which is disgusting and vulgar.
*  And it shows people that money isn't even good.
*  The way I live proves that money isn't even good.
*  I buy things at Dior.
*  When I walk into these stores, I buy a dumb hoodie or something that looks crazy or a
*  feathered coat or whatever.
*  And people see me in it.
*  They go, you know what?
*  So what?
*  So what?
*  We don't have a lot.
*  Look at this idiot.
*  Capitalism needs people like me to go out and do things that are so buffoonish.
*  It makes people go, you know what?
*  This whole thing, money ain't it.
*  Money ain't it.
*  Let's just go to the lake.
*  But it is something gross about, I like when people that don't have money, because I never
*  had money and then at 37, I had money at 36.
*  And then you do dumb shit.
*  No one, my parents had no money.
*  No one's smart that does what I do.
*  But that's okay.
*  The only smart thing I've done is I have some houses so I can't pick them up and snort them
*  or whatever.
*  But nobody buys the kind of dumb sunglasses or dumb bentleys.
*  Nobody does that if they have a clue.
*  My parents, my mother was a swim teacher and my father was a wine salesman.
*  They were good people.
*  But we didn't know anything about money.
*  We never learned about money.
*  We had no idea about money.
*  So I just, you know, I just, when you get money, you go, I should do things like go
*  to Beverly Hills and get like a very shiny, gross, grotesque car.
*  Because that's what it is.
*  That's all point of Beverly Hills.
*  You get a nice car.
*  You drive up to one of these restaurants, the valets park it.
*  They go, that's a nice car.
*  And then you just go, thank you.
*  That's the whole interaction.
*  You go, thank you so much.
*  You go, thank you.
*  You want to get that thank you.
*  You want to get the admiring looks.
*  What you should tell them is you should tell them you should go, I live in hell.
*  And then just walk in.
*  You should go, I'm owned.
*  Because a lot of those people are.
*  You should just go.
*  Especially if you're like at the margins.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, you really shouldn't have that car?
*  That's right.
*  Well, a real estate agent told me once that New York was a $50 million house cash and
*  LA was a $50 million house with a $48 million mortgage.
*  She said people on the West Coast are just leveraged.
*  The money's newer.
*  It's different.
*  It's not, you know, it's old, I guess.
*  So then people just there.
*  And there's more like keeping up with the Jones's attitude, perhaps.
*  Well, LA is filled with that.
*  Filled with that.
*  That's the whole thing.
*  It's like fake it till you make it.
*  It's the influencer culture.
*  People are renting houses and cars.
*  That's right.
*  And taking pictures in front of them like blessed.
*  And now I think it's just not even fake it till you make it, it's just fake it till you
*  fake it.
*  You just gotta keep faking it.
*  Yeah, just keep faking it.
*  You gotta keep faking it.
*  As you make it, fake it harder.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And we were just talking about the average price of a home in LA.
*  Is it California itself or LA?
*  California itself.
*  The average price of a home is $1 million, which is absurd.
*  So crazy.
*  So crazy.
*  That's so much money.
*  And then the average income is like $60,000, right?
*  $62 is the thing I saw.
*  $62 is the average income.
*  $1 million is the average home.
*  It's unsustainable.
*  That whole thing.
*  Yeah, but that's beyond.
*  Could you imagine the fucking fear that you would have if you had a $1 million mortgage
*  and you made $60,000 a year?
*  What's worse about this whole thing?
*  Go look at the houses for a million bucks.
*  They're dumps.
*  They're not even nice.
*  No.
*  It's crazy what you don't get there.
*  Right.
*  You'd have to live in Palmdale to get a nice house for a million dollars.
*  You know what it is?
*  It's pretty.
*  California is the girl that's just hot and forever has been hot.
*  But ruins your life.
*  Right.
*  It's just pretty.
*  It's stunningly beautiful.
*  There are parts of it like Montecito or Santa Barbara.
*  This is so pretty.
*  But everybody there's houses burned down four times.
*  They're on their third divorce.
*  There's been mudslides.
*  There are kids in rehab.
*  But it's pretty.
*  A lady I looked at with a house up there, she died in a mudslide.
*  The real estate lady that showed us the house.
*  This is what happens.
*  But they'll tell you that in the way they talk.
*  Santa Barbara, it's always sunset and they have this voice.
*  And they tell you the worst things about something in the very nice Conway and they go, this
*  is beautiful.
*  It's a remodel because it burned down and the family was in it.
*  But it burned down and it's a remodel and they did a great job and the finishes are
*  beautiful.
*  And you know, you're not in the path of the mudslide.
*  You're not in the direct path.
*  But you're in, you know, you're in an area that can have seismic activity.
*  We don't love that.
*  You know, the fire department and they got cold on this, like did the vegetation or something
*  so that when the floods hit, Montecito was kind of spared.
*  Like they tried and they got called out on us.
*  Like the LA Fire Department or whatever was like they had to do certain things.
*  They prioritize like that area over all the other areas.
*  Well, the problem is like the fire hits, the vegetation gets burned down and then they
*  get the mudslides because they don't have anything protecting the erosion anymore.
*  Right. Right.
*  And that's what happened.
*  They had a big fire up there, which they have all the time.
*  I mean, when I lived in L.A.
*  where I lived, I was we were evacuated three times.
*  Wow. Three times.
*  One time, I mean, you burnt the fucking next door neighbor's house to a clarity.
*  It's by 2030, but it's still 900000.
*  Oh, now I just saw.
*  OK. Only 900000.
*  It's a bargain. It's crazy.
*  It's a bargain for someone to make sixty two thousand dollars a year.
*  Yeah. Just imagine being in the hole like that.
*  This is the whole problem because you can't make even if you made sixty
*  two thousand dollars a year and had zero expenses.
*  Right. And didn't have to pay taxes.
*  Yeah. It still is going to take you this fucking forever to pay that off.
*  You're never going to be able to write off before we build.
*  We engineered this crisis.
*  We chose. We allowed this to happen.
*  We let foreign billionaires buy stuff.
*  We let our own companies buy residential real estate.
*  We let it all happen.
*  And it's right before we could enact laws.
*  We could stop it. Anything that's happening could be stopped.
*  But it's right before they start telling people, OK, live in a pod.
*  Live in this pod.
*  This is right before they start introducing like, OK, you know what?
*  It's too expensive for you. Guess what?
*  We got here's the good news.
*  We've got and they're just going to 3D printed housing everywhere
*  in the middle of the desert.
*  It's going to be a nightmare.
*  Funds, right? Funds buying up houses,
*  residential houses, they do it all the time.
*  Yeah, they're doing a lot now.
*  They do it all the time.
*  But I do feel like we are right there where it's going to get so bad,
*  where they're just going to start with their 3D printing or whatever
*  they're doing, where they're just going to have houses and go, here we go.
*  Here we go. They're all together.
*  They're all, you know, you're not great.
*  15-minute city. There's no reason for you to go outside of your 15-minute city.
*  You have it. You have a little park over here.
*  Go to your park and you're going to live in that and you're going to have an app
*  and your whole life will be an app.
*  There'll be an app with your city.
*  Yeah, everything will be on the app.
*  Check in when you get outside.
*  You won't need to own a car.
*  You won't need to own a house.
*  It'll be a countdown.
*  That's right. You leave the 15 minutes.
*  That's right. You have 40 hours to return.
*  And then climate change is going to be the big reason they'll use.
*  They'll say because of climate, we're limiting automobile ownership.
*  We're limiting this. We're limiting that.
*  And that seems to be the next step.
*  Yeah, that's a scary one.
*  The climate thing is a scary one because they're using it just like they use
*  everything else. And you have to be a good person.
*  So you want to try climate change.
*  You want to support the right measures.
*  You want to do your part.
*  You don't want to be a psychopath.
*  We got to kill these cows. They're making methane.
*  These people are bad people, you know, that are doing these things
*  like leaving their home.
*  They're sick. Do you want to be sick?
*  So that's inevitably, I think what happens is all of these
*  because all of these things are it's a crisis that's not this is not organic.
*  Right. It's not organic that all of these cities are being bought up.
*  None of this was inevitable.
*  All of this could have been stopped.
*  And it is right now not being stopped.
*  Yeah. Average income, 62000, average house, 900000.
*  And the response to that is, and then what happens when automation
*  takes over 80 percent of the jobs?
*  Then there's got it. Then they got to do the World War.
*  Then we they got to get rid of everybody.
*  What do you think? A lot of people.
*  Do you think when automation takes over, there's some sort of a massive
*  decrease in population?
*  Do you think they they provide universal basic income?
*  What do you think they do? I don't know what they do.
*  I think that it seems like right now they're they're preparing for a world war.
*  That genuinely, if you if you were to zoom out and read the news.
*  Dispassionately, like without wanting any answer to come float to the surface.
*  It seems like they are preparing for a world war.
*  Every article is like conflict with China, inevitable within five years.
*  Say many generals. Yeah.
*  Every article, every national, every league, Pentagon League is
*  U.S. readiness needs to be, you know, within five years, a conflict is inevitable.
*  You know, the draft, you know, military times, we should bring the draft back.
*  Like, you know, Europe, the future of Europe is in doubt.
*  So the military times said that.
*  Yeah, we certainly recently they had a.
*  Article. Arguing, I believe, for the return of selective service for the draft.
*  And it's definitely something that
*  it's being talked about, you know, Germany talked about it recently
*  because of the Ukraine, Russia thing.
*  And there's this idea now that, yeah,
*  lawmakers move to automate selective service registration for all men.
*  Whoa. A new plan from the House
*  lawmakers would automatically register men for potential military
*  draft when they hit 18, avoiding potential legal consequences
*  connected to failing to file the paperwork at the proper time.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Mandate automatic registration of all males between 18 and 26
*  living in America in the selective service system.
*  Federal database used for a military draft in case of national emergency.
*  Oh, huh. Huh.
*  Oh, that gets fun with the male male part.
*  Yeah. Yeah, of course.
*  What about trans men?
*  Trans what about them? Trans men are men.
*  Get them in. Yeah. Time to be men now.
*  That's what I'm saying. Let's go.
*  So it does seem like they're preparing for something.
*  And it does seem like it's weird.
*  It's weird. There's a weirdness in the air.
*  100 percent. There's a weirdness in the air.
*  Yeah, this is late stage civilization vibes.
*  For sure. It gives us we got late stage civilization vibes,
*  no matter how we slice it.
*  You might make it through this.
*  Yeah, I might look back at this.
*  I do. Tim and Joe were so crazy.
*  Yeah, they're making a big deal out of it.
*  Nothing happened.
*  Or this could be one of those things that people play.
*  If you can find a power source.
*  I saved it on my phone. Yeah.
*  Let's watch. They were talking about it.
*  Well, it's also like what scares me more than anything
*  is the people who aren't feeling this way.
*  Did you see what they did where they gave Starlink Internet
*  to ask tribe in the Amazon and they all start jerking off?
*  I talked about it on my show this week.
*  They're addicted to porn and social media instantly.
*  And they overnight, the elders, tribe elders are freaking out
*  because they thought it was in control.
*  Yeah, they thought it was going to be great at first.
*  But now everyone's lazy. No one wants to work.
*  They all just flip into their phones all day.
*  They're in the jungle and they're going through their phone
*  because at first it's great to look a picture of a flower.
*  Yeah. And then three days later, it's like there's guys
*  watching women get choked and kicked and whatever.
*  And now they're like losing control.
*  Yeah. They're on TikTok all day.
*  And that's what you look at.
*  You know, you know, all of the it's that's why it's so important
*  that the tech people all be on the same page for the most part
*  because that's the way you lose control the quickest.
*  And it seems to be very important and somewhat engineered,
*  maybe not top down, but somewhat coincidental that
*  90 percent of the tech people are all on the same page.
*  Well, at most things, those are the type of people, though.
*  They're all ideologically captured.
*  That's all the left. The tech is all the left.
*  There's some libertarians, but very few, very few.
*  Those are the rebels to have those people in charge of everything.
*  It's just so. But it was weird because we had Republicans
*  and Democratic bankers for a long time and no one really cared.
*  But there's something about the tech people where it's like, we can't.
*  It seems like they don't want to let
*  there be any diversity in thought with that group because they're they
*  the levers they hold are too consequential.
*  But they were that way before the levers were consequential.
*  Sure. Except for Microsoft. Right.
*  If you think about Microsoft, they were like liberal, but not financially.
*  Like they were very, very shrewd. Right.
*  Financially, they're all liberal.
*  If you can be liberal and have a 25 million dollar house in Atherton, California.
*  If that's part of it.
*  And I think that's part of the way we've designed liberal.
*  Yeah. In America, then.
*  Well, they're just so removed.
*  They're very removed from the consequences of what they're interested in.
*  And when you talk to them, you don't you do get the feeling
*  that they are fully in.
*  They fully believe and for good reason that they control the country now.
*  Yeah. And they think they should.
*  That's because they're the smart ones and they're on the right side.
*  That's correct. And we have to do everything we can.
*  And so when they complied with the government, you know,
*  when they eliminated things from social media that were problematic
*  to the narrative, whether it was on YouTube or Twitter or whatever they did.
*  Like they thought they were doing the right thing
*  and that they should be doing this because the people they these people are stupid.
*  I think everyone thinks they're doing the right thing.
*  And I think the thing that surprises me the most is how a lot of those people,
*  those positions of power aren't cynical.
*  They aren't, you know, you you really would like them to just go,
*  yeah, it's all bullshit. We're doing what we have to do.
*  You you'd almost rather that right.
*  But they truly believe they believe they believe what they're saying.
*  They really do. They do.
*  And I think that's if you're in the deep cover CIA agent, you believe.
*  I think if you're high up in the military, you believe.
*  I think if you're in the tech industry, you believe.
*  I think no matter where you are, you believe because so much of your identity
*  becomes dependent on that. Yes, for sure.
*  Also, like I experienced that when I was working on a television show
*  when people used to try to tell me, you know, oh, the government is programming it
*  and they're programming these shows to make these shows so that we're stupid.
*  And people would believe that. I'm like, you don't understand the people
*  making these shows like these shows and watch these shows.
*  They try to make these shows.
*  There's no one telling them to make these shows this way,
*  other than the people that are saying this way, this would make us money. Right.
*  That's all they're doing. That's right.
*  Like you've got this idea that like this is like design,
*  like fear factors designed to make people stupid. Right.
*  No, everybody had a good time.
*  The people making it had a good time.
*  The people making it watch those shows.
*  Yeah. Like, have you seen Survivor?
*  They're all they're all watching them.
*  Well, they're all in the culture.
*  Every time Sam Smith, you know, or somebody dresses up like a devil
*  or tries to do something edgy, everyone talks about, well, this is like
*  this engineered thing.
*  And I'm like, listen, a lot of it is people are trying to get attention.
*  A hundred percent what they're trying to do.
*  So we saw him Smith. Right.
*  And you can't be.
*  And I talked about it when people were like really enraged about it.
*  And I'm like, if you are like going to be a non binary,
*  different, you know, I'm going to sell sex.
*  You can't look like my uncle.
*  And that's what Sam Smith looked.
*  And they were like, well, no, he's a Satanist.
*  I go, if Satan saw him and said, that's who's my representative on a
*  Sam Smith looks like my uncle at a Halloween party. He's drunk.
*  That's what he looked like.
*  It's really does.
*  He looks like a guy like me or somebody I would have grown up with.
*  No. So he doesn't have that bowie thing.
*  It is not that sexy thing.
*  I think it's far less they're putting messages into corrupt people.
*  I think maybe there's people that certainly do that.
*  I think overall, it's that
*  people are lazy and want attention.
*  Yeah, it's a lot easier to get attention that way than to keep being good at something.
*  Dressing up like the devil is one of the best ways to get attention.
*  That's right. It's one of the oldest ways.
*  You remember the outrage for the little laws X video?
*  Of course, Satan, the lap dance.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Give us a little money on the blood.
*  And again, I'm not saying it's great for a five year old, but it's like
*  focus more on the house as being a million bucks.
*  Focus more on all that stuff, because that's the stuff I think that
*  a long term potential draft.
*  Focus more on the potential draft in the long in the long term.
*  That's what seems to matter.
*  Yeah, but nobody is, you know, people are just so easily distracted
*  by a good Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef. Sure.
*  It's so easily.
*  It's so it's so exciting to have all these things happening all the time.
*  It's fun. It's fun.
*  It's just a weird fucking time that doesn't seem like it has any like any.
*  There's no patterns that I could see from the past, because everything's so accelerated.
*  By technology, like you could look at the chaos of the 1960s.
*  I know they threw water on that in the 70s and the 80s was all cocaine in the 90s.
*  And it took to like the 2000.
*  The Internet comes around for people to start exploring some of the ideas
*  that people were, you know, really connected to in the 60s. Yeah.
*  But now here we are.
*  No road map, no road map.
*  And everything is fucking chaotic.
*  Everything's chaotic.
*  But also, maybe we'll get like a nice abatement.
*  Like maybe for whatever reason,
*  it doesn't go in the direction that it seems like it's going. Yeah.
*  And that it has like a dead cat bounce.
*  We're essentially you know what I mean?
*  Like we're like, you know, you get 20 or 30 years out of this place or more.
*  Right. Before because you don't want to war and you don't want nukes to fly.
*  And you don't want all this stuff happening.
*  No. And you're you're doing all this while they can AI operate weapons.
*  Yes. Including jets, fighter jets that are used.
*  We have drones now that are insanely common.
*  We probably have UFOs.
*  Sure. I think a good percentage of that shit these people are saying.
*  When can you charter a UFO? That'll be fun.
*  You can charter a private jet.
*  You should be able to charter a UFO.
*  Yeah. There's already people that are doing SpaceX flights, right?
*  Yeah. You can go. You can leave our flat earth.
*  Wow. You can see the firm's fear.
*  We'll see you whenever.
*  The firmament.
*  There should be a flat earth tour that will take you to space
*  and only show you part of it.
*  Yeah. They should just give you special glasses where it looks flat.
*  My friend's mother is a flat earther.
*  He goes, what is she? What does she do?
*  I go, he goes, how do we help? I go, I don't know.
*  One of my friends, Eddie Bravo, thinks it's flat.
*  Yeah. I love him to death.
*  Yeah. What are you going to do?
*  He watches too many YouTube videos.
*  There's quite a few people that think it's flat.
*  The problem is like there's it's it's a biblical thing.
*  There's a lot of it is based on the depictions of earth
*  and the firmament and all these different things in the Bible,
*  which, by the way, was written by people.
*  You this idea that people back then had it all laid out perfectly
*  and that the word of God was translated absolutely perfectly
*  and nobody ever added their own special sauce to the mix
*  like they do with everything.
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Everything ever.
*  No, it's it's definitely interesting.
*  And I think seeing the battle between these ancient texts
*  and the most modern technology and seeing how they fuse together
*  has is going to make the planet very interesting.
*  Sure. Ancient text together with YouTube. That's right.
*  What is this Japanese billionaire
*  pulls plug on private Dear Moon lunar starship mission? Huh?
*  Why? How about this?
*  This just got announced this week.
*  Well, how much money would it cost?
*  I mean, you could go to the moon.
*  Is that what the idea was?
*  Yeah, they remember like Steve Aoki was going to be on this.
*  Oh, I was trying to tell Steve, don't do that.
*  Yeah, it's this plan. Can we go to the moon?
*  No, no one's ever been. So how could we go?
*  Well, there's got to be first person.
*  Do you think people went to the moon? I have no idea.
*  I had Bart Sabrell on the podcast.
*  And do you think he did? Yeah. Yeah.
*  Of course you do. You're deep in the conspiracy world.
*  Well, I'm deep in the truth.
*  That guy, he that guy's been on that forever.
*  I had dinner with him like 20 years ago.
*  Right. At least somewhere around 20 years ago.
*  I met with him in an Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills.
*  Yeah. And he was just laying out his case.
*  Yeah. Why the moon landing?
*  I mean, there was a book called Penetration by this guy, Ignacio Swan.
*  It was one of these remote viewing guys.
*  And that's what got me into that stuff.
*  Like some of that more stuff.
*  He wrote this book and it was about remote viewing
*  and how like the government was was using remote viewing.
*  They definitely were trying to.
*  They were trying to use it and whether they succeeded or not.
*  But, you know, I don't know.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  Is it is it is it pretty accepted that we didn't go to the moon?
*  No, no. I mean, it's controversial still.
*  It's amongst conspiracy conspiracy theorists amongst those folks.
*  Yeah. None of those folks thinks we think we went to the moon.
*  They think it was all horseshit.
*  Some people think we went to the moon, but we fake the footage. Right.
*  Because that's so us.
*  Radiation of space.
*  Yeah. And that's such an us thing to do to do it.
*  And then actually go, fuck it. We got to film something.
*  There's also like there is precedent that they did use certain photos
*  that were from obviously from training missions. Right.
*  And then they blacked out the background and tried to pretend
*  these are photos of spacewalks. Right.
*  Because if someone's like doing a spacewalk, like there's one of
*  what's his name?
*  Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin. Who's the other guy?
*  Glenn. Michael Collins.
*  There's Michael Collins in the Gemini 15.
*  And what they did was, but this could be overzealous PR people
*  that are doing this. Right. Sure. NASA.
*  They took a photograph of a mission where he was in a training mission.
*  And, you know, he's suspended by cables with the inner teaching them
*  how to use the spacewalk stuff.
*  And then they reversed the image and blacked it out, blacked out the background.
*  So you've seen you can find that.
*  So those types of things give people an indication that there's a problem.
*  Well, they give you an indication that there's a pattern of deception.
*  They're willing to lie that they're willing to at least
*  fuck with the truth for publicity purposes.
*  Sure. I want good photographs of something.
*  And if you're going to spend a whistleblower.
*  Yeah, I'm sure. So that's it.
*  So they took the photo on the left and then they just reversed it
*  to the photo on the right and blacked out the screen.
*  So the one on the left, obviously, they're in training mission.
*  The one on the right, they're pretending it's space, which is pretty wild.
*  I mean, really fucking wild. They did that.
*  That is wild. It's wild.
*  But it's you know, Boeing, more whistleblowers came out more.
*  Yeah, there's more whistleblowers.
*  Two of them were murdered, right?
*  Well, yeah, but I love you.
*  They were murdered.
*  Did they commit suicide? What happened to those folks?
*  I think they were murdered.
*  What's the story?
*  It was the official story about the two Boeing whistleblowers who got whacked.
*  Boeing's a national security company.
*  It's an American defense contractor.
*  You're working for Boeing, you're working for the government.
*  You come out and whistleblow.
*  How do the fucking FBI like that?
*  They'll get rid of you too.
*  If you started whistleblowing.
*  What's the official cause of death for the two folks?
*  I don't know. The guy was sitting in his car.
*  He shot himself.
*  One was suicide.
*  One was suicide because he was sad.
*  I would be sad, too, if I disparaged a great company like Boeing.
*  I love Boeing. I've always loved Boeing.
*  He probably realized, what have I done to disparage this great company?
*  He probably sucked as a guy.
*  No, whistleblowers aren't fun.
*  Right.
*  There's never been a whistleblower that's fun.
*  Maybe he was a fake whistleblower.
*  He knew the house of cards was coming down.
*  No pun intended.
*  You probably went out with him and he always talked about how unsafe these planes were.
*  And you're like, dude, shut up.
*  Right.
*  Shut up. I'd fly all the time.
*  A lot of people do.
*  He's basically like a flat earther.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I don't want to know how bad the planes are.
*  Let them crash.
*  Let one of them. Here's the deal.
*  No one's going to fix it.
*  So just don't bother me.
*  Fifty Boeing whistleblowers still want to talk safety fears,
*  despite two informants dying after speaking out.
*  They'll kill 50 of them, too.
*  Don't think they won't.
*  Fifty people can commit suicide if they're wrong.
*  Fifty people can absolutely commit suicide.
*  Especially if they're disparaging a great company like Boeing.
*  What does it say here?
*  John Barnett, 62, quality control engineer,
*  just begun testimony in a lawsuit against Boeing in March
*  when he was found in his truck at a South Carolina motel
*  with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound.
*  Yeah, that's a little fishy.
*  Joshua Dean, 45, died unexpectedly in early May.
*  The quality auditor at Spirit Aero Systems,
*  one of Boeing's biggest suppliers,
*  passed away in the hospital following the onset
*  of a fast-moving infection.
*  Yeah, they can do that to you.
*  Sure. They can do that to you.
*  They can give you an infection. Absolutely.
*  They certainly can shoot you in the head.
*  They can do all of that.
*  Yeah, they can definitely shoot you in the head.
*  And their attitude is like, hey, you know,
*  can you not
*  fuck up our thing?
*  Yeah, we're trying to fix it.
*  We don't need you whistle blowing.
*  We're trying to fix it.
*  You're not helping.
*  Yeah, what are you doing?
*  You're killing yourself?
*  You want attention.
*  Do you think there's a,
*  like James Lindsay has a very interesting take on this.
*  He thinks that China is,
*  they own a competitor to the Boeing planes.
*  And I think the strategy is to destabilize Boeing
*  and have the Chinese planes take over.
*  So they're killing the whistle blowers?
*  No, that there's some sort of a push
*  to get this Chinese jet company to get their products.
*  They're more safe. They're better.
*  Let's just take those.
*  Maybe, but Boeing is so deeply enmeshed
*  in the national security apparatus.
*  I can't see that ever happening.
*  Right.
*  There's no way that we-
*  But if you wanted to do something like that,
*  how would you do it?
*  You would like this.
*  You would fuck with the safety protocols.
*  I mean, we do depend on too much for national security.
*  We do depend on too many things from China already.
*  Oh yeah, like medicine.
*  Like all of that.
*  Like not only medicine, but like chips.
*  What's that thing that, what do they do?
*  Is it reactors or what do they buy?
*  What do we, they basically said,
*  we're not selling you these anymore.
*  Well, they're in charge of so many of the mines.
*  That's right.
*  So many of the mines in the Congo are being run by China.
*  So I don't know if we'd be so stupid
*  to just start buying all of their stuff,
*  but maybe it's a possibility.
*  China's homegrown 737 competitor has to wait a while
*  to fill the vacuum left by Boeing.
*  Europe says the COMA Comac-
*  C19.
*  C19 is too new to approve by 2026.
*  So they have their own version.
*  So if they're playing a long game,
*  what better way to destabilize the competitor than just,
*  listen, we need to save money.
*  Let's cut back on some of these safety inspectors
*  and have the mechanics do their own safety inspection.
*  Absolutely.
*  Done, we're good. Done, we're good.
*  If you just put that little piece in place,
*  if you just did that,
*  and you just take into account people's laziness
*  and how people suck at their job already,
*  and then there's no oversight for the mechanics,
*  what's the possibility that mistakes are gonna be made?
*  100%. Yeah.
*  Well, corporate espionage is probably one of their
*  strongest talents and one of the things they've excelled at.
*  Imagine if that's how they do it though.
*  Lindsey's right.
*  When he said that to me, I was like, Jesus Christ.
*  He might be right.
*  He might be right.
*  I just don't wanna sit in a plane and be fucking nervous.
*  Oh yeah. For no reason.
*  Yeah, but you don't have to ask.
*  I want the Boeing people to shut their fucking mouths,
*  let this thing go down the runway,
*  let me feel like it's okay,
*  and if it happens, it happens.
*  You know what the ultimate conspiracy theory is?
*  Yeah.
*  That Trump has a Boeing plane,
*  and that's why they're doing this.
*  Whoa.
*  I got you with that one.
*  That's something wild.
*  That one got you excited.
*  That is interesting.
*  Imagine that.
*  Imagine that's what they did.
*  What happens if he dies?
*  Imagine that.
*  I don't know.
*  How crazy is it gonna be if he gets whacked?
*  I don't know if they're gonna do that.
*  I think they're gonna try to go to war with China.
*  I think they're gonna go to war or something.
*  I think they're gonna,
*  if they are gonna do anything,
*  I think they just fucking try to do something
*  that either delays an election
*  or makes an election harder to have or something.
*  I don't know, but if they were gonna do something,
*  it might have been, it might be that,
*  and I don't know, and they may do nothing.
*  They may just have a fair election, I don't know.
*  Anyway, I don't know.
*  But this is the question.
*  This is what we were talking about earlier.
*  If they're willing to deceive us with the Steele dossier,
*  they're willing to deceive us with what they did with Bernie
*  and what they did with RFK Junior in the primary,
*  if they're willing to do all that,
*  why would we think that they wouldn't fuck
*  with the election?
*  This is the one thing that they wouldn't fuck with.
*  And then if you question it at all, especially Trump,
*  because nobody really cared
*  when everybody else questioned the elections.
*  Nobody cared when Hillary went around forever
*  questioning the elections.
*  Nobody cared.
*  Everybody has questioned elections in this country
*  for a very long time.
*  Standard move.
*  Bush v. Gore, remember the court case?
*  Remember the, it's kind of a standard move.
*  It's been getting more and more malevolent
*  in the sense that, you know, after Trump won,
*  it was a whole thing with Russia.
*  And then I don't know,
*  I haven't looked at any specific evidence for the fuckery,
*  but I think there's probably fuckery all over the place.
*  There's probably fuckery in every election.
*  There's gotta be some.
*  It's not zero.
*  The amount of election fraud isn't zero.
*  This one, they have to do something big.
*  This one will have to be, if something's gonna happen,
*  it's probably gonna have to be something big.
*  They're gonna have to wag the dog on such a, you know,
*  in such a way that America's like, whoa.
*  And they're already, there's some articles coming out
*  being like, you know, could a foreign government
*  perhaps take advantage of, you know?
*  So who knows what they're planning?
*  I just know that they don't want him in
*  in a way that I've never seen.
*  Never.
*  Never.
*  It's never been more transparent.
*  It's never been more transparent
*  how much they do not want him in.
*  And I'm not even saying that you can't criticize him
*  or you have to love him or anything.
*  I'm just speaking simply, again,
*  from looking at the measures taken
*  since he announced a candidacy.
*  And here's what's really crazy.
*  I think they thought they did enough propaganda-wise
*  before 2016 for him to lose.
*  So when you watch all the news reports
*  and all the coverage, it was like 90% Hillary
*  was gonna win.
*  That's right.
*  And then as the night went on,
*  everybody was like, holy shit, he won.
*  So they went through the egg on their face.
*  They went through all that.
*  They're not gonna let that happen again.
*  And now he's an overwhelming favorite.
*  Yes.
*  Like he's a favorite.
*  If the election happened now
*  and the election was fair, he would win.
*  Right?
*  Yes.
*  Like he's several points ahead of Biden, right?
*  That's right.
*  What's the latest polls?
*  Because he went up in the polls after the conviction.
*  Which was such a mistake for them to try to do that
*  because he raised $40 million, something like that.
*  No, it's way more than that now.
*  Maybe more.
*  I think it's like 100 million.
*  It crashed his campaign website.
*  Yeah.
*  What is that poll?
*  How do they question everybody real quick?
*  Like when some news breaks, what do you think now?
*  Right, who are they questioning?
*  At 6 p.m., how do they get a new update?
*  I always say this.
*  They're only getting results from people
*  dumb enough to answer polls.
*  So that, by the way, is a skewed response.
*  For sure.
*  Polls in today's day and age,
*  there's no reason to answer them.
*  Why are you doing that?
*  But there's also a social stigma to saying Trump.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So I think that you have to weigh the numbers like that.
*  Right.
*  So there is a little bit of a social stigma
*  to saying Trump.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Or certainly there was.
*  Maybe it's going away, but there was.
*  So you might want to weight the poll to that as well.
*  That's 100% true.
*  And go, there's a certain percentage of people
*  that are lying in saying Biden
*  who aren't gonna vote for Biden.
*  Right.
*  So a close race might really mean
*  that Trump is up a few percentage points.
*  I think he's up a few percentage points already.
*  I think he's up like six points.
*  I've talked to a lot of hardcore leftists
*  that are like really resigned to him winning
*  and don't care because they say.
*  Maybe it'll be better for the economy.
*  Well, they said we did not vote for Biden
*  to go to war with Russia through Ukraine.
*  We didn't vote for.
*  Jack up inflation.
*  Jack up inflation.
*  We didn't vote for an unending commitment
*  to whatever Israel wants to do in Gaza.
*  We didn't vote for house prices being higher
*  than they've ever been,
*  interest rates being higher than they've ever been.
*  We didn't vote for any of that.
*  He's done a lot for the environment, Biden, supposedly,
*  but also a lot of people didn't vote for all the taxes
*  that come along with that.
*  What is the new one they're doing?
*  They're going after the guy from the Epoch Times.
*  For embezzlement or something?
*  Epoch Times is more of a hardcore right wing side.
*  Which is hilarious.
*  Epoch Times is hilarious.
*  That is very funny.
*  It's like, this is the end.
*  Welcome to the end.
*  Money laundering.
*  It charges alleged $67 million
*  global money laundering scheme.
*  So what's, see, this is the headline, right?
*  What's the actual story?
*  What's a good place to go?
*  Probably AP is probably the more balanced.
*  Go to AP, just for the fuck of it.
*  All right, what will become of the Epoch Times?
*  Is chief financial officer accused of money laundering?
*  Okay, what is the accusation?
*  What is Epoch Times?
*  Federal prosecutors in New York charged,
*  boy, say that dude's name.
*  Weidong Guan of Secaucus, New Jersey,
*  chief financial officer of the Epoch Times
*  of steering at least $67 million in criminal proceeds,
*  much from fraudulently obtained unemployment
*  insurance benefits to the company,
*  its affiliates, and himself.
*  Guan pleaded not guilty,
*  but was suspended by the Epoch Times,
*  which agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
*  The case falls into question of the future of a company
*  that was a key online supporter of Trump
*  and a spreader of conspiracy theories.
*  So what is the $67 million of unemployment?
*  That's what it's saying?
*  How do they do it?
*  How do they do that?
*  This is all just like, what does it mean for the Epoch Times?
*  But what is like, how did he do it?
*  How would have to come out in the trial?
*  You'd have to wait for the trial.
*  They don't say what they're accusing him of?
*  I think that was, I mean.
*  They're accusing him of stealing money.
*  Stealing money, laundering money, I guess.
*  And that's, you would think.
*  The top executive of Epoch Times.
*  So he's just a guy that worked there.
*  A right-wing media company has been arrested
*  and charged with laundering at least $67 million.
*  So he might have actually done it.
*  And they might just, I mean,
*  they're not trying to close the company, right?
*  He's not the, he's just the chief financial officer.
*  Right.
*  Right, so he might have actually done it.
*  I don't know.
*  Chief financial officer was arrested Monday
*  in the indictment, headed up on May 23rd,
*  he entered a plea of not guilty as lawyer,
*  federal public defender.
*  Why does he have a public defender?
*  I guess he lost all his money.
*  Is that?
*  That seems crazy.
*  Is that how it works?
*  That seems crazy.
*  Declined to comment, if convicted,
*  Mr. Guan faces a maximum sentence of 20 years
*  for the money laundering charge
*  and 30 years for each bank fraud.
*  Oh, jeez, he's fucked.
*  Epoch Times affiliated with Falun Gong,
*  a spiritual movement banned in China
*  and was for years an obscure free print newspaper
*  dedicated largely to criticizing
*  the Chinese Communist Party.
*  In recent years, the outlet transformed itself
*  into a prominent supporter of Donald J. Trump
*  and his allies on the right.
*  Oh, they're probably grifting.
*  It's probably a grift.
*  They're trying to make a couple of bucks.
*  It's a grifty company.
*  Yeah.
*  According to prosecutors, Mr. Guan ran a sprawling
*  transnational scheme over four years
*  to buy prepaid debit cards on the internet
*  at a discount using cryptocurrency
*  and then deposit the card's money
*  into both personal and company accounts.
*  The debit cards were loaded with illegally obtained funds,
*  prosecutors said, some of which was fraudulently obtained
*  unemployment insurance benefits.
*  Oh, wow, this seems deep.
*  Whoo.
*  But I mean.
*  Falun Gong.
*  But hold please, because if you're a fucking,
*  the type of dude who has a website
*  that's basically dedicated to criticizing
*  the Chinese Communist Party,
*  and then all of a sudden you flip
*  and become a pro-Trump supporter,
*  that sounds to me like one of those fucking
*  Facebook pages that Russia takes over.
*  Yes.
*  Like they take like a Christian,
*  they used to have a memes page.
*  And then it's a Black Lives Matter page.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it becomes a trans rights page.
*  Yeah, they're just,
*  there's a ton of those folks out there grifting.
*  If one of those guys was also involved
*  in illegal money laundering scheme.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that seems like.
*  Go and sow some chaos.
*  That's probably what they do.
*  Go sow some chaos.
*  It's a great job.
*  I'd like to do it in China for us.
*  I mean, if they're hiring these,
*  why can't America, let's get an army of lunatics,
*  people like me, send me into China,
*  I'll start a problem.
*  They'd kill me quickly.
*  Yeah, you couldn't do it there.
*  That's why we did, we lacked the advantages
*  because you could come here and really start some shit.
*  Do you think that our government is doing that here too?
*  I think elements of it probably are for sure.
*  They have to be.
*  They have to be.
*  They must be.
*  If China is doing that,
*  and we know that Russia's doing that,
*  if we know that they're doing that.
*  Well then what would Navalny have been?
*  Let's think about this, right?
*  Now Navalny might be, he might be
*  a great Russian patriot who was discussable,
*  Vladimir Putin, I do know he started his career
*  with very different views than the views
*  he began espousing after.
*  He seems like a guy that the CIA has a conversation with
*  and then becomes a prominent,
*  I'm not saying that it's possible.
*  But so we're doing things like that probably,
*  and then they're doing things to us where they're like
*  making my aunt kind of more racist.
*  They're starting with a pretty racist person,
*  but they're twisting her and they're getting her more racist.
*  With memes.
*  With memes and with all kinds of crap.
*  Things they share that might not even be true.
*  Yeah, she's like a Long Island,
*  because these Long Island boomers now,
*  they're just with throwing stuff at them
*  and they're just catching it with their teeth,
*  they're like a dog.
*  They share it to their aunt on Facebook.
*  And they just share it and they don't know what's going on
*  and they're just kind of like, it's all,
*  you know, it's all not, my mom's,
*  my friend's mother thinks McDonald's is serving human meat.
*  So that's where we are, you know,
*  a certain percentage of the population is schizophrenic
*  because they can't handle all the stuff
*  we talked about here.
*  It's hard for people to realize how corrupt things are,
*  but how they've always been.
*  So if you learn all of this in an hour, your mind melts.
*  And then you start going, is Chrissy Teigen a vampire?
*  Because every other, it's like up is down
*  and black is white.
*  Yeah, yeah, there's too much information.
*  It's too much information, but if you know about JFK
*  or RFK or Martin Luther King or Quintelper or anything,
*  you have the context to put a lot of this stuff in.
*  So you're not like, oh, your mind doesn't melt immediately.
*  It melts slowly.
*  Real slow.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you have, if you just can keep people fighting
*  about everything and everything being something
*  that they have to uncover and all this chaos,
*  you can get a lot done behind the scenes.
*  You need to.
*  You have to have people completely scattered, have no.
*  Yeah, you can't have people like calm.
*  No.
*  And everybody fine and paying attention to what you're doing.
*  And then you gotta bless it.
*  You gotta go every now and then you gotta go,
*  you know, and then there's like an NFT party
*  everybody has like a time when the crypto is killing it
*  and everybody gets a little money.
*  And then they go, okay, well, we gotta clamp down on this.
*  Right.
*  And then the internet's free and then like,
*  man, let's clamp down on this.
*  And it's just, they oscillate between clamping down
*  on things and then letting people run with them
*  for a little bit.
*  God damn it.
*  Yeah, it's a delicate balance.
*  You imagine being in charge of chaos.
*  Is it, you think there's a guy that's like
*  runs a chaos department in the deep state?
*  Well, I think there's many guys that do and ladies.
*  And do you think that they-
*  Let's not forget them.
*  What is their view of the world?
*  If they're the ones that are instigating all this chaos
*  and they're the ones that are fueling it online,
*  if they're working to actively do that
*  and comment on things on Twitter and get things crazy,
*  what is their view of the world?
*  Like they must be so cynical.
*  I think the only view those people have ever had
*  is the alternative is worse.
*  Right.
*  If we don't do this, Trump gets an office.
*  I think that's the only view they've had.
*  I think when they were doing MKUltra on people,
*  I think they were going the alternative is worse.
*  It's worse.
*  And you can justify a lot of things.
*  When they were carpet bombing Vietnam,
*  it's the alternative is worse.
*  I think that's kind of the only view
*  that those guys can have in that echelon
*  of the national security apparatus.
*  They can't, I don't think they're analyzing it too much
*  outside of that.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  This does not leave me feeling good, Tim.
*  Well-
*  I was hoping to be more-
*  Well, we're gonna tell jokes tonight.
*  Tonight should be fun.
*  So it's fun to tell jokes.
*  Are you splitting your time?
*  You're all over the place now?
*  I'm all over the place.
*  I spend most of my time in the French protectorate,
*  Monaco, where I find honest people.
*  It's so good to have honest people around you.
*  I'm very susceptible to environments.
*  A lot of people that live on boats over there.
*  No, no, no.
*  I'm all over the place.
*  You mean Sam Talent, we're just in Europe
*  for like three weeks.
*  It was amazing.
*  I'm here.
*  Sam was just here.
*  I'm gonna spend a lot of time here, I think,
*  in the summer and fall, because now I'm off the road.
*  So it's like, I'm gonna be here.
*  I'll be popping in LA a little bit.
*  Nice.
*  I'll be around.
*  We're doing something cool with Netflix.
*  We can't say it.
*  It's not a stand-up special.
*  It's something cool.
*  It's like an election type special thing.
*  Oh, that's exciting.
*  Yeah, it'll be fun and I'm excited about that.
*  And it's just fun to do fun stuff.
*  And who knows?
*  We don't know.
*  It's fun.
*  It could all work out.
*  It could all work out.
*  It probably will all work out.
*  That's right.
*  I look back on, there's an Assyrian tablet, I think,
*  fucking 4,000 years ago or something like that.
*  I'm pretty sure I saved it,
*  where they were talking about the end of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I saved it.
*  It's just one of those things.
*  It's like human beings always have that feeling
*  that it's all falling apart.
*  They always have that feeling
*  that at a certain point in time,
*  all of our luck's gonna run out.
*  And it has.
*  That's the other thing.
*  That's the other thing.
*  Like it actually at one point in time.
*  Eddie Pepitone joke where he goes,
*  every generation thinks theirs is the one
*  where the world ends.
*  He goes, but we are right.
*  Here it is.
*  Assyrian clay tablet dating to around 2,800 BC
*  bears the inscription,
*  our earth is degenerative in these later days.
*  There are signs that the world is speedily coming to an end.
*  Bribery and corruption are common.
*  Children no longer obey their parents.
*  Every man wants to write a book.
*  What happened?
*  I was trying to get the quote cut off.
*  But I had it right there.
*  And the end of the world is evidently approaching.
*  That's amazing.
*  So this is a good way to end this.
*  To just explain to people.
*  This fear that we have had is just,
*  we are in a constant state of change
*  and a constant battle of truth and propaganda.
*  And it's always been that way.
*  And that this tablet from 4,800 years ago.
*  And it'll always be that way.
*  It's always gonna be that way.
*  It's always gonna be that way.
*  We're monkeys.
*  We're crazy monkeys.
*  So find something fun out there to do.
*  Yeah, like come to the mothership if you can.
*  And come to the mothership.
*  And not this weekend, it's sold out.
*  Are you here this weekend?
*  I'm here this weekend.
*  Oh shit, nice.
*  I'm here this weekend.
*  Nice.
*  I am here baby, I'm in.
*  Well that's exciting.
*  So we're gonna do Falun Gong.
*  Yeah.
*  Chinese spiritual warfare.
*  If you like Chinese spiritual warfare,
*  these shows will be for you.
*  The text message I'm gonna be sending you
*  in the future gonna be green.
*  Oh, you're going to.
*  Yeah, I'm trying to switch over.
*  You're going to Android?
*  I'm gonna see what that.
*  I don't like being trapped.
*  I felt like I was trapped.
*  I got anxiety about switching.
*  I don't like it either.
*  I get anxiety about switching.
*  When I see that.
*  How crazy is that?
*  When that green text message comes in,
*  it's gonna be so weird though.
*  But it is weird.
*  The whole thing, it's weird that we're so trapped
*  in this wonderful Apple bubble.
*  They do a great job.
*  Make a great phone.
*  It's a great phone.
*  Everything works great.
*  It's great.
*  I love the way you can send videos
*  and airdrop people and FaceTime people.
*  I love it.
*  But I also don't like.
*  You gotta have the new charger all the time.
*  Well no, not anymore.
*  Now it's USB-C.
*  Everything is USB-C.
*  Because Europe is actually forcing Apple to comply.
*  All of these social media sites,
*  or whatever it is, Apple's not social media,
*  but all these tech companies,
*  they have downsides.
*  And then they have things that are really good.
*  Facebook had things that were really good,
*  but they also sell maids in the Philippines.
*  I was watching, there was an Instagram page
*  that was all dedicated to finding people in prison
*  that you could date when they get out.
*  Thank God.
*  Thank God.
*  I was looking at it, it's like how many people
*  who are just like Captain Saboho
*  are just at home looking at these people going,
*  when she gets out.
*  It's a redeemable country.
*  Meet an inmate.
*  Lonely inmates in the US seek pen pals.
*  I just typed in hot single inmates.
*  I put up that.
*  I've seen a few videos of this going around
*  where they're making a singles video.
*  There's gotta be guys and gals
*  that are interested in that.
*  That's their thing.
*  You gotta love a prisoner.
*  Get someone right.
*  Look, they don't have nowhere to stay.
*  They can stay with me.
*  Hot prison pals?
*  Yeah, meet a hot prison pal.
*  You'll be glad you did, exclamation point.
*  Well, if you wanna meet people that have been in jail,
*  come to one of my shows.
*  And there's a very good chance.
*  It's a high likelihood.
*  You'll meet them.
*  Yeah, high likelihood.
*  All right, let's wrap this bitch up.
*  You're the best, thank you.
*  You're the best, you're the best.
*  Appreciate you.
*  I'm gonna come see you this weekend, I'm excited.
*  I hope so.
*  I wanna see your set.
*  Thank you, buddy.
*  Tell everybody.
*  Don't tell me which night, I'll be nervous.
*  Okay, I won't.
*  Okay, I'm kidding.
*  Tell, it's just Tim J. Dillon.
*  It's Tim Dillon. Tim J. Dillon, right?
*  Yeah, on Instagram.
*  Tim J. Dillon on Instagram and X,
*  and then the Tim Dillon Show, if you like, podcasts.
*  Yes.
*  Where people yell.
*  It's the best.
*  You're the best ranter on earth.
*  Wow, that's very sweet of you.
*  Your show, you by yourself talking about things is
*  one of the great joys in life.
*  Thank you so much.
*  My pleasure.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  All right, bye everybody.
*  Bye bye.
*  Bye bye.
