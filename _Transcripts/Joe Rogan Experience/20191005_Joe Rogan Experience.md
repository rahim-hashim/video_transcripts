# Joe Rogan Experience #1361 - Cmdr. David Fravor & Jeremy Corbell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eco2s3-0zsQ)
*  And here we go. First of all, gentlemen, thanks for being here. Jeremy, thanks for coming back
*  again. Thanks, Joe. And thanks to you, sir. It's very exciting to be here. Very exciting for me to
*  be here to be able to talk to you about your story. Thank you. I'm glad to be here. David,
*  tell everybody who you are and tell everybody your background, please. Okay. And my name is David
*  Fravor. I served 24 years in the military, enlisted Marine for a couple years. They sent
*  me to Naval Academy. Then I flew for 18 years for the Navy. Had literally flew A6s, Hornets,
*  and then Super Hornets. Had every qualification you could get in the airplane, everything, even
*  the stuff they're not doing anymore. So I had NVG, high, low, went to Top Gun. And at the time of the
*  incident, we're going to talk about I was a commanding officer of VFA 41, the Black Aces.
*  I've gone through a journey with this whole UFO stuff, from being a full-on true believer to
*  being incredibly skeptical to trying to be open-minded to being more of a believer now
*  than I think I've ever been before. And one of the things that I've always said is the people
*  that I believe that there's a lot of loony people out there, but the people that I put my trust in
*  are high-level military people like yourself. So when I hear someone like you, who has a story
*  that defies logic or defies conventional understanding of how aircrafts work,
*  that's when I sit back and I go, okay, this is a different thing. Because there's always people
*  that are telling you they're psychic or they sense things or they're in communication with Bigfoot.
*  There's always loony people out there. But when someone is in the military, someone is trained to
*  fly these incredible, I mean, how expensive are those jets? When we had about $70 million a piece.
*  Yeah, they don't give those to morons. Typically not. Some people in my family would probably
*  argue that point, but better lucky than good. It just seems to me that this is for rational people
*  that want to look at this whole UFO phenomenon objectively. You're the type of person that I
*  want to talk to. So I was very excited to have you in here. So what year was your incident? And you
*  have a very, very famous incident that's corroborated by actual evidence, which is one of the rare ones.
*  What year was it and where did it take place? So it was 2004, November 14th.
*  If you draw San Diego to Ensenada, Mexico, we're about 60 miles off the coast in between the two.
*  We're doing workups. So when we get ready to deploy, this was for the 2005 deployment.
*  We were going at sea for November and December of 2004. So we had been out, I had just taken over
*  the squadron mid-October. So I had been the CO for a month. So we go out and we're putting the
*  battle group pieces together. So it's not just the air wing, but we're on the carrier. We've
*  got the cruiser. We've got all the support ships out there and we're going to integrate all the
*  defenses and train as one unit. So the exercise that we're going to do is an air defense exercise
*  where there's good guys, bad guys. They're all from internal from the air wing. So the bad guys
*  today are going to be the Marines, VMFA 232, the Red Devils. So they're going to launch and they're
*  going to go about a hundred miles south of the ship and we're the good guys and it's, we call it
*  2v2. So it's two of us against two of them. We're going to work with the USS Princeton, which is
*  going to be the controller and they're going to control the blue forces and then the red guys are
*  going to give us a presentation that, you know, they're going to train intercepts so we can stop
*  them from getting up towards a carrier. So that's kind of the training set that we're all good.
*  So the Marines take off first and they start heading to the south. Now we have no idea that
*  for two weeks, the two weeks we've been at sea, they've been tracking these things coming out
*  of the sky. And when I talked to the Princeton controller, he's like up to about a dozen of them.
*  They would come down from above 80,000 feet. They dropped down to about 20,000 feet. They'd
*  hang out and then they'd go straight back up after about three or four hours. Now when you say they
*  had been tracking them, who specifically? This is the USS, the Princeton was tracking them. They saw
*  them on the Nimitz radar and the E2 could see them. So, cause they're out there, you know, that radar
*  is on all the time and the SPY-1 system on an Aegis cruiser is, you know, the state that's probably
*  one of the most sophisticated systems in the world. So typically when something like this happens and
*  there is some unexplained phenomenon, what do they do? In this case, you know, if we were in a
*  threat environment, they would tell us, but they're off the coast of San Diego, it doesn't come to the
*  airwings. We have no idea that these things are out there at all. So they observe these things
*  and they never bother telling any of you guys. That's correct. So they just knew that these things
*  had been visiting this area, but they just allowed this training exercise to take place anyway. Yeah,
*  talking to them, the previous, for the two weeks they would show up, but it was when we weren't
*  flying. So the typical carrier schedule is, you know, for us, it was about noon to midnight.
*  It's a 12 hour day. There's reasons for that. It can go a lot longer than it can, but for training,
*  we just do the 12 hour day thing. And it's cyclic ops. So you got guys taking off and landing
*  periodically. So we were on one of the first goes, you know, it's, you know, noon, one o'clock,
*  somewhere on there. And we take off, the Marines take off first. And my buddy Cheeks, who's the CEO
*  of the Marine Squadron, was one, he was leading the red air. They had, when he launched off the
*  carrier first, they called him up and said, Hey, what do you got on board? Well, the small, the
*  original legacy F-18s don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets. Super Hornets, about 30% bigger.
*  So they start talking to him about fuel and based on how long we're going to be airborne and
*  everything else, they go, Hey, why don't you just go ahead and proceed to your, your cap point?
*  Because we had just taken off. And that's when the controller had come up and said, Hey, yeah,
*  I forget our costs. It's probably like dealer is usually what we went. So that'd be like dealer
*  111. This is Prince control. What do you got? You know, say your loadout. I kind of chuckled. He said,
*  I saw I got a cadom nine, which is a, it's a basically just a blue metal tube with a seeker
*  head for an A9 IR missile. It's a training. It doesn't come off the airplane. You can beat it
*  with a sledgehammer. That's the only way you're going to get it off or you got to unlock the lugs
*  with a key. So I'm like kind of chuckling. He goes, well, Hey, we're going to cancel the training.
*  So we're like, okay. He says, we got real world vector and they're going to send us out to the
*  west. So picture if it's a, you know, if you've got a clock, the Nimitz is in the middle.
*  We're a little bit south of that, about 40 miles south. And then the Marines are about a hundred
*  miles south of the ship, about 60 miles between the two of us. So as this is all happening,
*  my wingman is joining up and these are F18F. So there's two people in each jet. So it's me and
*  my WIZO, which is weapon systems operator. And I've got the other pilot and the weapon systems
*  operator and the other jet. So they tell us all this, Hey, we're going to real world vector. And
*  they send us out to seven zero, about 60 miles away from where we're going. So now we're going
*  out even further out to sea. We have no idea what we're intercepting. And this is when the
*  controller starts talking to us. He says, Hey, sir, we've seen these objects. They've been
*  for two weeks. They've been coming down and he's given us the whole story. He says,
*  we need you to go investigate. We want to know what these are, but they're asking you to investigate
*  in a jet that's unarmed. That's correct. Okay. Yeah. We have no, and there's reasons for that
*  that we don't fly. We typically don't fly with live ordinance unless we're actually going into
*  a combat zone or we're on a training range and we're going to shoot something. And the reason is
*  you can go through history of the Navy or Air Force. If you put live missiles on airplanes and
*  then you start doing training where you're squeezing the trigger, someone always messes
*  the switchology up and someone gets shot down. It's happened multiple times. So we don't do it.
*  There's times that we do, but it's rare. So we start flying out to the West. Now I want you to
*  think, because the other pilot has a, when you talk to, it's out there, it was a female. When
*  you talk to her, it's, here's the kind of goes through the mindset of,
*  Hey, we're off the coast of Mexico, real world vector. We have no idea what we're going to look at.
*  Probably drug runner, because you get the drug runners coming up the coast. So we're like, okay.
*  So we drive out and they're calling down ranges. So they're telling us, Hey, it's
*  two seven zero at 30 miles at 20,000 feet. And it's, you know, and then you just count down the
*  ranges and we're talking back and forth the whole time. So they got to a point where they say, Hey,
*  merge plot, which means radars have resolution cells, you know, range and as myth of what the
*  radar can actually see. Once you're inside that box, you can't tell the difference between me
*  and the object I'm going at. We're just become one big blob. So they call merge plot. And so the other
*  jet is on my left-hand side. And we're going to, I'm going to go to a clock code to make it simple. So
*  the object we're going to end up looking for is right in the middle of the clock. And we are at
*  the six o'clock position and my wingman is off to my left side. So it's, she's further down with
*  her with. So as we're looking around, we, we look to the right and there's a, it was pretty, yesterday
*  was a perfect example out here. The water is perfectly calm, no white caps. I mean, it's
*  literally a perfect San Diego, California day. And we see white water, something like if you see a
*  seamount, you know, rock underwater, when you're standing on the shore and the waves are breaking
*  over and you're like, what is that? It's usually cause there's a rock under the water.
*  So it looks like that, but it's about the size of a 737. It actually kind of has a shape of like a
*  cross and it's pointing to the east. So you've got the long part going east, west, and you got
*  a couple of things going north and south. So as we're looking at it, cause that kind of draws our
*  eyes, we're like, well, that's kind of odd. We look down and the, the whizzo and the other airplane
*  comes up and says, Hey skipper, do you, and that's about what he gets out of his mouth. And I'm kind
*  of looking at the same thing. I go, dude, do you see that? What is that thing? And what we see is
*  this white tic tac looking object just above the surface of the water pointing north south. And it's
*  going north, south, east, west. It's just radically moving forward, back, left, right at will. And
*  it's moving around the disturbance, the white water that we see. How big is this thing?
*  Over time, it's about 40 feet long. And the way I estimate that is, I mean, I got a lot of time
*  fighting other airplanes, so it's about about the size of a hornet fuselage. So that's what you say,
*  40 feet. This thing's just going left. So the first thing you see when you look down, you go,
*  and this is with our eyes, it's not sensors, right? So we're looking down at this thing. And
*  first thing you think is helicopter, right? They're, they, the helicopters typically stay
*  below 200 feet when we're out there and they're just driving around. We're pretty far away from
*  the ship for a helicopter for one of ours. So what is it? So the first thing you look for is
*  rotor wash. You know, if you've watched any TV show that starts kicking the water up and you can
*  see that it's really easy to see from the air. So we're like, no, no rotor wash. Matter of fact,
*  don't see any rotors, don't see any tail rotor, don't see any, you know, the main rotors are
*  kind of weird. So as we're driving around, we're looking at this thing. We get to about the nine
*  o'clock position. How far away are you from this thing? I'm at 20,000 feet and it's right down on
*  the surface, right off our right side. So I'm probably maybe a couple miles lateral and 20,000
*  feet. And we're just watching it move around. And so it's very small in your eyes. Not overly
*  small. I mean, an airplane down that low, it's 40 feet. You can see pretty well with it was pretty
*  clear. So I'm like, okay. So I said, I'm gonna go check it out. That's what we're trained to do.
*  The other pilot says, Hey, I'm gonna stay up here. And I'm like, that's perfect. So now we'll get
*  some separation. We'll get it from different views. And the other airplane, well, I kind of
*  have a God's eye view of everything that's going on as I go down and check this thing out. So I
*  start driving around and it's still doing its forward, back, left, right. It's still pointing
*  north south. We get to about the 12 o'clock position. I'm just in a nice, easy descent.
*  The reason, you know, because I've been asked, how can you go more aggressive? You can, but when
*  you're out over water, the water looks the same at 20,000 feet as it does at 2000 feet. You don't,
*  you know, so you can easily put yourself in a non-recoverable position if you're not paying
*  attention and you go into the water. So I got this nice, easy descent. I get to about 12 o'clock. And
*  as I'm coming down, you know, I could guess probably about, you know, 18,000 feet now,
*  a couple thousand feet below the other airplane. The Tic Tac just kind of rapidly goes boop and
*  turns. So now it's kind of pointing east west and now it mirrors us. So it's above the surface.
*  We're up high, we're coming down, it starts coming up. Well, this is getting interesting.
*  So we kind of drive all the way around a circle. I'm descending, it's coming up, and I get over to
*  about the eight o'clock position on the clock. And it's over at about the two o'clock position.
*  Well, the quickest way, as we know, as kids, to get someone, you know, you can keep going around
*  the circle, nothing's going to happen. You cut across the circle. So I'm about, I don't know,
*  probably two to 3000 feet above it. And I just kind of drop my nose aggressively and I cut across
*  the circle and it's coming this way. It's because I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be,
*  because I want to join on it. I want to see how close I can get to it. And as I'm pulling up,
*  it's kind of starting to cross my nose and it starts to accelerate. And within about
*  less than a second, as I start to pull nose onto it and it crosses right in front of me,
*  it just goes poof and it's gone. So I call the other airplane, I said, hey, do you guys,
*  do you guys see that thing? And they're like, sir, it's gone. We don't see it at all.
*  So I'm like, okay, that's kind of weird. So we don't see it, we're looking at the same time. I
*  say, hey, let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water. You know, there's,
*  was there something there? So we turn around, we're right there. We haven't gone anywhere.
*  It's gone. Water's perfectly, there's no white water, nothing. It's just blue.
*  I'm like, okay. So we turned background, now we're heading back out towards the east.
*  And I tell the controller, I said, well, I said, you know, I first said, I'm kind of weirded out.
*  And I told my back seat or that we start heading back and the controller on the Princeton comes up
*  and he says, sir, you're not going to believe this, but that thing is back at your cap point.
*  That was our original point where we were going to hold 40 miles south of the ship.
*  So this thing has went from wherever we were at to, you know, about 60 miles in, you know,
*  maybe 30, 40 seconds, it's already over there. And it just, and they didn't track it. It just
*  appeared. He just shows back up on the radar and they go, it's here. So we're like, okay.
*  So we fly back. We don't see it. We don't see it on our radar. We don't see it on any of our
*  sensors. We do like two runs and we come back to the ship and land. So as we're in our, it's,
*  we call it the PR shop. We're taking off our flight gear. One of my crews is getting ready to go out.
*  And I think they were going to be on a tanker mission, but they had a targeting pod on board.
*  So they launch off and we're telling them about this before. And I, and the back seater, Chad says,
*  he's really determined he's going to find this thing. So he tells the pilot, hey, we're going to
*  find this thing. So there's out driving around and in the back seat of a super Hornet,
*  there's no stick, but there's side stick controllers and they're to control the sensors
*  because that's what the weapon systems guys do. And they can change displays really fast by just
*  hitting a button and it'll flip from the radar to the targeting pod. And the way the system actually
*  works is when you see something on the radar and you designate it as your primary target,
*  all the other sensors will look at that point. So it's, everything is kind of synced together.
*  So he picks up a hit on his radar and he goes to lock it up. Cause I watched all the tapes,
*  he goes to lock it up and immediately the radar can tell it gets signals back that it's being
*  jammed. So, and technically jamming is an act of war. It starts jamming the radar, goes into a jam,
*  extrapolate a bunch of stuff happens on the scope. Well, he's smart enough to castle to his targeting
*  pod and he takes a passive track. And that's the video that you see of the Tic Tac where it's just
*  sitting in the middle of the screen real quiet. So he does that and he goes through, if you watched
*  the video, if we had it, I'd go through it with you, but they go through all the different modes.
*  So he goes, it's an IR and an EO, EO is TV. It's black and white TV camera. We do, we can get the
*  video right online. Let's get the video, Jamie, where would you, you can't show it to anybody.
*  We can't, we can't show it on YouTube, but you can see it and people will be able to go to it.
*  You know what we'll do? Go to the video and we'll tell people when we're starting and we'll tell
*  people what the title of the video that you get to is and they can sync it up themselves if they're
*  watching it. It's publicly owned. It's publicly owned. It's, you know, American government.
*  Right. So it is actually something in the public domain. So you think we could play it on YouTube
*  and not get polled? Yeah. A hundred percent. You think so, Jamie? It's a government. Those things,
*  I would say yes, we should be able to, but sometimes those things get messy. So let's take a
*  chance with this one. I know if you go, if you're on a New York Times article, there's a link to it.
*  It's a Pentagon release. YouTube is crazy with copyright stuff and we've always been like two
*  steps away from getting polled off of YouTube completely. It's a real disaster. It's, I understand
*  from their perspective, there's a lot of legal issues they have to deal with, but I have it on
*  a private server. I could maybe send Jamie. The issue I believe though is the actual copyright of
*  the video itself. Oh, it's just, it's a Pentagon release. Pentagon release, public domain. And the
*  Pentagon is going to come after us. I don't think so. I don't think so either. Do you find it?
*  I want to find a good version of the video that doesn't have somebody else's copyright. Jeremy,
*  do you know? Yeah, I've got an un-Watermarked version. Let me just look it up.
*  Jeremy will get it to us. I have to figure out how to send it to you right here. Give me a second.
*  Do you have a air drop? Could you air drop it? Yeah, but I got it on a page, a private page
*  that can send Jamie. Oh yeah, okay. Okay. Do you have Jamie's info? No. Okay. I'll figure it out.
*  Send it to me and I'll send it to him. Okay. That's pretty easy. Sorry to disrupt the momentum. No,
*  but I think this, it's probably important to be able to have this, the video itself so you
*  could just talk about it. And we're about to yank it up here. Okay. Jamie wrote it down for you.
*  Give me a second to get it out. Okay. And for people who don't know, Jeremy also produced
*  Bob Lazar, Area 51 in Flying Saucers. And he was in here when we had Bob Lazar in, talk about
*  Bob's experience. And Jesus, if that wasn't a game changer for me and for a lot of other people,
*  this is a subject that it's so easy to mock. You know, this is why I think it's so important
*  that we talk to people like you because like I said, just your average everyday UFO crackpot,
*  they believe everything in anything. Have you ever had any UFO experiences before this?
*  No, the irony, and I tell this story, my mother-in-law, she'll be listening. She literally,
*  every time I would go home, she would ask me, Hey, did you see UFO? Did you see a few? And I'd be
*  like, no. When I first started dating my wife, she was a big like national inquirer. She had all the
*  supermarket tabloids. And I would always just feed her crap for it. So this happens and, you know,
*  and I never say a word. So my friends all knew it was a great story over beers because they'd go,
*  Hey, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying? I go, I chased a UFO. And they go, get out of here.
*  I go, no, seriously. And I tell them the story. And they're like, dude. I go, yeah. So I go home
*  and I got asked by Lou Elizondo to do the New York Times article, which is like anything else. I
*  always say no. Like it took a bunch of times to get me on your show. Jeremy kept asking, asking,
*  asking. And it was- Thank you, Jeremy. You gotta thank my contractor's wife, Angel, who we were
*  at a party drinking and she goes, you gotta do Rogan. I go, what? She goes, it's the biggest
*  podcast on the planet. She goes, you gotta do it. And I go, all right, I'm going to do it just for
*  you. I'm going to do this show. Shout out to Angel. Yeah. From New Hampshire. So my mother-in-law,
*  we're sitting there and I know the New York Times article is going to come out. And so it was at
*  Thanksgiving in 20, when the article came out, 17. So it was Thanksgiving in 2017. And everyone had
*  kind of left the house. So it's just my wife and my in-laws, a couple of us sitting in the kitchen.
*  And I said, hey, I gotta tell you guys this. They said what? I said, there's going to be this article
*  comes out in the New York Times and I'm in it. And they're like, yeah. I go, well, I chased a UFO.
*  My mother-in-law's like, ha ha. She looks at my father-in-law. He's rolling his eyes looking at
*  me like, are you serious? And I go, yeah. And then she's like, you never told us. I go, I never
*  really told anyone. I mean, my wife and kids knew the event happened, but they didn't have all the
*  details because it's just one of those things I just didn't get into. Is it classified? No. Was
*  it at any point in time? No, there's a lot of rumors out there that I was classified and the ship got
*  locked down. No, it wasn't. Men in suits did not show up. No one told us not to talk about it.
*  And this is because there's a lot of other people saying other things. And I said,
*  let's look at it. Here's the context. So in the battle group, you've got the admiral, you got the
*  captain of the ship, the captain of the Princeton, and then you've got the other COs. So in position
*  wise, I'm probably as a CO of a squadron in the top 20 out of 6,000. And no one came to talk to me.
*  No one came to take my tapes. No one showed up in a suit. No one told me not to talk. No one talked
*  to any of my air crew that were involved in this. There were six people total involved, the two that
*  shot the video and the four of us that looked at it for five minutes with our eyes. No one, nothing.
*  And I can get into how there's a report that George Knapp got released. I call it the unofficial
*  official report. And I had met someone and I'm like, hey, can you find anything out? I had this
*  incident. Normally you tell people this. They look at you like, dude, what are you smoking?
*  I'm like, no, no, I'm good. I'm tested. And they go, and they said, well, let me see what I can do.
*  And I had got a call. I was working, I was doing some aerospace work and I had gotten a call on my
*  cell phone from a guy. And he said, hey, I want to investigate your incident. And I go, okay.
*  So he did. He investigated the incident and it was very, very thorough. I mean, if you've read
*  that it's about 10 pages long and he, I mean, he tracked down everybody. He tracked down all the
*  people that were the aircrew that were involved. He talked to, he tracked down the Admiral. He
*  talked, I mean, he, he, it was a pretty thorough report and I didn't think anything of it, you know,
*  because, you know, the people were that's out there, so they want to do FOIA, but it was never
*  released in a FOIA request. I actually had the Navy call me. I'd been out of the Navy for like
*  six years and let's explain to people. That means freedom of information. So I got called by a public
*  affairs person from the Navy and said, Hey, is this Commander Fray? And I said, yeah. And they
*  said, Hey, do you know of any documentation on your UFO incident off the Nimitz? And I said,
*  official. And she said, yeah. I said, no, because I knew the report existed, but to me it was an
*  unofficial because I didn't know who, where it went. I, and I had a copy of it, but because it
*  wasn't official. Well, then years later, I find out that the guy who actually did the report was
*  part of the ATIP team. And I was talking to Lou Elizondo, who runs that program. And Lou showed
*  me the documentation of the original. I think it's like 13 people that were part of ATIP and
*  they were FOIA exempt. And I'm like, well, that's kind of, well, hey, I know that guy. He's the guy
*  that did the report, which is why it never ever came out until George got his hands on.
*  How does something freedom of information act exempt?
*  Obviously DOD has the ability because I, I'm a, I'm not a conspiracy theory person at all. I mean,
*  I'll just tell you that, you know, and I think there's reasons that the government doesn't tell
*  the public everything. And I don't speak for the government, but I think there's a good reason for
*  that, that not everything needs to go out to the public, but most of it does. And they just, what
*  they do is they put a clause on, Hey, for this program or whatever we're doing, which would have
*  been an ATIP program, the work that they do and what they find is not, it's not releasable through
*  freedom of information act. There's probably other avenues to get that, you know, and then you go,
*  well, what really is freedom of information? Cause I got into this on a, I was talking to someone
*  who's a conspiracy theorist and they said, well, so-and-so wrote and they're not getting any
*  information on your event. I said, so what are they going to do? They're going to call up,
*  you're going to put in your request for freedom of information. You go, here's what I want.
*  It goes to some poor guy at the Pentagon who's like, I have no idea what this is. And he searches
*  around. He doesn't find anything. He looks at his bud and I get in on for you. I go, Hey, Joe,
*  you got anything on the Nimitz incident? And you go, Nope. And I go, okay, well, I didn't find
*  anything. I looked, I did my due diligence, but I'm not going to spend the next six months of my life
*  doing your research project for you. So you get nothing. And then you assume the government's
*  covering up when the government really isn't. They just, you know, the guys are doing the
*  research, doesn't know where it's at or doesn't have access to it. Makes sense. Jamie, we have
*  the video. Okay. Here we go. Now explain what, what is, what are we seeing? Why are we seeing
*  it in this, uh, this particular? Okay. So we'll just kind of go around. And so if you look at the,
*  uh, don't OPR is operate on the top left corner. NAR is narrow field of view, which is zoomed in.
*  Uh, IR at the top middle, it means it's an infrared mode. So instead of seeing color,
*  you're seeing temperature variations. And these things are extremely sensitive to win like tens
*  of degrees. They will tell you the difference to color. So it'll go from black to white. So in this
*  case, white is hot. So if you look down on the bottom left corner, it says WHT, um, that's white.
*  It means white is hot. So the object that you're looking at is hotter than the sky around it.
*  But we also notice is there's no plumes. Now, if you're looking at an airplane,
*  when you get closer, you'll actually see the exhaust coming out and there'll be a
*  really glowing plume. That's important as we, as we look at the video and then the most of the
*  stuff on here, you really don't need to know what you can look at is, uh, the bottom right corner
*  it says 19,990 and a B that's the altitude. And, uh, if you look up in the little words where it
*  says HDG and then BALT, B it's autopilot. So it's on altitude hold. It's just flying, uh, for that.
*  So you can go ahead and play the video. And so those two bars next to the white object,
*  that's a, that's a, that's a passive track. So what he's done is he's commanded the flier to
*  track that. So what the system does is it uses, uh, it's actually tracking. It can track pixels
*  and it's just basically block those hot pixels, those white pixels from the black ones.
*  And you're going to see now, pause it real quick. So I'm at the top seat, went to white screen with
*  the black object. This is a black and white TV mode. And you look at the top says TV. So
*  narrow in TV mode is actually, you can get closer than narrow in IR. It's literally narrow in IR is
*  about medium in TV mode. So there's, you can get closer with the TV mode. So as you look at it now,
*  in this case, you would actually start to see, um, stuff going on. And even in TV mode, because you
*  get exhaust, you know, the black exhaust that comes out, you'll usually be able to see kind of
*  some of that coming out of the back and you don't see anything. This thing's just sitting there.
*  And if you look at the, uh, the top where it says three, right, that's the pod is looking three
*  degrees right at the nose of the airplane. Right? So he's just flying along the bottom numbers.
*  Don't worry. Those are time. So it's 4156. So go ahead and hit play. And what, what he's doing is
*  he's going, Chad's going through all the different modes because he's like, Oh, I got it. And he's
*  going to try and see the best video that you can get. Now there's rumors that this video is like
*  10 minutes long. No, what you're looking at is the entire video. Now notice where it says 99.9.
*  So hit pause real quick. What that means is the, why he's got the pod, the targeting pod,
*  cause that's his primary sensor right now. The radar is still trying to look at this object
*  and trying to range it and the radar can't get ranging on it. So the object is doing something
*  to say, I'm not giving you back because it's just a Doppler radar, just like a police radar is a
*  Doppler. It's trying to get a ranging on you and it can't do it. So when it says 99.9, the radar
*  cannot see this object right now. It's not allowing it to get ranging. And I think that's super
*  important, Dave, the way he explained it to me, active jamming compared to passive jamming. This
*  is a technology that is actively jamming this system rather than something like stealth aircraft,
*  which is the shape and the texture of the, yeah, it's cause everyone thinks stealth is invisible.
*  It's not, it's, it's just, it's a technology to, to basically make it harder for radars to see you,
*  you know, and that's the whole thing. You know, if you look at, uh, you know, airplanes that are
*  nose on, uh, are harder to see than airplanes at the sides. Kind of like think of a barn door. If
*  you're looking at the whole barn door, it's really easy to see if I turn the barn door
*  sideways where it's really thin, it's going to be a lot harder for you to see it. So that's it.
*  That's the easiest, most basic way to look at this. So you keep going, you can play again
*  and you can look to the airplane is still sitting at 20,000 feet. It's doing 250 knots.
*  He's going to go through different modes and try and lock it. And, uh, it's just kind of sitting
*  in all of a sudden as the video goes on, I think it's a minute and a half long, see, it's going to
*  try and reacquire, it re-centers the pod. So it's, it's slowly drifting to the left.
*  The, the hornet is still going the same heading, just kind of hanging out and they're just filming
*  this thing. And then when they get close, it's going to zing off the left-hand side. When you
*  see it on a full, because this, you know, you think digital, you'd be able to get a one-for-one copy,
*  unlike, you know, when you copy your album to a cassette, you know, you lose a little quality.
*  Well, you still do in digital world and there off it goes to the left. And that's pretty fast to
*  leave that field of view on the, when we, we have big monitors that we look at these when they come
*  back. So we're looking at the original tapes. So play the end of that again, please, Jamie.
*  So when it's taking off, how fat, when, when it just sort of like leaves the field of view
*  and takes off to the left, how fast is that going? Uh, I would say pretty fast. It's an estimate.
*  If we had ranging, you know, you could obviously do the triangle and go, Hey,
*  cause we know how big the field of view is, but for something to leave the field of view that fast
*  with the pod, just staring is pretty fast. I mean, it just, it's like out of here.
*  Like nothing that we have.
*  No, cause we can't, I don't care what airplane is. So let's just use the F-22 Raptor. That's
*  probably one of the, it's probably the best airplane in the world right now, performance wise. Um,
*  it can't take off like that, especially if it's a hover. I mean, you're, you're talking something
*  that's just sitting in space in the wind and then it just all of a sudden accelerates airplanes.
*  Don't work that way. And it's not leaving an exhaust plume.
*  No, notice there's none. And when you go back to the IR, even in the IR, you don't see there's
*  IR zoomed in and there's no, you would see a plume if that was an airplane.
*  It's creepy how it takes off.
*  With active jamming, it's intelligently controlled. There's no rotors, there's no plumes,
*  there's no exhaust, there's no tail fin. There's no, uh, tail number. This thing
*  goes from a standstill takes off. It's a propulsion system. We don't have in our
*  inventory and no other nation does. That's how it's understood by the government.
*  Now that that's w w w say if the fastest plane on earth was trying to do that same maneuver,
*  this system would be able to track it.
*  Um, yeah, oh yeah, it would stay with it until it got to the limits of the pod,
*  you know, as far as looking to the left, but, and you know, the radar would see it. I mean,
*  we get, you get close enough, you're going to, you know, we, everything becomes visible
*  because you get burned through with radar and how, how radars actually work.
*  This one is, you know, you tell me, but this was
*  performance beyond, I mean, it's like when we saw it disappear, when it flew in front of my nose,
*  and I'm talking something, I'm within a half mile of it looking at it and it gets in front of me
*  and just disappears. So take, we'll just go to something that everyone knows is fast. Let's
*  just say SR 71 that's doing Mach three, you know, the visibility is 50 miles. So even at 35 miles a
*  minute, I'm going to be able to see this thing turn into a little dot as it goes off into the
*  horizon for probably a minute. The thing that we saw disappeared in a second, just gone.
*  And that's from two different angles. Remember the other airplanes, 8,000 feet above me,
*  because we get close to it at about 12,000 feet. So the other airplanes above me looking down and
*  when it disappeared, I said, do you guys see it? And they said, no, it's gone.
*  It just literally was poof.
*  Now, when you came back, and what do you do with this information? Do you report it? Do you talk
*  to people about it? So the typical process, anytime we fly, everything gets debriefed. So
*  because it was a two seat airplane, usually the junior person in the jet goes down. So
*  I was the boss, so I wasn't going down there. So we have a thing called Civic CVIC, which is the
*  Carrier Intel Center. So they go down, we always take our tapes because we record stuff when we're
*  fighting. They take it down and it's really to exercise the system when we're in training,
*  so that when we actually get over to, in this case, we are going over to the Persian Gulf,
*  anything that we do comes in and gets debriefed and then it all gets sent off. That's how you
*  get the CNN video and all that. So they go down and they debrief and they have to tell, hey, we
*  chase this object, we don't know what it is. And of course, everyone now is going to make jokes
*  because we know we're going to catch shit because that's how the Navy works. And I told them, I
*  said, I remember telling the guy in my backseat, I said, dude, we're going to catch maximum shit
*  for this. And he goes, yes, sir, I'll show you the comics. I have them on my phone. The airplane
*  comes out. So we know it's going to come down. So they debriefed us, both crews go in and of course,
*  everyone at Intel thinks this is hilarious. So the flight, Chad comes in with his tapes, when he
*  lands and here's the thing, VFA 41, haha, guys see any UFOs out there? And he pulls out that tape
*  and drops it on the counter. He goes, yeah, it's on here. So they're like, oh shit. So they copy it,
*  they play it and there's a big, it looks like a rack system. They put the eight million, it gets
*  copied to a hard drive and then they archive it. So you go, okay, so they got this video.
*  And then, you know, the ship, the spreads, you know, if you have a rumor on the ship,
*  5000 people are going to know about it within probably 30 minutes. I mean, it spreads that,
*  it's like a virus. So the whole ship now knows that we chased this. I guarantee the whole
*  Princeton knew this stuff was going on. And it goes all the way up. The Admiral knows about it.
*  The captain of the ship knew about it. And then all the movies, because we have, they play movies
*  for us on the ship and they run like a 12 hour loop. So of course, the movie selection is Men
*  and Black, Men and Black 2, Signs, Independence Day. And we know we're going to be on the
*  airplane comic because there's always a comic. So you do something stupid or like this, then
*  you're going to be on the comic. I'll show you the comics here in a little bit. They're pretty funny.
*  But, you know, so that went on for two days, but, you know, we're in the middle of workups
*  and I got a squadron to run. So it's like, you know, there was, after about the first day and
*  a half, it really died down. And then it was the, there's always that closet people that you don't
*  think that are really like UFO buffs. And, you know, like we had one of the Marines would always
*  come and eat, sit down. Hey, hey, Skipper, can I sit with you? I go, you want to talk about the UFO?
*  He goes, yeah, I just, I can't get it out of my mind. And then we would just sit there and talk
*  about it. You know, and to me it was like, you know, we were just saying, you know, my entire
*  now flying career is defined by five minutes of chasing this white tic tac vice almost 4,000 hours,
*  you know, flying. So now did you encounter anyone else that had a similar experience?
*  I've talked to the guys, a couple of guys from the East coast event, the gimbal video.
*  One of them I talked to daily. He's a pretty good friend of mine. Totally different. Now,
*  keep in mind ours is 2004. The gimbal video is 2015. The funny part about the gimbal video and
*  the East coast stuff that was going on, because that's off the vacate. So off the coast of the
*  United States are they're called warning areas. And all they are is there, if you look on an
*  aviation map, there are these big areas that are blocked off by blue and they say like whiskey 291
*  or whiskey 243. And is the gimbal video available in the same way that that video is available?
*  Yes. Yeah. Okay. Find that Jamie. So, and I was talking to him about it because I actually have
*  a buddy of mine who just retired. He was the, he led the fighter wing on the East coast and I had
*  called him up because we start finding out that these things were so prevalent out off the East
*  coast of the United States. And there's a couple of them. So there's the, we're going to talk.
*  What they started seeing originally was these things. And one of them almost hit,
*  airplane almost hit one of these things, but it looks like a cube inside of a clear beach ball.
*  So they don't know if it's actually like a surrounding or it's, you don't know if it's a
*  force field. And you see kind of in the gimbal video, it's got like an aura around it where ours
*  didn't. I always laugh. I go, ours was a Tic Tac. These are not. That means there's different stuff
*  out there that we don't know. But they had two airplanes flying and we fly when we go out to
*  train, where you usually, we have a distance, you know, we'll just say we're a mile apart
*  as we're flying out. So they're flying out and they're, you know, the airplanes are deployed,
*  we call it combat spread. And one of the airplanes almost hits one of these goes close down like
*  50 feet down the side and almost hits one of these floating cubes inside of the beach ball.
*  And someone goes out, like it's a, it's a balloon. It's not a balloon. I mean, these things are
*  literally sitting still. They're, they're no effect from the wind. So if you got 90 knots of wind and
*  they talk about it, these things are just sitting there. So 60 or 70 people would see it because
*  the radars, the newer radar in the super Hornets is extremely, extremely capable. Okay. And at first,
*  when they started seeing stuff, they were like, ah, it's just like, maybe it's the radar. Just
*  give me a false target. And that radar really doesn't give false targets. And then someone did
*  exactly what Chad did is they threw their targeting flare out there. And all of a sudden,
*  when you see a heat signature, there's a return. There's obviously something out where that blip
*  is at. What is a targeting flare? That's a, we call it the AT flare. It's an advanced targeting
*  flare. It sits on the left side of the airplane and it's a, we launch it like a flare. No, no,
*  it's a, it's a flare forward looking infrared receiver. Oh, so it's when you see the bombs
*  blowing up on TV and it's that looks like a black and white and you see it play. That's the targeting
*  pod. Okay. It's got a laser in it. It's got an IR marker in it. It's, it's a very capable system
*  that syncs up to this, to the Hornets. So everything kind of marries up. So this is the go fast. No,
*  this is go fast. No, it's the other one. It's the one that looks like the, what is that? That's
*  called the go fast. That looks like a tic tac. And that was another one taken off the East coast,
*  but they grab it and it's marked that one. It's going, it's screaming across the ocean at a very
*  high rate of speed. And there's been some debunkers that say, well, it's really not going that fast.
*  It's just the way the airplane is and how the mechanics of the Potter work. And when you talk
*  to the crew, cause it's actually, I could ask my bud, I'm pretty sure it's the same backseater took
*  both of these videos, took the go fast video and took the gimbal video. And my buddy was on the
*  flight with the gimbal video, but they, these things that I, so I called my bud cause I'm like,
*  Hey, how many people are seeing these things? They're like, I got like 60 or 70, 60 or 70,
*  60 or 70 people had seen these things on radar. And I said, well, what are you doing? They said,
*  well, we put out a note tam, which is a notice to airman that just says, Hey, these things are out
*  there. So just be careful cause we don't want you to hit one. Yeah. And, uh, it's kind of like our
*  cause you would ask, you know, who do you tell? Well, everyone knows. Well, what do you do?
*  And I said, well, cause it was all white and it didn't have any markings on it and it didn't have
*  any wings and it didn't have any rotors and it was just outperformed anything that we have.
*  I think if I would have painted China or Russia on the side, is this the gimbal video? Yes. Okay. So
*  it's the same pod in the beginning, chairman, what we're looking at. And when the crew finds it,
*  what you're not seeing, you're seeing the targeting when you hear them start talking,
*  when you listen to the video, you'll hear the guy go, dude, look, they're all over. Look at the SA
*  page. So we have a situational awareness page and when whatever the radar is getting returns on,
*  it'll show up. It's kind of like our God's eye view in the airplane. So the pod can only look
*  at one thing. So he designates that as his primary target. So that's where the pod is there. The
*  radar is still seeing everything else. So what they're actually seeing this video is what you're,
*  when you see the object that he's tracking, when I was talking to one of the other pilots,
*  he said, there's actually, when you see the radar video, there's like a, it almost looks like a
*  formation in front of them, like five smaller ones that are moving in front of it. And then they turn
*  so like a formation, these things turns and starts going the other way. And then they end
*  while they're filming the gimbal video. And that's kind of the comms when you hear, dude,
*  holy cow, look, they're all over. This is a unreported new information that he's actually
*  saying right now. Everybody knows this video. This is the one that they say turns like the
*  Lazar craft, like belly first. However, what he's telling you right now is something that is not
*  public yet. He's telling you that there was a V formation of other objects that the public has
*  yet to see. You're not going to, you're not going to, it's a radar tape, but there were more objects
*  surrounding this is what he's telling you right now, which is fascinating because the world doesn't
*  know that yet. Just so you know, I mean, that's brand new. That's never been reported by New York
*  Times, anybody. Okay. So you can go ahead and play.
*  So the cool thing with this is, you know, when he goes into, so he's in our, our, our, our mode
*  right now, you're still seeing no plume. He's looking 47. So they're actually turning into it.
*  So it's starting to pull it back towards the nose. See how the number at the top is decreasing
*  and it's against the wind. Now he's in TV mode and this thing's going to just start to roll.
*  You can kind of see it's got that or around it. He said they were saying that the,
*  the ones with the squares inside that looked like the beach ball were the same
*  and this thing is just hanging out. So it's on the airplanes in a left-hand turn and it's
*  so now it's right in front. Yeah. It's, it's just rotating.
*  Now this is how Lazar described. Yes. Put that up. Right. Yeah.
*  Lazar described that, that these things would lay flat and then when they would travel,
*  they would turn up on their side and that's, that's how they maneuvered. So this is very similar.
*  Eerily similar to the propulsion system that Lazar talked about. And that's why this video,
*  we're seeing it very differently now, especially with what we know about Lazar, but the idea is
*  that it would fly belly first in high speed mode. So if they have, these are gravity propelled. This
*  is something that's known within the government. They're trying to back engineer it. They're trying
*  to understand it. We know there's a program currently that they said is, is gone. However,
*  it is currently active to study this. These things will turn belly first, the saucer type looking
*  ones. And then that's the high speed mode because they, they focus allegedly, you know, these
*  gravity wave amplifiers. Look, this thing turns mechanically. There again, no typical form of
*  propulsion as an expert is telling you. This is not a glitch. This is seen by multiple radars,
*  multiple people. Commander Fravor was so close to it. This is something that is not aerodynamic
*  and it could move in ways and fashions. When he's underplaying it, when we first talked,
*  the idea of this thing going, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, it's instantaneous acceleration back and
*  forth. There's no slowing down, no turning like a ping pong ball. He said, me our first talk,
*  ping pong ball in a glass. Nothing moves like that with traditional reactionary propulsion.
*  Somebody has technology that we don't have in our inventory at all.
*  Pete So, this is counterintuitive the way it goes from being aerodynamic to being
*  un-aerodynamic when it goes sideways and then flies belly forward.
*  Jared That's correct. It's, well, it's not, it's, you know, if you talk,
*  because I was just talking to the guy the other day and he said the irony with this is these things
*  would be out there for hours. We don't have, you know, a high performance airplane does not have
*  hours worth of gas. I mean, you know, Hornets, if we don't have aerial refueling, you know,
*  and we're actually out doing a mission and fighting and going fast, you know, you're talking
*  hour and a half and you're coming back to land. Some airplanes are even less, you know, based on
*  their size. You know, so like an F-16 doesn't have external fuel tanks, it doesn't have a lot of gas.
*  And the Soviet airplanes are the same way. The MiG-29 does not have a lot of gas. The Su-27,
*  Su-30s have a lot of gas.
*  Pete Because of weight?
*  Jared It's weight, performance, size of the airplane. So, you know, even our intercontinental
*  bombers like B-2, they still take off in the air or fuel. They keep topped off so they can get to
*  range. That's how we extend things. You got something like this that's coming down. You know,
*  just think of the physics. So, just, I'll use my instinct because that's the one I really know the
*  best is you've got an object coming from above 80,000 feet. So, I'll just tell you that 80,000,
*  somewhere around 70,000-80,000 feet is where you can actually start to see the curvature of the
*  Earth. You know, so that's considered space. So, they're coming from above that. They're coming
*  straight down. They stop at around 20,000 feet. They hang out for three hours and then they go
*  straight back up. So, and I know you had Elon on the show. So, SpaceX is really excited because
*  they can launch a rocket and then they can have the booster come back to Earth and actually land
*  on a pad. Very impressive engineering feat. Next to this technology, that's like a Model T
*  next to a Porsche. I mean, it's like, wow, really? That's it? You know, and you got something that
*  can just at will move around. Now, take it to the next level and I know there's a lot of talk about
*  this so Dave's going to go into speculation mode. But when you take a shape like that, so just take
*  the tic-tac shape which is shaped like a submarine. If you're using a propulsion that's non-reactive
*  where you're just manipulating the median that you're in, air, whatever, you can go into the
*  water. So, when you hear all the reports of, hey, we've seen these things since, you know, World War II
*  that would come out of the water and fly, if you have a technology like this, as long as the object
*  is sealed where you're not going to get water inside of it, there's nothing that says you can't do that
*  because all you're doing is you're not, you know, where a jet engine sucks in air and blows it out
*  the back or a propeller actually pushes the water. It's a force. Now you've got something that's
*  actually manipulating the gravity field and it's just moving through a void. Then it doesn't, then
*  air, you could literally in theory fly, go into the ocean, cruise around, pop back up, fly around,
*  go to space. Nothing, you remove the barriers of the normal propulsion that we have today.
*  There's been many instances of sightings off the coast of California of things that plunge into the
*  water or escape from the water and take off into space. So, yeah, with the field propulsion system,
*  as Commander Fravor is describing, as Lazar described, it doesn't matter the medium of space,
*  air or water. There's no resistance, no splash. I mean, this goes back to, you know, Christopher
*  Columbus reported a UFO sighting. He did? Oh yeah. This idea that, so this has been around,
*  anyway, this idea, boom, that you can go through these different mediums.
*  Hold pause for a second. Christopher Columbus had a UFO sighting?
*  Yeah. It's a written account, so it's like-
*  Find that.
*  No video.
*  No video.
*  No video.
*  This is bullshit then.
*  It's bullshit.
*  Well, see, but that's what's so cool. So Commander Fravor's encounter, it's not the most documented,
*  it's not the most dramatic. However, it has had the most impact out of any sighting because of his
*  credibility and the mere fact that the New York Times picked it up with video footage, radar
*  evidence, and somebody who is as credible as Commander Fravor. It has changed the dynamic
*  of the way people, the government responds, new Navy protocols because of Commander Fravor coming
*  forward. There are closed door congressional and Senate briefings. He's been part of them.
*  He's admitted that before. There's a new study about UFOs because of this encounter. It's so much
*  evidence, has so much power to it compared to other ones. So Christopher Columbus, great,
*  cool story. Somebody wrote it down. Who knows if he even wrote it down. We have highly documented
*  cases. This one has changed our culture and that's what's so cool. People are talking about it
*  differently.
*  So here's, this is a good story. This is true. So I was sitting at home and usually when people
*  try and find me, they get my wife's cell phone because it's the first one on the cell phone bill
*  and it's all in my name. So I get, I see this call from California. I'm like, and normally I
*  don't answer them. And it's her phone. I'm like, who's calling my wife? Because that is me. So I
*  answer it and this lady says, hey, is Commander Fravor there? And I go, who's calling? And she
*  goes, well, I'd like to talk to Commander Fravor. I go, who's calling? And she says, hi, I'm a 79
*  year old woman and I would just like to tell him my story. I go, well, you're talking to him.
*  And she goes, I've never in my life told anyone this. She goes, I grew up, my dad was in the Navy.
*  She goes, he was stationed in Rhode Island at first when she was a child. She said we were
*  walking, her and her mom were walking on the beach and they saw these weird lights. So that kind of
*  got her into that, oh, UFOs. She goes, a few years later they had moved to San Francisco.
*  So I imagine Treasure Island, because at her age that would have been, you know, probably in the
*  fifties. Her dad was, she said her dad was working as a Navy liaison to the agency. And he came home
*  one day and he had a telegram in his hand. And she goes, for some reason he let me read it.
*  She's telling me this story. And I said, well, what'd it say? She says it was, it basically said,
*  hey, unidentified objects going in and out of the water and it had a latitude and longitude in it.
*  And he looked at her, she goes, and I'm a child and I always remember this. She says,
*  he looked at me and said, we get these all the time and it's always in the same area.
*  And I go, of course, I go, well, you got the telegram? She goes, of course not. He had to
*  take it back to work. I said, you don't have to remember that latitude longitude. She said, no.
*  She goes, but you seem to be so credible and believable. She goes, I wanted to tell someone
*  the story that I've never told anyone in my life. So that's what you're starting to see is people
*  that, you know, very credible. They're not, you know, they're not, they're not crazy. They're not
*  making stuff up, but they're coming out and going, hey, I've had these experiences. And I've got a
*  lot of that from over the last two years where people just find my email and send me stuff saying,
*  hey, this happened to me or I saw this. And there's some things that are explainable because I got
*  asked to tell this. So, because we're kind of, I have a sick sense of humor at times. So like I
*  said, I had all these quals. So we used to fly, they don't do it right now because it's a little
*  bit dangerous, but we used to fly night vision goggles, low altitude in Hornets. All right.
*  So when you put on night vision goggles, they amplify light like a lot. So you can see a campfire
*  like 50 miles away. So we used to do it. The good spots were down in Lake El Centro, California.
*  There's a range that there's some bombing ranges, but people go camping in the Superstition
*  Mountains, which is kind of north and west of Imperial by, I forget what it is, the Springs.
*  It's real prison, the desert. It'll come to me in a minute. So we would go out at night flying
*  around on goggles and you'd see a campfire and you go, oh, UFO time. And then you get the airplane
*  going about 600 knots and then you pull the power back to idle. So you can't hear it and you get
*  zinging towards the fire. Well, you turn the lights around now because we're in restricted areas. So
*  we can do that. And there's lights on it that you can only see if you're on night vision goggles.
*  So the other airplanes can see us, but no one else can see us. Then you go zinging at it.
*  And then right when you get to the campfire, you pull the airplane into the vertical, you stroke
*  the afterburners, you let them light off, you count to three, you pull them off, and then you
*  just go away. Instant UFO reporting. I'm sitting out in the desert. It's all quiet. And then all
*  of a sudden there's a lure, there's lights in the sky and they go away and it's gone.
*  The campfire is out.
*  You would do that just to fuck with campers?
*  Yes.
*  How rude.
*  Yes. Yes, I did. I'm not the only one that did it, but like I said, we have a sick sense of humor.
*  Yes, I'm sure.
*  So some things are explainable because I guarantee there were phone calls made on some of the stuff
*  that we did.
*  And I guarantee you're not the only one who's ever done that.
*  Oh, I know I'm not. Yeah, I'm not that creative, but it's just, you know, you think about it,
*  you go because people go, I saw this or I saw that because I've got stuff like that. And I go,
*  yeah, I used to create stuff like that. Just not tell.
*  Do you, are you, Jeremy, I'm sure you're aware of this, the footage from the Mexican Air Force?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very aware of that.
*  What do you think about that?
*  Well, again, it's IR footage, which is really interesting. They actually got the cameras for
*  drug runners, right? So you can see in the infrared, so it's beyond the observable eye.
*  I myself have not detailed looked at the footage. However, FLIR experts and people that work with
*  NSA have looked at it for me. And these are not lights in the distance. These are craft,
*  very similar to what Commander Favre talks about without plumes, without heat signatures,
*  you know, non-traditional field propulsion systems. We don't have that.
*  I thought they tried to, is this it right here? Is this the Mexican Air Force footage?
*  Yeah. So they tried to say these were lights on like an oil rig out in the water. That's Bindi Bomb.
*  Yeah, they tried to say it was a fire and an oil rig, right?
*  No.
*  The 2004 Comcast video of the year was the Mexican Air Force tracking like six. So literally right
*  after our incident, I come, we come back and I think we were getting ready to go to Fallon.
*  And I'm, I had Comcast and the homepage comes up and there's this video and I go,
*  holy cow, that looks like what we chased. And it was like six of these things and they were
*  tracking them in the same area too, right off the coast of Ensenada.
*  And it's not as rare. There's now admitted an increased frequency that a Pentagon spokeswoman
*  finally went off script. I was tracking the scripts for the last two years of what Pentagon
*  spokespeople say about Commander Favre's experience. Someone went off script last week in the New York
*  Times and she admitted there's an increased frequency of near misses because of these AAVs,
*  anomalous aerospace vehicles. So it's pretty astounding. We're getting all these kind of
*  revelatory moments in these little seeds that these are not ours. We don't have this. Even Elon
*  doesn't have this. I mean, this is a propulsion system, unlike anything we have. It's amazing.
*  It's gravity propelled. Now that gimbal footage, when it said that there's a fleet of them,
*  how far away are those guys where you're seeing, you don't see the individual objects,
*  you only see a singular spot? Well, the pod is, you know, when you get pretty narrow, it'd be like,
*  if I put three people around you, I can look at you and not see the other people. So that's what
*  the pod is doing. But the radar is seeing everything because it has an ESA radar in it,
*  which is an active electronically scanned array. So instead of like the radars we had, which did
*  the mechanical doing this, like old school, this thing is just a panel that sits in the front of
*  the airplane and through beam shaping, it can move and it can look all over. So we used to have what
*  was called track while scan. So we would be able to track a target while we're still scanning. This
*  thing has scan while it scans while tracks. So it literally, if it sees you, if the radar sees you,
*  it has basically a weapons quality solution. Then it can do that on multiple targets.
*  That's the same way the spy radar, the Aegis system works on the cruisers.
*  It can track multiple targets and have weapons quality on all these different targets while it's
*  still scanning a volume. So in that image, you're seeing one individual object, but there's other
*  objects? Yes. The radar is seeing the object that the pod is looking at where they're talking,
*  and when you hear the video, you hear the pilot say, dude, look at the SA page. There's a whole
*  fleet of them. So what they're seeing is the pod is looking at the main, that's the bigger object
*  that the gimbal, the thing that's roll tight on the screen, and there's five smaller things in front.
*  So this thing's just sitting there and then they kind of, he said they turn around on the radar and
*  start going the other way while the pod's looking at this guy just kind of rotating.
*  So like a mothership and smaller aircraft. Could be. Something along those lines. Is there video
*  of those smaller aircrafts or just the video of the one large one? The only thing they have is the
*  targeting pod. I would highly doubt even if they had the video that they're going to release the
*  radar video because of classification levels. Are you able to tell the story you told me about what
*  was underwater with your other buddy? Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. So it's amazing. People come out of
*  the woodwork when they figure out you've had this because now they don't feel alone. So I was working,
*  I worked, I still do it, but I was doing oil and gas at the time on a contract and one of the guys,
*  the story came out and he was a Navy helicopter pilot. And he comes in, he comes in, he goes,
*  can I talk to you, man? I go, what about you? He goes, dude, I got to talk to you. I said,
*  what do you want to talk to me about? He says, dude, do you know your UFO? He said, yeah. He goes,
*  I had a similar experience. I said, what's that? He said, he was flying CH-53s, which is a big lift,
*  heavy lift that the Marine Corps uses and the Navy uses it for certain things. And when they go
*  off of, for the East Coast, they do a lot of shooting off of, at the time it was off of Puerto
*  Rico. We had Roosevelt roads that they ended up closing, but he was flying out of there. And you
*  know, you got super clear Caribbean water and they have these things called BQMs. They fly around and
*  then when they're all done, because they'll fly towards the ships and the ship can, sorry about
*  that, they can track with the radar. And then they also do in the, like the ships or submarine
*  shoot torpedoes, they're called telemetry rounds. So they have, they gather all the data on what the
*  torpedo is doing underwater and then they blow ballast and this thing will come to the surface
*  and float and then they go pick them up and then they can extract all the data out of them. So
*  they do it for both. So he said, the first time they're out and they're going to pick up this BQM
*  and those things, when they're flying, they're done, a parachute comes out and they got to go,
*  they hook it up, the helo drops the swimmer in the water. He goes and hooks this whole thing up
*  and then they hoist the whole thing up and fly back and then they extract the data. So he says,
*  he's sitting in the front, you know, in helicopters, there's, you know, CH-53, you can actually see down
*  by your feet, you know, just like typical, like you go to Hawaiian rides, because you can see when
*  you're touching down. So you got really good visibility out of those things and you can stick
*  your head out the window too, because you're just kind of hanging out. He says he's going on there
*  and they're getting this thing hooked up and as he's looking down, you know, because they're,
*  I don't know what, 50 feet above the water, he sees kind of this dark mass coming up from the depths
*  and they start to hoist the diver up and he's got, they've got the BQM and as they hoist it up, he
*  says, and he's looking at this thing going, what the hell is that? And then it just goes back down
*  underwater. It's just like, once they pull the kid and the BQM out of the water, this object descends
*  back into the depths. So he thinks, well, that was pretty weird. So he goes out, he says, not too long
*  later, you know, a few months later, he's out and he's picking up a torpedo. So he says they got the,
*  they hooked the diver up on the winch and they're lowering him in and as he's looking down, he sees
*  this big, massive, he goes, it's not a submarine, he's seen submarines before. Once you see a
*  submarine, you can't confuse it with something else. This big object, you know, kind of circularly
*  says it's coming up from the depths and he starts screaming through the intercom system to tell him
*  to pull the diver up and the diver's like a few feet from the water. So they reversed the winch and
*  the diver's thinking, what the hell's going on? And he's getting pulled up and all of a sudden,
*  he said the torpedo just got sucked down underwater and the object just descended back down into the
*  depths and they never recovered the torpedo. And this happened in the late 90s, mid to late 90s,
*  I think it is. I can probably get in touch with him and ask him. And he told me this story and I'm
*  like, how do you report that? You come in and go, well, where'd the torpedo go? It just got sucked
*  down. It just went down, you know, and then you get to people that attribute it as something happened
*  when it blew ballast and it just took on water and sank. And he's like, it didn't sink. He goes,
*  it literally looked like it got sucked down. The only reason they didn't, they talked to him when
*  they did the New York Times stuff, they talked to him, but it, because the incident was from the 90s,
*  they didn't want to, they wanted something newer. So they did not include it, but I know they talked
*  to him about it. Now, what was the other footage that we were looking at? There was the first
*  footage that Jamie pulled up that wasn't the gimbal footage that was the go fast. What is that?
*  That's a, it actually looks more like a tic tac, but it's, they saw it going across the water and
*  they're just grabbing a lock. So they're seeing this with their eyes and he gets the flier to lock
*  on it. And that's when you hear the kid go, Oh, I got it. Cause he gets the auto track and it's
*  just something screaming across the surface of the water. So, and this is in the same area?
*  This is East coast. Yeah. This is the same timeframe as the gimbal video. So the idea that these are
*  birds or the idea that this is a radar glitch or somebody said pilot error, like on a clear blue day,
*  commander Fravor has nerves. I mean, that kind of thing that people have said on your show to you,
*  you know, this, these are explanations that make sense. Who said that? I didn't want to say the
*  name. Oh, McWest? Yeah, sure. McBilly's everything. Like every single thing that's ever happened has
*  a rational explanation for it. Yeah. So, so, you know, the probability that, you know, all the
*  radars went off at the wrong time, commander Fravor, you know, had nerves at all the other pilots up
*  there with him that, you know, this thing shot off like a, like a can, like a gun instantly, like
*  that, that was somehow perfectly coordinated. That's a conspiracy. That's a fabrication.
*  Probably, Occam's Razors, the events happened exactly like we're being told.
*  Yeah. For us, it was, you know, and I'll go back to the beginning of the story of, you know, the
*  other pilot who was brand new. She had been in the squadron for four months, five months. So she's
*  pretty junior. She was still working on her initial quality airplane. And, you know, so she gets the,
*  you know, we get the real world vector and it's like, okay, real world vector. Cool. I'm going to
*  get to do something real exciting. Then you see the water and you think, oh, something's sinking
*  because it's kind of that shape of an airplane, you know, that cross type. So now it's, oh crap,
*  now it's search and rescue. We got to go down and see, you know, cause there's people, you know,
*  and we are sympathetic and to the Tic Tac. And as soon as the Tic Tac, it's like, you know,
*  holy shit, what is that? You know, and when you get, you know, some people get very emotional
*  when you talk about it. Because for me, it was like, eh, you know, for her, when you talk to her,
*  she has a disdain for some of the leadership that didn't tell us that these things were out there.
*  You know, they're here now we're getting vectored because we were the first time the manned airplanes
*  had been airborne when one of these things showed up. That no one even gave us a brief that, hey,
*  we're seeing these objects out here for the last two weeks. They're just kind of, you might want
*  to know they're out there. And they never told us, no one knew these things existed besides the
*  radar operators and the radar operators didn't know what they were. They just knew they were
*  seeing blips, you know? So there's a lot of stuff that, you know, that it flew around and it came
*  around me and it didn't do any of that stuff. It's the story that I gave you. It was just relatively
*  benign. Um, but it was, you know, it's, it's an interesting experience. So these incidents that
*  they reported were taking place before you saw your, that tic tac encounter. They were taking
*  place over a period of how many weeks? Two weeks. We went out in the beginning of the month for this
*  two week at sea period. Um, we pulled in for Thanksgiving, but other than that, we were out
*  till I think December 21st is when we pulled the ship back in, uh, besides pulling in for the three
*  days at Thanksgiving. So yeah, for the two weeks prior. So this was on the 14th and we went out
*  at the beginning of the month. So about two weeks, they'd been watching these things come down, go
*  up, come down, go up. But it was always when we were not flying, which is really probably like the
*  midnight timeframe until early in the morning, the next, you know, till noon the next day.
*  And then we just happened to go. And if you think about it, you know, I laugh at, you know, if,
*  if there was some little green man flying around in that tic tac, he probably got back to the
*  mothership and got yelled at for being seen. But you're like, Oh my God, you let them see you.
*  So, so have you communicated with anybody that has any thoughts on what, what these things are doing
*  or whether or not there's any consistency to the size of them or whether or not they, they think
*  they're coming out of a larger object or anything along these lines? No. Um, you know, you can ask,
*  well, cause I was asking, you know, what do you think they were doing? You know, and I said,
*  you can look, well, they were observing, you know, cause they're coming down and watching.
*  Number two is they were communicating. Cause I think, you know, in my heart, I think there was
*  something under the water. I don't, you know, what it was doing there, but when we went back,
*  because when you saw the X, the cross looking thing, explain that again. So the disturbance
*  seemed to be in the shape of a cross. Like I describe it as it's about the size of a 737.
*  So just think if you submerge the 737, pointing it to the East underwater by like,
*  you know, 10, 15 feet. So as these waves are coming across, when they, you know,
*  they hit that object, they're going to break on top, just like you would with a submerged,
*  like a seamount. So, and it's, it's, they're breaking it. And that's where the Tic Tac was
*  at. That's the only reason we saw the Tic Tac. That's what drew our eyes down there is we see
*  this white water when it's a perfectly clear day with no white caps and you go, whoa, what's that?
*  And then you see the Tic Tac and then we, you know, we do all the chasing of the Tic Tac and
*  we turn, we're right there and we turn around and there's no white water. It's just blue as far as
*  you can see. So at that point you go, okay, what was it doing? Because there was obviously something
*  there that's not there now. So that's where I say, well, it was observing us. It was, could have been
*  communicating with whatever was there. You know, and then someone else looked at me and said, you
*  know, I was talking to Lou and he goes, what about prepping the battlefield? I go, okay. You know,
*  so if you go, you know, where are these things from? We don't know. You know, are they from China,
*  Russia, someplace else? I don't know. But it's a capability that we do not possess to my knowledge.
*  And if you ask me in 2004, cause there's a lot of guys go out, maybe it's some secret government
*  program. I go, all right, well, let's be honest. One, if you have a propulsion system that made it,
*  gave the capabilities that we observed visually, that's a huge leap for mankind period.
*  So you would say, yeah, there was, you know, think about it. It's going to be 15 years next month
*  that we saw this. I would like to think that, okay, maybe let's just say in 2004, it was
*  something somebody had this, some government had this, ours, whatever. If you come to now,
*  you go 15 years later, you don't think that technology would have emerged because it literally
*  would change everything we do. I mean, we're happy about, you know, hybrid and electric cars
*  and all this other stuff. But if you've got something that works like that air travel,
*  it would change air travel forever. No visible system of propulsion. No plumes.
*  No, it's just a, that's, we joke. It's a, that's a, think of a 40 foot long tick tack that can move
*  at will through the air at speeds well beyond what we've ever witnessed. I mean, even when you watch
*  a rocket go off, you know, one of Elon's or one of the NASA, whatever, you know, you sit there and
*  while I grew up during the Apollo ages and where you just look at the thing, go up, up, up, up, up.
*  I've seen them shot out of Vandenberg where you go, you know, I'd sit in my house in central
*  California and you watch you go up and go, well, I can watch that thing for a while. This is something
*  that just like poof, in a matter of seconds is gone. Now are other pilots or other people that
*  have cited these things, have they also reported something larger that's in the water near it?
*  No, not the ones I've talked to. I mean, I think, you know, you can get on History Channel,
*  there's all kinds of stuff on there about people talking about stuff, but you know what,
*  here's the question is what do you believe? What do you not believe? And you know, my biggest
*  frustration is, you know, our incident and even the folks on the East coast, it is what it is to us.
*  There's no reason to embellish. There's no reason to make stuff up, but yet there's still groups of
*  people that are making stuff up. Like someone came out on ours was talking about, and he's like,
*  I saw the whole video is 10 minutes long and it was doing all this. It's bullshit.
*  What you see is that's literally the entire video. It's a minute and a half long. I think it's about
*  a minute and a half long. What people haven't seen that I saw, I mean, I've seen the radar tapes
*  because I had them as my squadron. You know, I've heard, you know, the men in black, you know, I
*  just, I'm afraid, you know, maybe the, okay, I'll give you the credit if they did, but why wouldn't
*  they show up and talk to the guys who actually witnessed it, chased it and is one of the senior
*  guys in the battle group. Right. And it's also possible that that men in black stuff was something
*  that they used to do back in the day and that that program was no longer continued. And, you know,
*  from Jeremy, you would know this, the older sightings when they go back into the day to
*  historical sightings and I'm not, not Columbus, but you know, in the fifties and sixties, did they have
*  similar things that they talked about or something moved in this manner? Yeah, it's absolutely
*  incredible. And I want to dumb this down because that's how I had to understand it. When I was
*  talking with the commander favor years before I kept his secret years before the New York Times
*  blew it up. I told them it was probably going to happen. It wasn't by me. We were talking about it.
*  This system that we have seen for over 70 years, just documented by our military, this is so
*  important. This is a non-reactionary field propulsion system. Everything we know is a
*  reactionary propulsion system. You push something out the back, it goes forward. This is not like a
*  MAG system. This is a gravitational field propulsion system. And throughout history,
*  our military has documented them and there has been ridicule. And I'll tell you exactly why. 1952,
*  there was a huge flyover of Washington, D.C. Jets were scrambled. All the papers covered it. It's
*  very famous, you know, case everybody can look up. It's an important case because at that time,
*  a policy was started and that policy started because it crashed our communications. The teletypes
*  went down. The panic of the UFOs that were being seen by people with fighter pilots trying to
*  capture and trying to engage them and it crashed the teletypes. So our government was like, oh,
*  that's not happening again because, you know, Russia could use that as a scare tactic. So this
*  policy of denial, don't look here, nothing to see, move on, UFOs are fake. That's what Project
*  Blue Book was tasked to do specifically. The guy who ran it admitted that, that it was tasked to
*  debunk this and demystify the UFO thing. That's J. Allen Hynek, correct? Right. I also, yeah,
*  J. Allen Hynek. He was once asked by a friend of mine, do you have the smoking gun? I'll give you
*  this document. It's pretty amazing. It's an Air Force manual where they explain what they know about
*  UFOs at that time in 1967. But here's the point. Yes, this has been going on since the beginning
*  of recorded human history. These propulsion systems that are captured on footage, you know,
*  that is confirmed now by the Pentagon, like Commander Fravor's experience, this technology
*  is not ours. It was here 70 years ago. You used to tell me about 15 years ago. We would see it now.
*  These exact things at 20,000 miles an hour going on 70 years ago documented. Somebody has a
*  non-reactionary fuel propulsion system. Now are they aliens or some subsect of human? You know,
*  somebody has them and they're flying through our airspace with impunity and pilots like Commander
*  Fravor, who by the way, defended Los Angeles overnight after 9 11. I mean, this is a guy we
*  put all of our trust in. He was defending Los Angeles right after 9 11. So we got people like
*  him coming forward saying, I saw this and you get internet warriors being like, it's a bird,
*  it's a glitch, it's Superman. Let's not concentrate on them. What about the Columbus thing? Did you
*  find that? Yeah, it's just listed as like light 1492 light signature event that they saw light in
*  the distance that could have been bioluminescent. Is the actual text? No, there's no, just like
*  Wikipedia stuff. It's just one of the oldest accounts I was trying to throw out that this is
*  something that- Do you know of, there's a very famous painting that shows what appears to be
*  men in crafts flying through the sky in the background of an ancient painting. Do you know
*  what I'm talking about? I do. I actually have a page, one of the first pages I ever put on my
*  website is like a bunch of these because throughout history, there are these indications of ships,
*  of craft. But you know what I'm talking about? It's like, and that's the shape of it. It's also
*  like a plate turned on its side and then there's a person inside of it. Yeah, yeah, man. It's
*  flying through in that same, yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like look, look how it's flying. But you know,
*  the thing is, is that everybody can say art, the one above that's pretty cool because that was a
*  hidden thing. I've studied that one where it says discovery 15th century. Above her left shoulder,
*  there is an object and if you really zoom in, look at the dude staring up at it as a painter. My
*  wife is a painter. Everything is intentional. Where's the guy? The guy on the- Yeah, right over
*  there is pretty cool. Looking up. So I think that's 15th century it said. So the problem with this,
*  Joe, is it- Go to the original one, the one that we just looked at, Jamie, the one right before that.
*  Yeah, see, get a big picture of that. That is so strange. Like here you got Christ being crucified
*  and then above him, UFOs. Like is that supposed to be aliens or is that supposed to be angels?
*  What is that supposed to be in these things that they have? It's real, similar to what we're talking
*  about here. That's the argument of miracle of Fatima, let's say. I mean, again, this is so
*  speculative. We have a witness here, you know, pilot, but when you see something like the miracle
*  of Fatima, if you look at that- What is the miracle of Fatima? God, that's that one that was,
*  you know, considered a real miracle by the church and the three kids were getting messages,
*  I'll get this all wrong, but for like months that they're going to be visited and to bring people
*  in bigger and bigger groups gathered to where there was over 100,000 people- What year is this?
*  1917. 1917. 1917. So, you know, dozens of thousands, if not hundreds, but dozens for sure,
*  see an event, a mass sighting of something that happened. We're talking people that were
*  religious, people that weren't religious, you know, doctors at the time. That's not a real image,
*  is it, Jamie? That one was doctored a little bit so you could see like they're all looking at
*  something. But that's not real. Yeah, but that's the crowd, right? The crowd is real. Is that right?
*  Yeah, yeah. So here's the thing, people come out, something happened that was so
*  intense. Some people thought it was religious, that it was a visitation, but other people saw it as
*  technological, like something descended. You know, look into it, I'm just saying art, pictures,
*  like paintings we're talking about, man, you can interpret them all day. I can't hold on to that.
*  I can't hold on to an eyewitness with other eyewitnesses, with radar systems, and with video.
*  We're in a different era now. We don't have to paint it, man. We get to see it. It's fascinating,
*  man. It is fascinating, but it's way more fascinating when someone like you talks about it versus
*  some fucking random kook. You know, that's what makes me incredibly interested is the, just
*  your credibility and the fact that this is not, you don't have a history of seeing wacky shit
*  that other people don't see. No, just this once. But it's on video and that there's other ones as
*  well. It's really strange. I've seen people try to explain it away, and what I don't like about
*  when they explain it away or attempt to explain it away is that they're trying really hard.
*  They're not going, who knows what this fucking thing is? They're not looking at it like cleanly.
*  They're looking at it like a quote unquote skeptic. I don't like the idea of being a skeptic.
*  Not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things. I certainly think you should be,
*  but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as skeptics, and I think it's a lazy way to look
*  at things. I really do, because I think you're just looking for the holes in things without
*  looking at it objectively. If you wanted to be a scientist, if you wanted to be someone who is a
*  fan of science, then you have to look at it as a thing. Look at this information and let's study
*  this without any bias, any preconceived notions. I don't think they're doing that. They're looking
*  at it and they're trying to find a way where they can justify that it's fake, and they're just doing
*  all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake. That video that you show where that thing
*  slips off to the left and takes off at incredible rates of speed, that alone should freak people
*  the fuck out. Yeah, well I think because people confuse all the time, like we took the video,
*  no it was another crew that took the video. We watched it for five minutes with our eyeballs,
*  and there was four of us, and we all have the same story. We all saw the same stuff.
*  We all came back and looked at each other and scratched our head and said, WTF, I mean, serious?
*  What was that? And then what do you do? You move on. We never saw it again. I imagine they probably
*  saw them on radar after that. They're probably seeing them on radar all the time. They just don't
*  bring it to the attention of the general public. Oh yeah, because if you don't, you know, for a ship
*  when they see something, you know, what is that? You don't have any way to go out there and look at
*  it. Like when you're talking about how they were informing you that they were seeing these things
*  previous to your mission, when you're doing this exercise and they let you know that they're seeing
*  these things, did you say, hey, how frequent is this? Is this something that happens all the time?
*  I didn't get into that. Ours was more of the moment of, you know, and he's telling us, hey,
*  for the last two weeks we've been tracking these things and we don't know what they are.
*  But you don't know whether or not it was just those two weeks or maybe it was a year ago.
*  There was other similar situations or... There's other situations that have happened out there,
*  but I would say, you know, for this, I don't even know. One, you got to take it serious.
*  We have a tendency, if we don't know what it is, if we just ignore it, it'll go away.
*  You know, and I joke, you know, there was an incident years... It's probably not too far off
*  the same timeframe, but I think it was like the Constellation was doing her workups before she
*  got decommissioned and an Oscar class, a Soviet Oscar class submarine surfaced behind her. Right?
*  And then it's now it's like, you know, go to battle stations, World War Three, how did this
*  how did this foreign submarine get in our area and has been monitoring our workups? That's a big deal.
*  I said, but now we go out and we have these things that are coming at will,
*  and there's nothing we can do about it. We don't know what they are. We have confirmed sighting by
*  two aircrew, four of us, two planes that said, look, this is not an airplane. This is not a
*  weather balloon. This is not a blip. It has performance well beyond, you know, and the
*  airplanes that we were flying at the time were literally brand new Super Hornets right out of
*  the Boeing factory. I mean, these were brand new first Block Two series that came out.
*  And you go, why wasn't something done? You know, it's like, ah, we don't know what it is.
*  I think it's good now, you know, the moves that have happened over the last, you know,
*  two years since the original article came out that, you know, there now there's a new reporting
*  for the pilots, the Navy's acknowledged, hey, these things, we don't know what they were,
*  you know, they're starting to take it serious because, you know, I know there are other events
*  that are not out, recent events where people have been called in to go, hey, I've seen this thing.
*  So the investigation process is still going on. You know, we don't, we don't stop, the military
*  doesn't stop. Even if you take funding away, we don't stop. You know, we don't stop until we're
*  told to stop. So, you know, what's, what's going on? I, you know, you go, well, ATIP ended, you
*  know, they spent four and a half million dollars a year on it. I think it was four and it was 22
*  million over the five years. So you go, what are they doing since then? Well, I mean, I'm pretty
*  sure there's still people looking at this and there's still people that are taking this serious.
*  I will tell you that I won't get into specifics, but there are people inside the United States
*  government that are taking this serious. And I've been, I've been down to DC twice to talk to folks,
*  you know, behind closed doors to go, cause they want to hear the story. And I've got a lot of,
*  you gotta be joking. I mean, this, this seriously happened. And, and, and I'm like, yeah, it did
*  happen. And it is real. What are you doing about it? So what kind of people are you talking to?
*  High level government officials is what I'll say. And most of that is because that conversation is
*  between me and them. And I don't want people speculating, but you can say,
*  high level government officials I have talked to. Well, that was always the speculation about like,
*  what would someone do if they became president? Well, the first thing I would do is I would tell
*  everybody about the UFOs. I would ask immediately what's going on. And I always thought about,
*  I said, how many people actually know what's going on and how much of the information, I mean,
*  it's not like if they're dealing with something like this, like your, your experience, it seems
*  like what you described is what is known. So it's this anomalous event where this thing
*  defies our current understanding of technology, and then it's gone. And so what do you have?
*  You don't have anything else other than that. Like what other information does anybody have?
*  Well, I would say, I would say this, because I've talked to Bob, we were, we did a,
*  Bob Lazar.
*  Yeah, we did an event together. And I'll leave it to everyone to, if it's up to you to believe Bob,
*  I'll say this, Bob's a normal guy. Bob's not crazy.
*  He's not crazy at all.
*  Not at all.
*  That was the weirdest thing about talking to him.
*  But when you, when you look at it and go, because I had asked Bob, I said,
*  what he describes in the technology, when he talks about his, his story, I said, well,
*  do you honestly think we could, you know, reverse engineer it? I said, how long do you think it
*  would take us? And his response to me was another hundred years. He goes, Dave, it was so far beyond,
*  he goes, the stuff that he says he worked on, he's like, you know, he was on your podcast,
*  because I watched it, you know, hey, there was no wires. And because I had asked him,
*  when he said you first described the ship that he got to see, he said, I used to say, you know,
*  they built it and then it was like wax and you'd heat it up. He goes, now I would say it was built
*  with 3D printing, because now with 3D printing, we can build things literally from the ground up.
*  It's basically built as one, not panels, no rivets, it's just made. And so when you talk about that,
*  and you go, well, it's still another hundred years. So you go, well, what if you had the
*  technology, we still, if what Bob says is correct, we still don't understand it. And how fast would it
*  take us to understand that? I mean, if it's driven by something that we don't even have on Earth,
*  which is when he talks about that element, we can't create it, you know, we can create it for
*  microsecond and then it, you know, it decays and we go. Yeah. So, you know, I think we're still a
*  long ways off. You know, I'll argue with the people that go, you know, are we really alone?
*  I was telling Jeremy, we used to go out on goggles, you know, out in the middle of the Pacific,
*  there's no light pollution, night vision goggles, so we can see, well, you go out at night,
*  I'd be on like a tanker hop or something, just hanging out, not doing anything, driving around
*  in circles with the autopilot on, you just turn all the lights down in the cockpit. So you have no
*  light pollution and just roll your head back and look up. There's billions and billions and billions
*  of stars out there. And, you know, I always look up because I'm like, you know, are we alone? And I
*  go, I look up and go, well, if we're the only ones around and that's, and I'm looking, everything
*  I'm looking at, it's a pretty sad place. It's a pretty lonely universe. I asked my astrophysics
*  prof that once, I said, you believe in extraterrestrial life? And she's like, of course not. And I said,
*  well, there's billions and billions of planets. You think we're it? I mean, just the probability
*  of it is you'd go, oh, there's probably something else out there. And I'm not crazy. I'm just opening
*  up the possibility that we are not the only planet that has life on it. I think people don't like to
*  seem silly. They don't like to be foolish. And I think when people start talking about anything,
*  it's not proven or anything that's connected to a bunch of loony people that are making up stories,
*  which UFOs certainly are. UFOs are connected to so many people that have made up so many stories.
*  What was that gentleman's name from? You would know that guy who's from another country,
*  Billy something or another. Billy Meyer. Billy Meyer. Yeah. Seems a hundred percent full of shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's proven to have done tons of hoaxes with this, but here's the deal. Sometimes I think
*  people have a real experience and they're always like chasing that dragon and they get UFO disease
*  and the brain goes fucking berserk, right? I know that there are people that have had profound
*  experiences and then they can't ever replicate them. So then they just start going crazy. And
*  I don't blame them for it, but you got someone like Commander Fravor, when he saw that AAV,
*  anomalous aerospace vehicle, his reaction was, I want to fly it. That's a pretty cool reaction.
*  I'd like to fly it. Yeah. Imagine flying that thing. That's what I told my buddy,
*  he was my ex-o at the time, Dell. I got back after all this happening, looks at me and
*  we're just standing right here. And he goes, Hey dude, I go, what do you think it is? I go,
*  I have no idea, but it was pretty fricking impressive and I'd like to fly it. Of course.
*  And he goes, yeah, I go, I mean, it was, it was, you know, it's just like any pilot,
*  you always want to find the coolest thing. Of course. Yeah. Of course. You race car driver,
*  you want to drive the fastest car. That's it. Now you look at it and go, well, that's something we
*  don't have. Yeah. This idea that, you know, maybe we're not alone, that some of these other stars
*  have planets that are maybe technologically advanced. So the next thing people say,
*  and you know, new errors are going to say, well, they're not coming here because the distance is
*  so vast. Hold the fuck up from the very beginning. When Babasar came forward and talked about field
*  propulsion, gravity propulsion, distance becomes completely irrelevant. So if we believe the,
*  and the radars are right and commander Faber saw this thing move in like a ping pong ball in a
*  glass of water, it's gravity propelled. That's why you can make those maneuvers without exploding.
*  Okay. Then distance becomes completely irrelevant for travel. You're literally warping time and
*  space. You're falling into place. Well, it's like the idea of showing someone a video on your phone
*  long before video was ever invented. People would be like, what are you talking about? Like before
*  photography was invented, which is shockingly recent, right? You got to draw pictures of things
*  you saw, just like those people that drew or painted that those images of those men and whatever
*  those things were with Christ in the background. The idea that we could understand what some
*  insanely impressive technology from a planet that is nowhere near us could manifest. It's nuts.
*  Yeah. Babasar talks a lot about this. Remember, he's a young guy, right? In 1989, he gets shown
*  something and all of a sudden he's trying to interpret it through 1989 technology. So he said,
*  it looks like it was injection molded because that's what he had. And then I sent him this
*  thing about nanotechnology and working towards an atomic printer. He's like, dude, that makes a lot
*  more sense. So he has to view it through where he saw it in 1989. However, I will say this,
*  it is my knowledge that we understand exactly how these craft work. Our one limiting factor is our
*  material science. We can't replicate not the fuel source itself is another- When you say we know
*  exactly how they work. Yeah. It doesn't break our laws of physics. This concept of amplification
*  of gravity, this concept of gravity propulsion, we understand how things can move from point A to
*  point B almost instantaneously. Our physics doesn't disallow it, but our material science
*  and the fuel to create that machine that we have machines from other places.
*  What do you mean? Well, Babasar, whether you believe him or not, there was a program,
*  I have other witnesses that I will be bringing forward about S4 where he worked. We have-
*  You have other witnesses that worked with alongside Bob?
*  No, no. People that corroborate Bob's account in that they saw him get on and off the red and
*  whites, the Janet flights that come on, somebody that went to Papoose Lake and was stopped by
*  non-military guards at that time, people that we're aware of, Site 4 and ET exploitation projects.
*  One is an SR-71 pilot that I've been talking with for a couple years. These people are coming
*  forward now, and it's like I'm sick and tired of doing it, these little nitpicky things about Bob.
*  Okay, there was a program. There was a back engineering program. They've admitted there are
*  materials, so this is like the metamaterials you heard about in the New York Times, all that. We
*  have materials associated with UFOs that are interesting. What is that? What are you talking
*  about? So this is something that was launched in the first New York Times article, I believe,
*  in December of 2017, that there is studies being done right now on materials associated with UFOs,
*  right? So actual metals that have come off of, you could say crashes or-
*  Who is that that explained that there was something, they were with Eric Weinstein,
*  that was explaining that there was someone who reportedly has something along those lines?
*  Jacques Vallee has 17 samples.
*  17 samples? How does one guy get 17 samples?
*  Well, he's Jacques fucking Vallee, right? So he is the guy first ever for the United States
*  military created a computer program for the study of UFOs for Project Blue Books. He's an
*  old school guy. They modeled him after in the Close Encounters movie, it's modeled after Jacques
*  Vallee, the French guy. So he's kind of like been involved with this. He's had more access to
*  government databases than any of us. He went around, collected samples from known crashes
*  or like when things will come off. And what's the conclusion?
*  Well, they're studying them right now. There was just something on Fox about they're studying
*  some of these materials and what they will find because I actually the ones they're talking about,
*  I actually took to New Mexico and had five scientists study it about five years ago.
*  I got my hands on it, got to study it, the famous parts they're talking about now.
*  It's layered. And the way it's layered is what they're trying to see if it's anomalous,
*  elementally, or the way that the elements are bound together. And also the atomic level of
*  layering is what's interesting. We'll find out if it's interesting.
*  Explain what you're talking about. What is this thing that you saw?
*  Okay, well, there are a lot of different samples. But when you get a sample of something and you can
*  see- How big are these samples?
*  The ones that I looked at, they ranged from about this size down.
*  Speak audio.
*  You know, they range from the size of an orange.
*  Size of an orange.
*  Yeah, size of an orange to the size of a quarter. These are materials, right?
*  The materials from a crash?
*  So that's allegedly, or there's a known crash. This is in the public domain rather than,
*  you know, government control. So what I was looking at or having the scientists look at
*  is isotopically and elementally. What are the elements that are in this? Are they engineered?
*  And what's the conclusion?
*  Well, I'm not, I'm going to leave it to the people that are doing it now who have much
*  better machines than I had access to.
*  Do you know any cliff notes?
*  Yeah, they, from what I understand, there's atomic layering. There are levels of, like we
*  do with graphene. We lay down these layers that are basically oriented at a certain degree.
*  That's how you get a superconductor or something like that. If you take a piece of graphene
*  and you, and it's highly machined, so it's not, doesn't deviate from that atomic layering,
*  you can push it right through ice, like a hot knife through butter. It's the weirdest feeling
*  in the world because you just take this piece of what feels like graphene and it goes right
*  through butter because it's a superconductor and the heat from your hand melts the ice.
*  So that is a meta material. It doesn't occur naturally. Humans created it and it has special
*  properties because of the way it's atomically layered. So if these materials are from somewhere
*  else, then we suspect that they're going to be highly machined, that they're going to be
*  created for special use. So my whole point is our material science has not caught up with the
*  physics that we understand for these field propulsion systems. I'm just telling you,
*  believe me or not, but you'll hear more about it, that our material science in 1989 and today is
*  our limiting factor. And as our material science gets better as humans, we know how these things
*  work. Now the fuel source, that's a whole other conversation. But as far as creating these machines,
*  that's what we're trying to do. That's why there is secrecy. We're trying to exploit the technology
*  because whoever exploits it first wins. It's a game changer. We don't want Russia to do it.
*  We don't want China to do it. If we had a non-reactionary propulsion system,
*  the world would look different instantaneously. What is your perspective after the incident versus
*  before the incident? Like how much did it change the way you view the world and our place in the
*  world? For me, I mean, I always, I never believed that we were alone. It's just me. I just look up
*  and go, there's way too many stars up there for us to be on life. After it, it makes it a little
*  more clear to go, one, my questions are, where'd it come from? That's the biggest one. Where'd it
*  come from? What was it doing? And then I've asked, why me? I mean, why did I happen to be,
*  because you can say wrong place, wrong time. Right. Or right place, right time.
*  Right time. For me, it was, I think there's more out there. And if I could get word out to anyone,
*  it's like, especially the debunkers of one, quit trying to debunk it because it is what it is.
*  It wasn't a system glitch. I mean, this was a real incident that happened.
*  And number two is let's open our aperture a little bit and start thinking outside of the box.
*  If you go, you look at it and go, hey, it's this non-reactive propulsion. Well, it's because when
*  we came up with propulsion, the people long before us came up with a reactionary propulsion
*  system. And that became our standard. Had we done something different or we developed non-reaction,
*  we might look at something like a gasoline engine and go, holy cow, how's that thing work?
*  We wouldn't have that idea. So I think there's, if you look at it and go,
*  people thought Einstein was kind of nuts. And we're still proving his theories today.
*  And what we're learning is that he was right. And he was right. There was a time when the earth
*  was flat, except for some people in California, the earth isn't flat, it's round. It's not just
*  people in California. They're all over the place. There's not an ice wall. So when you look at that
*  and you go, a lot of the stuff that we thought was true, isn't true. It's totally been changed. So
*  for me, I just say, I think let's get outside of the box and go, if we can develop a technology
*  and I don't look at it from a military standpoint, because it would be a game changer
*  from a military standpoint. Technology like that would be a game changer for mankind,
*  completely. I mean, it would literally, everything that we do, and we don't know exactly,
*  do you want that system in a car? People have trouble driving in two dimensions, let alone three.
*  It's kind of like your joke last night. I mean, you can't even handle the vaping thing, let alone
*  driving a car that goes up, down, works in three dimensions. Well, that was what they originally
*  wanted helicopters to be. They wanted to be flying cars. Yeah, if you get out on the road,
*  you see how people drive. And I always laugh because people think, well, we're three-dimensional.
*  We know that this table is not the floor, but really humans are two-dimensional people.
*  And you learn that, especially when we would fight, if you can really work in the third dimension,
*  which is up, and you go, well, we are three-dimensional. I go, no, if you look at
*  a tall building, it's 1700 feet high, the big ones. And you go, no, for an F-18 to do a split
*  S, which is go from up here and just do a vertical 180-degree turn, so you're going this way and you
*  go down here, it's like 2500 feet. And that's tight. That's a tight turn for a jet, unless you're
*  running like vector thrust stuff, but everything has a cost. So if you do some big hi-aca,
*  you bleed off energy. There's a cost associated with that. That to a pilot, that's three dimensions.
*  To most people on earth, you go, I look at a hill and go, I don't want to walk up that thing.
*  And in an airplane, it's a totally different thing. So if we just open up that expanse
*  for what we're trying to do for technology and go, is there another way? Because we still build
*  suckers and blowers, which is a jet engine. We just refine the internals, the turbines,
*  to get them to be more efficient. Where I go, I know you just put your efforts someplace else.
*  I was talking to, there's a whole realm of physics that really doesn't get explained.
*  I was talking to Steve Justice about it. It's more into the magnetics type side
*  that we don't spend a lot of time on. And I know he said when he was working at Skunk Works,
*  he did it, it's called IRED, internal research and development money, that he would fund to try and
*  look at some of these other technologies for propulsion. And he's now since retired, but
*  really impressive to talk to him at the level that you can, which is for us would be an unclassified
*  level. But the stuff that goes on behind closed doors, there's reasons for it. Because if a
*  technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce it after all you've done,
*  or they got it first, you think of the atomic bomb, Germans almost had it, we got it, Russians
*  were working on it, we got it first. Changed the world. Literally changed the world when we
*  detonated the first one and you go, I'm not going to get into the politics behind it. But
*  now we had it and now it was the race everyone else because they had to get on equal par because
*  it's a destabilizing thing. And now if you develop a technology like this and you keep it to yourself,
*  you've got something that no one else has and it's a huge leap. I mean, it's a quantum leap.
*  Do you share it? Because it's a mankind thing. Or do you keep it for yourself?
*  Right now it's not for me to decide. I'm just Dave.
*  Well, it's fascinating that some other method of propulsion could have been established in
*  some other place. And that we're experiencing it or that you've experienced it and some other folks
*  have experienced it in action. And I just think for us as people, as human beings in 2019, it's
*  really easy to think that what we have now is so amazing. And that what we have now is the
*  pinnacle of discovery. And that what we have now is with our electricity and with our LED screens
*  and that we are experiencing the height of technology. If you're some creature from some
*  other planet that has got easy access to element 115 and some gravity propulsion system, you're
*  looking at us like we're digging holes in the side of a mountain to protect ourselves from the
*  rain. We're cave people. Yes. Well, we do that here on earth. I mean, you look at like a first
*  world, like the United States or these developed nations. And then you go to some of these other
*  and go, people are still getting their water out of a hole in the ground with a bucket.
*  Right. Or people in the rainforests are living these indigenous lifestyles.
*  Yeah. So take them some, take them one of these flat screens down to one of these tribes that
*  no one's ever seen and go, hey, look, and start showing them pictures of themselves that you're
*  shooting real time or video that's feeding directly into it. They'll freak out. They'll think it's
*  magic. Would you capture my soul? Right. So it's where are we at and what are we going to do and
*  what can we do? Did it change the way you look at life? I mean, even though you knew that or you had
*  this feeling that we were not alone just from looking at the stars, but when you actually see
*  the thing, like how, I mean, I would imagine that that has got to really shift your perspective.
*  I don't know if it shifted my perspective, but it was more of a, it's a validation.
*  A confirmation.
*  To go, you go, yeah, you know, I've always like, yeah, there's a lot of stars. And then you see
*  something like this and go, well, maybe we're not, because that pushes you to the next point to go,
*  you know, one lands in my front yard, then I'll be 100% sure that we are not alone because it's
*  sitting in my front yard. But I mean, I got within a half mile of this thing, which is people go a
*  half mile is pretty far away. I get not when you're flying an airplane, half mile is like really
*  tight. When they bring you in to have these conversations with high level government officials,
*  how long are these conversations? So I went to the, I've been down, I've talked to three different
*  groups of people. This is post the New York Times article. So the New York Times article comes out
*  in 2017. And then our, our government,
*  The other pilot that was involved had been to DC multiple times. This is how kind of I got in touch
*  with Lou. She had called me and said, Hey, I need to talk to you. So I called her and I said, what's
*  going on? She says, Hey, have you been, has anyone called you about the tick tack? And I said, no,
*  she goes, you know, I've been to the Pentagon like a half dozen times and they'll take me in
*  and anywhere from Starbucks to, you know, inside of a vault. And she goes, and they'll talk to me
*  about the story and then they'll show me a picture. Something goes to look like this. And then she
*  gets pretty frustrated and goes, we call it the tick tack because it looked like a tick tack. What
*  part don't you get? I mean, go get a thing of tick tacks and look at them. When they're saying,
*  did it look like this? They showing her something crafts that they have? No, not pictures that they
*  have, but like a video from someone else. Like they'd show the gimbal video. Hey, like this.
*  Okay. And, and it was no. So, and that's when I told her, I said, well, just, just tell this guy
*  that you're talking to, just give my name and number. I go, I'll talk to him. It's not a big
*  deal to me. You know, and that started. So when we, I got asked, you know, multiple times to go
*  down and talk to, to people, one of them was supposed to be 20 minutes. And these, you know,
*  these are important people getting 20 minutes of some of these folks time is like, that's a huge
*  deal. So we went in thinking, okay, we're going to do the thing 20 minutes and then we're in and,
*  and an hour and a half later we came out. I mean, that's the interest of, you know, and there were
*  some, you know, you get the group, you know, the folks that come in and out, but there's a few,
*  that just sat there and were enamored by what we were saying, like your joke. And we're like, no,
*  this is, this is all real. I mean, these are, these are pretty senior officials that are taking the
*  time out of their day to take this serious, to go, you know, maybe we do need to put a little
*  emphasis on this. I mean, if, if literally, if something can just show up at will and do whatever
*  it wants, and I'd probably at least pay attention. Yeah. Pay attention, but what could be done? I
*  mean, what could they do if you put yourself in a position of one of these high level government
*  officials? What do you do? Just spend more money on looking at them? If you look at money though,
*  I mean, I know when the article came out and they talked about the A-TIP program that Harry Reid got
*  funded $22 million over five years. So it's $4.4 million a year. And you go, everyone's freaking
*  out. Oh, it's $22 million. I know it wasn't $22 million a year. It was 4.4 million. That's not
*  even in the rounding air for the United States. We just got approved what it was $750 billion
*  for a defense budget. $750 billion. If you took a hundred million out of that, it's not even going
*  to put a dent. And I go, why can't you, you know, if you're, if you're only spending four, $4.4 million
*  a year and you can actually get some good work done, cause you don't need a huge team. Because
*  you figure if you look at, I think, I think what's the number like 10, 15% of all these UFOs, like
*  if you look at project Blue Book really remained unexplained. And you go, okay, so you can weed out,
*  you know, you can read out me flying over someone in a campfire and light my afterburners.
*  So you can go, no, that was Dave, me and Dave. So you can weed that stuff out. Now you go,
*  now I'm really kind of concentrating the funds. The most important thing, and I talked to the
*  folks when we were talking, cause we talked about funding and I said, let me leave you with this.
*  And I had got some pretty good stuff. I was talking to Chris Mellon, who's a former
*  undersecretary and understands how the government works. So it was where he gave me some really good
*  feedback. And I said, I talked to him, I said, look, I'm all for you guys funding a program,
*  but what you need to do is fund a program that there's going to be oversight over. When I say
*  oversight, I mean, because what happens is you go, here's money, but we're going to distribute it in
*  the government. So we're going to distribute it to these three different agencies across the United
*  States government. So, you know, I don't just call them agency A, B and C. So you give it to them,
*  you know, and I'll go back to like the 9 11 stuff where we really had the answer,
*  but all the agencies weren't talking to each other to put all the pieces together. And that's
*  my fear that you go, Hey, we're going to take a hundred million dollars of taxpayer money. We're
*  going to fund a program to actually seriously investigate this stuff and look at the technology.
*  But there are three different entities working on their own and not talking to each other. So
*  there's got to be a joint collaboration to where you go, we're going to do it. But you know,
*  Joe's going to be in charge. And you guys are all going to play nice in the sandbox together,
*  because we want to get our money's worth because people will raise the fraud, waste and abuse flag
*  that we're wasting money on something stupid. Now the gimbal video shows a different kind of thing.
*  Yes. How many different kinds of things are you aware of?
*  Well, those are ours to if you look at the go fast, it kind of looks like a tic tac.
*  So you could say those two are the same. I think there's other stuff out there.
*  You know, and sometimes it's not that the you got to look at where where do you obtain the video?
*  It's just like intelligence, you know, and I'll use because I know you got that picture of Pablo
*  out there. You know, and there was the guy Tom Cruise made the movie about him. What's his name,
*  Louisiana dude who was flying the drugs for Pablo in and out. Barry Seal, Barry Seal. You know,
*  hey, it was all great until Reagan posted that picture that they had the cameras inside the
*  cargo plane. And then Pablo puts the guy the only place that picture came from is Barry Seals
*  airplane, you know, and then now Barry Seals a dead man. So you got to watch when you release
*  because you go, hey, we got this video, but it was taken someplace we probably weren't supposed
*  to be. Or how did they get that video? Right? Like I'll look the video of our the tic tac video.
*  That thing first came out. It's kind of funny. The guy that was in my backseat had sent me an
*  email and this is about probably 2008. So I was retired. And he sent me this video, you say
*  skippers, this look familiar. And it was on strange land calm and not suitable for work.
*  To say that, but I look and then next thing you know, it's on YouTube. So when I would tell this
*  story to my friends, I would go, I'd send them a link to the YouTube video. And this is years
*  before the New York Times article. And then when they did the unofficial official report, the
*  video was taken down off of YouTube. And you know, it kind of puzzled me like, why did you take the
*  video down? And I told the guys when they did the unofficial official product, so what you really
*  need to look at is how did this thing come off of a classified drive system on an aircraft carrier
*  and end up on strange land calm and YouTube, because at the time the videos were classified
*  secret. And that's not because it was a UFO. It's the the AT FLIR video, they did not want that
*  released. So you'd see it on CNN, they blocked out all the performance stuff, what the airplane was
*  actually doing. In this case, you know, the one you see, it's 250 knots of the autopilot on. So
*  it's not that big of a deal. But, you know, Jeremy, how many different types of vehicles are you aware
*  of that have been reported credible reports for decades, hundreds of different shapes, even
*  Lazar himself said he saw, you know, nine different styles, all working off the same propulsion system,
*  the tic tac shape, you know, vehicle that that goes back in history, some people say cigar shaped,
*  you know, big ships, small ships, we you know, they're all different kinds. I think it's important
*  to state though, there are other funded government funded UFO programs. It's a misnomer, actually,
*  that a tip was the recipient of the $22 million was actually Harry Reid created a program called
*  OSAP. OSAP was the sole beneficiary of that 22 million New York Times got it wrong.
*  And then what happened is a tip was a different funded program to study military encounters with
*  UFOs. OSAP was created because of skinwalker ranch, a government program to study UFOs and
*  associated phenomenon, a tip and OSAP communicated and shared information, but they were independently
*  funded. So the $22 million was for OSAP. And then a tip had its own sources. And then they
*  did collaborate two UFO programs. There are more that I think we're going to learn about.
*  So the different shapes that Bob Lazar saw, there was nine different shapes that he
*  saw inside of his hands. Only one up close. Yeah. And none of them were like the tic tac.
*  Not specifically. However, that's not an uncommon. If you go back in history of like military
*  sightings of craft going maybe over 20,000 miles an hour, the tic tac is a shape. They have
*  triangles. They have ones that look like rectangles. The thing that is common with all of them
*  is the non-reactionary propulsion system. I think even Commander Fravor said the thing noticed him
*  was words he first said to me and kind of went towards him with its nose, but it could move in
*  any direction, right? I mean, it could just move at will. However, when we first saw it, it was just
*  basically it never turned. It was just going left, right, kind of doing this. Shape probably
*  doesn't matter. And then it became aware because it turned and it actually mirrored what I was
*  doing. When I was coming down, it came up. And so it was obviously new we were there. And I don't
*  know if it was picking up energy coming off the airplane or what. I do know that when they tried
*  to lock it, it actively, it jammed a radar, made it pretty much useless. And Chad was pretty good
*  about kicking it over and grabbing that video. So it's pretty wild. It's a big deal to actively
*  jam a radar of ours, you know? Yeah. It's, you know, whenever someone tells you an awesome story,
*  it's great to hear, but God, I wish I saw it myself. You know, it's like this thing. It's like,
*  you're telling me and I'm like, wow, I'm listening. I'm trying to imagine. I'm putting it in my head.
*  I'm visualizing it, but damn, I wish I could see it. Yeah. I said this to a guy where he's pretty
*  prominent. I don't say who it was or what his position was. He's pretty prominent in the UFO
*  community. I'm not really a UFO guy. And he starts quoting, like Jeremy, can he quote events? So this
*  was this, this event, that event, that event. He keeps looking at me and he goes, well, do you know
*  about this event? I go, nope. And he goes, what about this event? I go, nope. He gets like three
*  of them. And I look at him and he goes, well, you're not a UFO guy. I go, no, but I chased one.
*  Have you? And he goes, no, I go, I'm an expert. He kind of got deflated a little bit because he
*  looked at me like, you suck. Well, it's like people that are into baseball stats, but they've never
*  played. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you gotta get, you gotta get your hands dirty. Get out in the field.
*  I'm with you, Joe. Like I wish I had seen it. I've been so curious about the propulsion system
*  since Lazar. I wish I could see something too. Oh my God. Yeah. I would give so much.
*  I'd almost think about running for president just to win, just so I could get in and find out about
*  UFOs. Everybody's tried. And then go, I quit, bitch. Everybody tried though, man. Clinton tried. He
*  tried to get... Did he? Oh, big time. That was his, he came in, he said, first thing, Webster Hubble,
*  he said, I want to know two things. Who killed JFK? And I want to know all about UFOs. And he
*  was denied access. And he later said, it's not the first time I've been lied to or denied information
*  after asking for it. Bill Clinton said that. Additionally, Jimmy Carter, he said before he
*  was president, I'm going to find out. Well, Jimmy Carter supposedly saw you. He did. He said,
*  I'm going to find out. I'm going to tell you. Never talked about it again afterwards. After he
*  became president, wonder what his briefing looked like. You know, and then so many presidents have
*  tried because they're like us, man. They're curious. However, this information from my
*  understanding, which is an informed understanding, is so compartmentalized. Yeah.
*  That makes sense. But listen, is there anything else? Just one thing. I want to make sure to
*  brief you on Storm because I still blame you for it a little bit. Can I do that? It's not my idea.
*  No, no. It's not my idea. Can I just give you honestly, quick break now? Okay. So check this
*  out. I made a movie, Bob Lazar, Air 51, and Flying Saucers. Joe blows it up. I go on a show with Bob
*  Lazar, which was awesome. Thanks for letting Bob tell everybody what happened. My pleasure.
*  And then the world lit on fire. Now from a sociological,
*  pop culture standpoint, what happened on that day is huge. And I don't want it to be missed on
*  anybody. So a kid watches your podcast, watches the movie, puts up this Facebook page, Storm Air 51.
*  Oh my God. That's a big problem, right? So ended up talking to the kid and all this and
*  helping, trying to help him navigate. Kid went left. He should have gone straight. Anyway,
*  vent went down. Rachel, Nevada, where area 51 is where the access points go up. We all went out
*  there, right? But really, Rachel, nobody wanted people to come. It's a town of 52 people,
*  one business. The residents, I live in Pioneer Town California, it's tiny. You don't want your
*  whole town taken over by potentially dangerous millions of people that are signing up for this
*  on Facebook, right? So it's this huge phenomenon that happened because of going on-
*  What happened?
*  So here's what actually happened because the media has completely lied to you.
*  They said 150 people showed up.
*  Yeah. It's a total fabrication out of the footage to prove it. We had an event in,
*  I participated in an event in HICO, Nevada, which is safely 50 miles away from Rachel,
*  where they didn't want us. And on the fly, 3000 plus, to me, it's a huge win. 3000 plus people,
*  even though they were scared to come because they were told to be scared to come out there,
*  that it's going to be a riot. And they peacefully assembled and enjoyed this thing I had.
*  But what happened? There's nothing. They just got together, 3000 people.
*  Yeah, but everybody came with the idea that they're curious about this. It engaged a whole
*  new audience of people. We had Dave Foley talked. We had Paul Oakenfold, some famous-
*  People talked? Do you have a microphone set up?
*  Yeah. I set it up. I brought in speakers.
*  Dave, did you avoid this?
*  Yeah, I'm not, you know, I'm a military guy. I'm not storming a government. That's about the
*  stupidest thing I've ever heard. Let's go. That's like, let's all jump the White House fence. I'm
*  like, are you wacky? That's the dumbest idea on the planet.
*  Yeah, I didn't understand the benefit of getting all those people together.
*  No, no, people were going. And so my point was, well, let's at least bring people who can talk
*  about it and have a civilized fun time and see what people want to do. So my point is,
*  it's amazing anybody came out to begin with and nobody went crazy.
*  So what is the 150 people that were reported? Where did they go?
*  Maybe at the gate itself to go see-
*  So that's probably what would have happened if someone like you didn't come along and organize
*  something else.
*  Yeah, I didn't organize it, but I definitely advocated for safety and it worked and it was
*  a success.
*  So they just got together and talked. 3,000 people got together and talked.
*  Well, it was spread out all throughout. Like people didn't, Rachel, the community didn't
*  want people. There was an event there though. And in Heiko where I was, was the event with
*  the stage and the fun stuff we all did. George Knapp was there as well.
*  How'd you promote this?
*  Well, they did the event, they promoted it because people were already coming.
*  Did you promote it on social media?
*  Oh, sure. I said, if you're going to go somewhere, that's where I'm going to be and it's going
*  to be safe and sane. My point is this, you have so many people that are curious now and
*  don't underestimate what happened when someone watched your podcast and that happened. Boom,
*  you've got all these new people who are interested in it. And I think that's important because this
*  UFO phenomenon is real. You've got fighter pilots that engage them. It represents a non-reactionary
*  propulsion system. And that's a physics that would change the world. So the more people that
*  come together and say, we're interested, the louder the voice we got. I think it's cool.
*  And I had some alien Budweiser. Great.
*  Well, I don't know if there's really any benefit to people physically getting together,
*  but I do think that there's a lot of benefit. I'm glad you had a good time, but I do think
*  there's a lot of benefit to this discussion. And I really think there's a lot of benefit to
*  hearing the stories from people like you because that's the only thing that matters to me.
*  It's like, I need to know the person who's telling me the story isn't full of shit.
*  So when I get it from someone like you, I really, really appreciate it. So that's it. Thanks for
*  being here. Thanks for telling your story. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being you.
*  Thank you, Jeremy, for setting this up. And thanks for your documentary on Bob as well,
*  which really like fucking turned me around. Thanks, man.
*  That was the one. All right. That's it. Bye, everybody.
*  Whoo.
