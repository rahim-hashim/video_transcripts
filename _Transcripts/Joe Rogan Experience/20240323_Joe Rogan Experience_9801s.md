*  You're good.
*  It's okay.
*  It's nice to see the tweet and how the folks about their fucking magic.
*  Skanks for the Memories is still one of my all-time favorite comedy athrons.
*  It's a fucking classic.
*  It's weird when you ... I'm sure you have this where a fan comes up to you and they
*  repeat one of your most horrific jokes.
*  You know, like, hey man, those titties ain't ... I'm like, whoa!
*  Say it in a corner.
*  Not here.
*  You know, what happens to me sometimes, people bring up bits that I totally forgot.
*  True.
*  I'm like, oh my god, how does that go?
*  I have to ask them.
*  How does that go?
*  Oh, yeah!
*  I remember that.
*  What was it on?
*  Yep, that's what it is, man.
*  Blur, but we're old. Yeah, David. We're old now. I am very I was my mom's been the hospital, right?
*  I went in there and people thought I was the patient. I was sitting in the room with her and they kept coming over
*  I'm like her
*  I wish it was a joke
*  I've known you for at least 30 years for sure. Well, it looks better on you than on me. That's for sure
*  That's why I brought in my my intern. Yeah, take some of the slack up. Wait, you guys are the same age
*  Yeah, I'm older than you. I'm older than you. How old are you? 59? I'm 56. Okay. There you go. See? Yeah
*  Yeah, three years ago. I look like that
*  No, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. It's all about the maintenance
*  Well, yeah, you put the time and you gotta keep that maintenance. Oh, I saw it coming a long time ago, though
*  I saw it coming like in my 30s. Yeah, but you never were like this. I mean like you never know
*  I never let myself go. Yeah, I never let myself go. I'm terrified of it. Really? Yeah, because I've been injured before
*  I've had a bunch of surgeries. I know what it's like to like have things not work good
*  I'm like, oh you got to do everything you can to make sure the fucking wheels are still on the machine
*  Yeah, if you don't you know, we all know guys who like Patrice we lost Patrice
*  Yeah, we all know guys who don't take care of themselves and fucking shits just starts breaking. What do you think stop falling apart?
*  I'm glad you brought up Patrice because we've lost a lot of greats
*  Patrice is the one a lot of people like, you know super fans always bring up Patrice
*  What would he do in the age of ozempic? What do you think?
*  I don't think he would go along with it. I could see him putting it on like a like a cheeseburger
*  You know he just was not he's not into it fuck Eric category
*  He's not gonna do it like Bryan Simpson got on it for a little while was terrible for him
*  Really a terrible reaction Wow, and that was and I taught those guys how to eat better
*  I'm like just stop eating all the bullshit and you'd be amazed at how much better you feel
*  What do you think is bullshit like in these bread and carbs?
*  Not all carbs like it's it's not like vegetables are fantastic for you
*  I'm not a prop I'm not one of those people that thinks that you should be on any
*  Particular diet because I think diets are different for every person some people
*  Vegetarian vegan they're fine. Some people they fall apart
*  It's you got to figure out what the fuck is right for you. But for everybody, yeah sugar. Hmm, everybody
*  It's even sweetener no good well like artificial sweet now, yeah that kills a year fucking pussy
*  Diet coke takes you out
*  on stevia
*  I'm not flit as I with all I
*  Think I think that it's fucking pasta and bread for a lot of people. I know it is for me
*  I over consume calories when I eat that stuff. Yeah, because it's just it's so
*  Wonderful to stuff in your fat face
*  When's the last time you had a piece of cake just like I'll do it every now and then
*  Once a week or something like that. I give myself a day where I don't give a shit. I'll eat pizza
*  What is carb a loader? Aren't you supposed to do a bunch of that before you do like a race or you ride? Yeah
*  Yeah, that's a lot of guys do that
*  That you'd have to talk to like endurance athletes about that
*  Essentially they're just like taking in a lot of carbohydrates before like ultra marathons and things like that
*  And then they also have gels they have these carb gels. They'll squirt in their mouth. Oh, wow running
*  Yeah, they're just all about performance those those folks are all about. Yeah, trying to squeeze out another two or three minutes in a
*  100 mile race. Oh, that's crazy. I ride a bike in New York City. So I eat a ton of pasta and I'm riding three miles
*  I'm like I got a car below
*  But that's a fucking workout though boy that's so good for your health except for the fact that you're breathing in brake dust
*  Oh, I think that's the least of it in New York. Oh, yeah, it's kind of like it's kind of like
*  You're driving through like a zombie horde, you know, it's like
*  Homeless dust you're peddling and you're also kind of basically like away. Oh, yeah thought about wearing like armor. Yeah
*  George and the light brigade I have used my bike chain as like a mace
*  Yeah, he's got some great tangles
*  Oh, yeah, I mean you gotta learn sometimes you have to pop off because cars will turn and they act like you don't exist
*  So you got to like yell and everything right and a lot of these guys especially since the pandemic is everything's food delivery
*  So they all go down the wrong way. They're all buzzing around you on the side
*  It's terrible and this guy this guy called me on a bad one
*  I was having a bad day and he was coming at me
*  I was like wrong way asshole and he came up got in front of me stopped and was like asshole
*  You're an asshole and he smacked my coffee out of my hand a white guy. Yeah
*  That's other draw really gave it away
*  Someone from the Bronx over to be like fair enough
*  Sir, I'm wrong. So he climbed out smacked your coffee. Oh, yeah, and I spit in his face and
*  He and then I got I went down and then he came up again and took his phone out and
*  Started to tape me and I was like, you're a fucking pussy you fucking snitch and I took my chain
*  I was like you want to be fucking tough. Let's be tough
*  And he was crazy and I rode away and I went welcome to New York. There's all crowded people watching
*  That's coming from the guy who just saw Ghostbusters. How many times?
*  This guy's a Ghostbuster not yeah, he's a fanatic
*  He was probably coached if anyone gives you hard time you film. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shame. Yeah
*  You don't like immigrants. Oh, yeah. Well now he was French. So
*  Becky but he was French. Yeah, but you got to be careful fighting people from other countries. They play by different rules. That's true
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know you're with a guy you're tangling and also he pulls out a snake
*  I
*  Got a poisonous wiper on me
*  You know tell me that this guy I knew from Malaysia
*  He said, you know in Malaysia, you know
*  You go to a bar and these guys have these rings that are dipped in poison
*  So like, you know, you'd be with the guy and all sudden he'll like on the back like like that
*  No, what was that like a pinprick and then you're dead like a day later. No, it's a Malaysian. Hello
*  Like those spheres shit in Vietnam something like that
*  You could probably survive the spear dipped in shit before you could survive the poison
*  Yeah, but I was like in Malaysia Wow tough. It's a tough tough scene over there
*  Well, Ian is you know, what was gonna say like we've been working together for a long time
*  Yeah, and he's sober too, you know, so I'm sorry
*  This is kind of like a bore but um, you know, the sober life on the road is not very cool
*  You know the chain smoking and the coffee. That's pretty much it. We go on adventures
*  We do daytime sober adventures think it would be like sober no coffee. No, I can tell you right now
*  My plane was delayed and I hadn't had a coffee in 12 hours. I got that weird headache, you know
*  I'm talking about it was like like it from from the front all the way to the back and I was like that's coffee withdrawal
*  Yeah, we also don't drink water. Yeah waters for yeah. No, I drink coffee pretty much
*  Yeah, I have to rehydration is my yeah. I'm like, here's a water David. Yeah
*  Doesn't want it. Oh my god, it's really yeah. Yeah, that's like the the least you can do for your body
*  And I'm like, nah, I don't think so. Well those connecting flights are hell when you can't smoke cigarettes
*  Yeah, it's like an eight-hour connecting flight. Then you get a smoke in the family bathroom at the airport
*  There's only one airport where you can smoke and that's Vegas. I think is that the only one that it has that weird
*  Yeah, like that's coffin room. Yeah that kind of
*  Shame you or two. I don't know. That is the wildest thing they ever did give you a box where you could do drugs in
*  Get in there. Yeah, cuz it's gonna fuck up everybody else. So get in there
*  You don't fuck it up a little bit. He'll live it up rat
*  Well, the crazy things used to be able to smoke on the fucking plane. Yes
*  I remember it clearly when I was a kid dice used to have a bit about it the smoking section
*  It's all the same man
*  They they had a fucking smoking section
*  Yeah, try doing that joke today people like what so I'm not playing even smoking jokes people like what are you talking around?
*  Yeah, I thought smoking was back
*  I thought all the scene stars the the posers are into smoking cigarettes now because vaping became too mainstream
*  I thought that they that's what I've heard in New York like smoking in a restaurant smoking in a bar somewhere
*  Just have like it's kind of like a retro kind of a look how cool I am
*  Well, it's trading the moment for the future true. That is true, but I was just in a hospital with old people
*  There's not much you want that moment
*  You trade that moment for like a decay yeah certain amount of decay you're gonna experience in your future. Yeah, I'll take it
*  You got to live in the moment
*  Sure until you can't well
*  I'm telling you I was just around a lot of old people like the woman next to my mom in the hospital 100 years old
*  No, and she was no Betty White by the way all right. It was like we peeked through the curtain
*  It's like hi, and it was just like eyes over a oxygen mask glaring at us like whoa, okay, we get it
*  I'll see you at the hardware store in heaven
*  But you're gonna live forever, I mean we all know that that's not possible come on no one's living forever well
*  But my goal is just to stay healthy
*  You keep it make sure it moves good would you eventually segue like from like like a less?
*  Strenuous workout you know I'm saying like when you get older not once I have to like a Tai Chi in a park nothing like that
*  Tai Chi in a park makes it look like you read a lot
*  You know you're like really into esoteric things true you're out there moving slow in the park doing it
*  an ancient kung fu
*  In New York that's called methadone people like in their own like world I used to go to this pool hall and
*  The methadone clinic was right down the street and so my friend Johnny's call him the methadone ins
*  They get their dose and they just come in and play pool
*  That's perfect for sure they were high yeah
*  No, yes idea that methadone is like that's what stops you from using heroin right right, but it also gets you high
*  Yeah, yeah, I know guys are addicted to methadone mm-hmm and
*  What was gonna say that you can take with just a pill right isn't that what that is you can drink it too again
*  Yeah, wow
*  And it's and the suboxone is the same thing
*  I come in and explain that on the podcast once he actually ran a clinic
*  Oh one point in time, and he was explaining how they're just getting you hooked on these other things
*  And these other things also get you high yeah, yeah, have you done it before now suboxone? No no
*  But I mean it's it's just like I've heard mixed reviews though some people say it doesn't do that to you
*  Well, I mean it's like whatever gets you off the thing that's killing you you know it's like harm reduction
*  But eventually you got to get off that if you want to be like totally sober
*  And is that methadone is just as bad if not worse for you really I don't think it's good for you
*  I mean my cousin's on it. She's doing great
*  I think Dr.
*  Well there you go
*  Told me I think that if you know that the problem with fucking any opiates is it's you your body develops a tolerance
*  Yeah, and then you go rush limbaugh. Yeah, rush was taking like
*  99 pills a day or so wow yeah really get from it supposedly Jesus Christ
*  I didn't know that
*  By them you know you know just like excellent sudden broadcasting
*  I just imagined him just fucking blasted out of his mind wandering around his yelling the most horrific things
*  Opiates yeah, you know wow the light rubber band around his balls
*  Out to lunch painkillers may have caused limbaugh's deafness
*  Didn't know that could a common painkiller if taken in massive quantities by the way
*  contributed to rush limbaugh's well-known hearing loss
*  Research findings suggest that the radio talk show hosts apparent addiction to Vicodin could be the culprit behind his mysterious
*  Attack of deafness two years ago doctors over the past several years reported dozens of cases of Vicodin addicts who become deaf and in some cases
*  Only regained their hearing with the help of cochlear implants such as the one
*  Received by limbaugh. It's pretty clear that there's an association says dr.
*  Jeffrey Harris an ear specialist the University of California San Diego Medical School the ear is sensitive to drugs and this particular association with Vicodin
*  Has become more relevant as people are getting their hands on it as a recreational drug
*  How many did he take at the height of his pilliness?
*  Find that because I think it was really nutty. I think and I was up to like I think he was in the 90s
*  In a week and I was flying high I took it imagine it
*  I believe it was Vicodin that I took once when I had knee surgery
*  I mean, it was I was like I'd rather be in pain like I feel so
*  Stupid yeah, but then I had a buddy mine
*  It was a musician and he said he would take it and it would really help with his creativity when he's writing song really
*  Wow sounds like an excuse, but it's I think it's a thing
*  It's will definitely a crutch right, but I think it's a thing where it's like different for different people like for something like for Stan
*  Hope weed is horrific. Yeah, no, it's not we got yeah, you can't do it. Yeah, he's an og drunk, right?
*  Yeah, me weed is like this is wonderful. I love it. Yeah, everything's great, but I just think it's I think the
*  Diversity of like how the the difference is in people's like just chemistry
*  It's very
*  Under-appreciated in terms of tolerance to food in terms of you know, how much exercise
*  What kind of diseases you're gonna get like this? It's biodiversity man. We're gonna try it to find out
*  Yeah, we're all fucking different like any one size fits all get the fuck out of here with that
*  That that doesn't work with people were so different
*  What else like a bunch of different species is all smushed up together?
*  Yeah, when I had a shoulder surgery they gave me a pain blocker have you have one of those no it like lasts about
*  12 hours and it just blocks the
*  Hasn't that gotten recreational because it was like awesome. It's like I was walking around like I don't feel like
*  Epidural were they going to your spine? Is that what you're saying? No, no, they just put something like on it
*  Oh, I think or no. No, no, you're right. It was in me and then it dissolved or something like that
*  No with an epidural they it's like a spine block, okay
*  So they do it's like if you want to be conscious like I was conscious when I got my knee operated on so they basically
*  Paralyzed me below the waist Wow, that's scary. It was wild. Why would you want that?
*  I wanted to see it because I wanted to see what the surgery looked like I wanted to see my knee being pulled apart
*  Oh screw it in together. I wanted it like they said I could watch it. Couldn't you just watch it later? No, no, no
*  Well, this is
*  Whatever it was and so, you know, I said what are the options and the doctor said well most people we just put them under
*  I go
*  But why would you not put them under and he said because if sometimes people want to be awake and I said well
*  What happens if you're awake like can I watch and he's like, yeah, I go. Okay, let's do that
*  I want to see it so you could talk and everything while you were doing it. Yeah, I could Wow
*  And you didn't feel any panic. Mm-hmm. No, it was interesting
*  Because it didn't I didn't feel any pain so I was watching the doctor screw it in and hammer it and fucking oh man
*  I was like woof did it at any point where you like am I dead? No, no, no doctor was awesome
*  It wasn't out of body. No, no, no because you're you're you're essentially sitting there
*  I think I think the way I was seeing it was on a monitor if I remember correctly
*  I think there was like they had like a cotton shield in front of me and my legs were there and
*  Then I was looking up at a monitor
*  Remember correctly, it's a long time ago. It's hard to remember
*  I didn't get I remember him manipulating my leg and moving it around
*  It was fucked. I didn't have an ACL
*  So they had to and it's this pretty serious operation because they have to take a piece of your patellar
*  tendon with a chunk of bone from your shin and a chunk of bone from your kneecap and they pull that out and
*  Then they put it inside your knee and screw it in place
*  Wow just the sounds alone would it creep me out it's crazy
*  Yeah, when you hear the the bone crunching because the the fucking screw is going into it. You're like
*  And then afterwards he's manipulating it to like afterwards I was watching him move it around and what was the recovery on that?
*  Like how long it took a long time? I'm sure yeah, that's a long one because it's there's so much trauma going on there
*  I think that took like a year before my knee felt normal the knee is harder than the shoulder right?
*  No, the shoulders are very hard because the shoulder moves all over the place. Oh, okay
*  This is the only thing I could find he had when he was arrested. They've had over two three two thousand plus
*  painkillers in his
*  in his system or on a
*  Housekeeper claims that he did over 30 oxy's a day, but that's hoxies. That's not Vicodin
*  They gave me after my side I code on Laura set oh yeah, everything nor nor can or you know a few things oh
*  Which could hydrocodone can cause hearing loss it says
*  Wow imagine like what a pill free what a hell that is to when you're a guy who has headphones on for a living
*  Like he and you are your pill thing is so wacky. He can't stop it's so wacky
*  You can't stop to the point where your your fucking hearing goes away. Yeah, now you feel your job
*  Good just with that oxy itch and everything and then one day you can't hear what a nightmare
*  But he's probably got like five doctors to write those scripts like that cuz I mean honestly isn't it illegal so like well
*  He was living in Florida
*  That's a great doc
*  The guys were making all that money just selling like fake. You know like it was just like anybody people coming in at Kentucky
*  Hey, I got a I got a bursitis. Okay. Here you go. That's my friend Mariana van Zeller
*  She it's the oxycontin Express that that lady that lady's a gangster
*  But she exposed the whole thing where they don't have a database yeah go from one place
*  They're basically pain management centers. Do you remember though? Yeah, it's all done now crazy
*  Okay, mr. Limbaugh, and I have maintained from the start that there was no doctor shopping
*  And when we continue to hold this position, that's mr. Black said I love how he says that
*  Just that way like he's giving up the fact that he's playing a game. We continue to hold this position
*  Wow, you're playing chess game
*  You're literally like saying it and what you're saying there's no doctor shopping
*  I don't know what you're talking about
*  But maybe back like he had to be doing this for years and years and years
*  He's getting 2,000 yes, you're going doctor shopping. Are you buying it from a drug dealer? It's one of those two options
*  Yeah, we have endless money. Yeah
*  He was a doctor so what do we do is you go to the the pain management center?
*  Yeah, go and you say I'm in pain
*  And they go oh we'll write your prescription for drugs and you go right next door to the pharmacy that only sells
*  Oxycontin
*  Oxycontin Express they just buy them from one doctor and go to another doctor and they just get bags of pills fill the trunk up
*  Kentucky yeah, and it was off 95 so they would just go from Florida up to Philly Delaware, New York
*  Oh, how many cars made that trip before they started figuring out what was going right and the pharmaceutical drug companies knew it
*  So they just kept selling it. Oh, yeah, they were there was some nutty
*  Statistic at one point in time where Florida had like 1,000 times more
*  The world I make that number up
*  But it was some nutty number where you're like what in fucking God's name are you people doing?
*  How is that not like an anomaly it just shows up like this one state has a yeah out of prescription
*  Yeah, like is there some pain in that state?
*  We got the blues
*  Kentucky bluegrass
*  No, but I like the parking lot. Did you see in the documentary?
*  They're like the most like vagrant like just like redneck just like just basically screeching around
*  Yeah, and then the doctors themselves were armed because they're so afraid, you know, like those doctors are dealing with zombies
*  Yeah, somebody runs dry money and no one wants their dick sucked. Mm-hmm. You're gonna get jumped
*  I mean definitely on the way out. It's like an in-and-out in Oakland. I mean, it's anybody's
*  They would have in I there's a book called dreamland that talks about
*  The pill crisis and everything and how it started with black tar heroin coming in from Naira at Mexico and everything and
*  There were houses in Ohio that people would line up with stolen goods and trade like chainsaws for pills
*  And then they would take those goods from Home Depot and like sell them back to make more money to buy pills
*  My god
*  Kapil economy, I don't know what to say, you know, there's there's more than the wrong many wars connected to that too
*  Yeah
*  Conspiracies about Vietnam always had something to do with with heroin and the conspiracy about Afghanistan Oh with the opium
*  Dude, we were guarding
*  Opium fields. Yeah, we were guarding poppy fields the United States troops were guarding poppy fields and they had
*  Geraldo Rivera go over there to Gaslight America about it and they played it on TV now
*  Tell me why are you guarding this heroin?
*  But they have to guard the heroin otherwise the local people won't like us
*  Yeah, oh, what's he saying that they did back to you?
*  That they do it from the Taliban or something like that was like well that was how like they
*  What's the truth and what's the story are two very different things there was fucking selling heroin
*  Heroin production went up after we invaded by some fucking insane number
*  Yeah, that's not like a shine then these guys like we need you to guard this heroin
*  So you like us we're here to guard it. So they send fucking soldiers over there to guard heroin
*  Yeah, you get a roll of his big fucking silly smile. Hi everybody in a war with a big smile
*  This he's trying to this smile is to let everybody know that everything's fine
*  This is nothing to be concerned with and this is right around the time when opium and Oxycontin was just flowing
*  Even the way he's like performatively shaking this guy excited in front of the camera
*  Like he hasn't met this guy before the whole thing is such a fucking charade
*  fighting the opium trade by guarding the heroin
*  They
*  Imagine the fucking gaslighting
*  fighting the opium trade
*  Guarding the heroin field so that they could make heroin. Yep, the poppy fields only
*  Make heroin. They're not there's no tomatoes in there, right?
*  How how are you fighting the opium trade by guarding the heroin and ensuring the production?
*  What are you doing?
*  Hit the brakes the government became a drug dealer
*  One fucking hundred percent. There's no way they're doing that unless they're making some the alternative pumpkins. We thought maybe
*  I
*  Know how about a Christmas tree farm? I know it goes against the culture but
*  If we just tie pumpkin season, right? We're gonna make a killing boys
*  Now the Vietnam thing is interesting because I know my cousin who was in Vietnam
*  He came back and he had a heroin problem, but in actual Vietnam, they don't make heroin. It's Laos, right?
*  Yeah, it's it's a trade routes. So there you go. It's like it's in that it's in that zone that it's controlling the area
*  You know
*  Like there's so many conspiracies about what what the real reason why they lied and made up a false attack
*  To get us to go into Vietnam, but almost always it's money
*  Almost always there's no way they do anything like that unless someone's making money. That's what they did then
*  That's what they do now
*  Now if you're making money the legal ways, you know
*  They're doing selling weaponry and doing all the stuff that we do
*  But then you realize that there's all this extra money being made here that you're not getting a piece of right if there's
*  Trillions of dollars in heroin coming from a place. Yeah, you're gonna be like, hey, this is kind of bullshit
*  I'm tired of selling you fuckers tanks
*  Yeah, and that look this is like so well documented in our country that's literally what the Iran Contra affair was about
*  We funded the war the Sandinistas versus the Contras in Nicaragua, yeah, that's Oliver North
*  I mean that's fucking freeway Ricky Ross was selling them the coke. Yeah, but we have to invade them because they hate our freedom
*  What's really important is framing it in a way that the common person can understand
*  Yeah, I know this seems like tyranny to you. Yeah, and there's a bunch of fucking murderous drug dealers at the helm of the wheel
*  But that's not the case. Yeah, what about fentanyl? What do you think of that?
*  It's fucking crazy, it's crazy that's out of China, right?
*  It's that well, they need the precursors the precursors apparently are coming from China. Okay again China's like listen
*  Are they buying them? We're selling. Yeah, let's go. Is there plan to win the hundred-year war?
*  Well, there's back home. They are way ahead of schedule
*  Those guys are killing it. They're fucking killing it. They're killing it with tik-tok. I think tik-tok accelerated. Yeah, tik-tok is the new opium
*  Their tik-tok is all like, you know, it's good
*  Sexy and dance white yeah drag queens are fun
*  They must be really
*  I'm a teacher you need to know how I fuck

*  I mean, I guess you do for the expass. It's not like the locals are dying for American comedy over there
*  They will fucking put you in the ground if you talk some shit over there
*  Oh, yeah
*  No, you can't go over there and just get drunk and do comedy

*  On your side like hey, I'm in Pittsburgh. What about that? You know, it's granting. Am I right? Come on. They suck
*  I'm kidding. But uh, you know, that's the thing like who do they make fun of? I guess us that would be really it's just like
*  I'm sorry. I'm coming from America with our you know different branches of government. Well, I wish we have just one guy
*  One guy you can get shit done. Yeah
*  Yeah, you can really get that's for sure because what you do is you make sure that the businesses are on the same page as the
*  Government the government owns the businesses are all together. You're all part of it. You can't make a decision without them
*  That way we're all working in the greater good of the country
*  You can make gonna make plenty of money
*  We're all working the greater good of the country and it's a weird hybrid of communism and commerce
*  Yeah, like that's what changed when China figured out
*  Oh, no, we need to have competition so people need to be able to make money
*  Let him make money, but we'll still gonna run shit and then and then I think America was like I like what she's wearing
*  Yeah, I
*  Want to she looks good. Yeah, I want that dress. I think it's that that's what I think it is
*  And I think that's why they're fucking pushing for all this crazy shit today
*  People think they're trying really trying to make the world better for people. No, they're not shut the fuck up
*  They're trying to get more control out of you. What's your like when you go overseas?
*  Like do you perform like a tour or like what's your favorite like spot overseas? I love the UK. Yeah, I love to go over there
*  I just love the people. I just love it. They're fun. It's a fun place. I love England. I love I love Scotland

*  You know, there's a lot of America. That's like a little uptight
*  Yeah, very judgy and very uptight

*  But like good old fucking regular drunk English guys are fun. I like them. I like drunk Irish guys. They're fun
*  Ireland is good. Yeah, they're fun young people there get it young people know what the fuck is going on
*  Then the young people today are on the internet and the young people today are paying attention to people that aren't lying
*  And they realize like oh we're getting fucked. Yeah, you've been getting fucked. We were getting fucked
*  We didn't even know we were getting fucked
*  Well, I mean when you go overseas, that's the thing of like, you know, I say sort small Canada
*  You know I'm saying like you get it going
*  It's funny how like they get all of our references yet, they're better people, you know that kind of thing yeah
*  No, they're not I think they are no no percent less douchebags in Canada
*  How many fights have you seen out of Tim Hortons? That's what I want to know exactly. You never see a beatdown
*  You never see shooting
*  I went to a strip club in Calgary and they they use the loonies and toonies the coins to get the strippers
*  Right and people like when you go make sure you don't warm them up with a lighter. They don't like that. I'm like what
*  They're throwing okay throwing hot coins and strippers. These are terrible people
*  This might be what we call like sampling bias like the study
*  What kind of people Canadians are at a hole?
*  Strip club in a fucking cattle town a frozen cattle town in one of the toughest fucking places on earth to live
*  I forgot it is a cattle town
*  Yeah, I've got some friends that my friends John and Jen they live in Edmonton
*  They live out in Alberta, and it's so cold out there
*  Yeah
*  Take hot water and throw it in the air and it freezes before it hits the ground Wow, bro
*  They get to 50 below 60 below a week before I was there was negative 30 and then the week I went it was
*  32 degrees and people were like oh, I'm wearing shorts
*  Hardy yeah, that's why they're so cool up there you have to have discipline to live
*  You have to be able to shovel your car out of the fucking snow to stay alive to stay alive
*  Like it makes for better people it makes for more resilient people people are better when they know how to put on snow tires
*  Well this guy in the strip club
*  Honestly, he really I hate to think you out or anything
*  But he really like you know how like most guys go and they just kind of sit and observe
*  He's part of the action he immediately runs in throwing the dollar spanking an ass
*  I'm like I don't know if you're allowed to do that here, dude. I don't know like where you think you're like
*  He's from Delaware, so I assume that's like a hand. Yeah, it's normal. Yeah spanking a woman's ass
*  But I was like club and they liked it too. They were like oh finally a guy who gets us
*  Yeah, they were like into them
*  They want to have fun and most guys just sit there and like you know yeah
*  You went up and you put a dollar like you were
*  Exchanging I was like looking around for the cameras
*  I don't want to be observed doing this
*  But it was it was really definitely a that was for Louis Cass's bachelor half half bachelor party
*  Because I wasn't gonna go to Costa Rica with them
*  Oh
*  Down there
*  Is awesome, but yeah bugs are gigantic
*  Bro, they have crazy bugs you never seen before they're like birds really huge
*  I wouldn't be in there's out his crocodiles there. I went with my family and we went on a crocodile tour
*  It's crazy, dude. They're crocodiles, right? Oh, yeah
*  I use
*  Well, they have a crocodile. It's like rivers, and I don't know what you would call it
*  I guess you could call it a bayou
*  I think by who's like an American term isn't a French term yes, it is French term use for Cajun country CCR term yeah
*  But so we're in this boat right and my kids are young at the time
*  And I'm like don't go near there don't go there like every time they go near the edge
*  One of them is a little daredevil and she likes to like like lean over the edge like come on you fucking thrill seeker
*  These are real dinosaurs man, and so we watch this one slide into the water
*  So there's a bunch of them on the deck on the the bank rather and they're sunning themselves
*  And you see these 15 feet crocodiles just sunning themselves
*  They like this is so creepy, and then they slide into the water like Jesus
*  They're under us. They're in the fight. You're in the boat, and I'm like this is such a bad idea
*  All my father instincts are kicking in like
*  You know like you like road rage times a hundred you look
*  Fucking freaking man if one of them falls, and you're gonna go in you have to go in you have to go in
*  Yeah, leave them you have to go in and you have to throw them onto the fucking boat
*  Get up because the crocodile is gonna hear the splashing oh
*  Jesus wow so scary
*  How about the about the ocean there too, that's another one where it's like amazing, but there's a lot of shark
*  Oh, they're sharks down. That's what I heard
*  Shark Florida they down in the Keys
*  They have so many bull sharks that there's a bunch of videos of guys
*  Fishing and they're just trying to get the fish in as quick as they can because the bull sharks come along
*  I mean, it just fuck those fish up Wow
*  There's bull sharks everywhere down there so many that you're allowed to kill them and cook them
*  Really yeah, you can go bull shark fish. You can go bull shark fishing in the Keys in Florida
*  What does that taste like how many are you?
*  How many bull sharks you allowed to take I think you love to take like one a year or something like that
*  But people go fishing for bull sharks how big do they get and people get mad at them?
*  They're killing shark because the propaganda of the fucking shark spin soup
*  Don't understand the size of the globe and they think that sharks are endangered, but not there
*  No, they might not be over there
*  Wherever the fuck they've been killing them and taking their fins off, but in Florida
*  There's a lot of them does it fuck up the ecosystem though if they kill too many of them sure yeah
*  But we're killing too many fish yeah
*  The problem is it's not just we mean we the human race where we've depleted the ocean by something around
*  90% of all the fish and then they told us that plastic straws are the problem so every time I go to a coffee shop
*  It sucks ass here. It is bull sharks are harvestable in Florida with a 54 inch minimum size limit and one per person per day
*  Oh, I want a day day. That's how many they have of them the world record is from Stewart, Florida with
*  501 pounds 92 inches
*  Yikes the maximum size is about 13 feet with the matures at approximately 14 to 18 years of age
*  Wow teenager, but they're not bull sharks are responsible for almost all of the different shark attacks out there
*  Wow like to bump and bite meaning they bump their prey and attack it while it's trying to figure out what just hit them
*  Just like you Ian
*  Bump it bite
*  These cut stingrays for bait year-round and our heaviest rods and tackle gear
*  No doubt you'll get a great show and fight if you catch a bull shark
*  Would you ever go to a shark session?
*  I'm not a fishing guy, but I wish I was into that like I like all the gear they have to buy
*  Like that we go into like a dick's and you see like that old wall for like, you know
*  The right anglers and all that kind of the lures and all that kind of the I don't know
*  But I'm not you wouldn't go I would go but I'm not really try it fishing
*  This is one of the things they just Jamie just pointed out one of the crazy things about bull sharks
*  They go into freshwater. Oh, so they can go they've been all the way up into Illinois
*  No bullshit
*  That explains it
*  Even the movie Jaws was based on a freshwater attack that was on a river in that's right. Yeah now near Tom's River
*  They go all the way up the river into the they can how can they do that?
*  What a fresh and so as a monsters Wow
*  They're just designed to kill and they ran out of shit to kill on the salt. They ventured into the fresh
*  That's amazing. We made it all the way up into the rivers and they started killing things
*  What are they? What do they look like the shark like a regular shark like a great white type?
*  Smaller than that smaller. Yeah, they're smaller, but it's the same kind of look
*  That's what a bull shark looks like. Yeah, so my god look at that terrifying fuckhead
*  Christ dude, that's like the classic look
*  How many there must be if they let you kill one a day sure do you know how many there must be that's yeah
*  It's great news. How many people are going out specifically?
*  Like how much bull sharks there's videos on YouTube of guys doing it
*  Yeah, they have like YouTube fishing channels
*  These fucking dudes go down there, and they catch bull sharks. I mean see if you could find like bull shark fishing
*  Warmer sea surface temperatures have led to a bull shark population increase scientists say Wow in wildlife expert discusses
*  Whether people should take caution yeah, they're gonna kill you
*  Take a lot of fucking caution these fuckers are dangerous
*  Oh, that's it. They're real aggressive, too. I think them and tiger sharks no sharks. I think of the most
*  What's it say Jamie? You want bull shark video fishing? Yeah bull shark fishing. I want to see the Illinois
*  Bull shark fishing scene
*  People have it in their head like oh you shouldn't kill sharks right?
*  But you also shouldn't let them kill people right like so many fucking sharks to kill people you got to kill the sharks
*  Yeah, but it's also like we shouldn't be eating tuna and salmon with everything that rotation
*  Fuckin shark, bro
*  I want a shark steak, bro
*  You used to be able to buy it everywhere Mako shark was like a normal thing that was on menus
*  Growing up on Long Island. That was the big you know the big get a Mako
*  Two bull sharks swam up to Mississippi River to st. Louis
*  Wow yeah, see the arch
*  That's that's how resilient they are
*  1937 sparked a fisherman's tail from 1937 sparked the researchers interest in bull sharks
*  upstream after two fishermen caught a five foot 84 pound bull shark in Alton, Illinois, so that was
*  in
*  1937 58 years later in 1995 a fisherman near Rush Island, Missouri caught another bull shark
*  That's fucking what are you eating? What everything?
*  What are you eating what everything Wow fucking everything birds whoever's yes
*  Whoever's slipping bitch. Oh man bull sharks typically live in warm water in open salt water
*  But they are one of the few species that can adapt to live in freshwater environments
*  Do they ever have arguments and they go after each other I wonder I?
*  Think sharks eat each other yeah sure yeah
*  I'm sure they do for sure well. They kill everything else battlebots of the sea. That would be great fucking monsters, man
*  That's awesome. I mean their teeth are just rows and rows of like
*  Duplicating teeth so when one falls out another one replaces it
*  This is so different from the stuff
*  I look at at home like when I'm like I'm like a koi pond like there's something about a koi pod
*  Like it calms me down. I don't know what it is videos
*  Walter anything with parrots you know I was into that I like that too
*  Yeah, I like this what I was thinking of doing like you take
*  Like you know there's all these parrots that outlive their owners, so you take them and you make like a supreme court of parrots
*  They know all this ancient stuff because they're like old like this you put little robes on them
*  It's like hey, what do you guys think about and you say an issue and then like whatever it's like okay?
*  Well there you go. That's what we should do
*  Parrots live super old. I know like 70 years or something really crazy, so if you get one when you're 80 you're an asshole
*  You really are so selfish
*  You know this poor parrot especially treat it well
*  Imagine handing a parrot down to your children in the will yeah
*  I think they can live to like a hundred years old
*  I'm not sure like a tortoise like they have that kind of age to them
*  They really can live a long time
*  There's a few animals where like once you get them as a pet you know you're there
*  And it is for your kids and do they keep learning phrases. No I think they kind of like just know like three things
*  Some pets such as tortoises and parrots may live for over 50
*  Well you know tortoises live like into their hundreds so
*  Provide documented pens for their pet parrots in their wills yeah
*  lawyers often urge pet parents
*  Lawyers that's his lawyers weaseling in on time a pet parent money attorney
*  That's a leap of faith like cuz I just did a will like and to my parrot. I'd like you know it's like yeah
*  We're gonna do that
*  Yeah, this parrot can you can talk, but he can't you know testify
*  Some species yes 75 to 100 years. Oh wow wow you got to go with an old-fashioned pigeon
*  That's like what three weeks like six weeks if he's healthy
*  Do you know the pigeons were all brought over here for food? No I didn't know that I thought they were from here
*  No, no, they're an invasive species. I guess they were brought over from Europe, but they there were a food source
*  That's what squab is oh
*  It is squabs pigeon really squab it yeah you all those pigeons in New York City 100% you can shoot them and eat them
*  And they're good. I wish we were allowed
*  Just pink pink just shoot yeah, and then you just put them in a bag take them home and pluck them
*  You could hunt wild meat in the park so when people go out
*  Let's squab is that what they're really talking about like pigeoning. That's what's well. That's what squab is yeah
*  I
*  Mean that kind of makes sense yeah, that's gonna squab yeah, yeah, where the that's a weird word
*  It is squabbling squabbling about that doesn't even sound like a fight word. No, how can you fight after hearing that?
*  What about squirrel that used to be like a frontiersman hey, I shot some squirrel
*  Yeah, people still eat squirrels. Yeah, they eat squirrels all throughout the south
*  I have friends that hunt squirrels some friends of mine want to take me a squirrel raccoon and rabbit hunting mom here
*  Wow, yeah, he's a good shot by the way. He really is good really hard time killing a raccoon
*  I just think raccoons are so cool. They're the cutest they're not just a little hand little hands. Yeah, and they have little hands
*  Yeah, have you ever seen him eat like a cotton candy and water and it disappears and they get so confused
*  It's cute that's weird because they how they eat they pick up their food and then they run and eat it
*  Yeah, so they try to pick the cotton candy up and it goes away, and then they're like what happened
*  Yeah, so cute. I saw a raccoon in front of the Chelsea Hotel
*  Right next to Gotham. That's crazy. Yeah, what the fuck that was weird. This is crazy. He's searching for I lost it
*  So poor little guy. Oh what a dirty trick to play on a record
*  Look at him. He's so fucking frantic
*  Well, I found it someone when they lost their vape that down here what the fuck where's that bull shark
*  You can't escape me I can even do a water fountain
*  Comes up to the toilet remember that was always a thing that snakes are gonna be in the toilets
*  Oh, yeah, I was thinking about that the other day rats do that like if a rat really like came up and went inside of me
*  Like who's side with the EMTs be on?
*  I always wanted to know if it's true
*  Alligators in the sewer. Yeah, is that as a kid that was a big deal
*  I have pet alligators and they would release them in the sewer. Yeah, I was in video games
*  There's a movie about it, too
*  Okay, there's a movie like it was like a horror movie in the 80s about a gator that was living down in the sewers
*  And like, you know now he's like humongous and he's and he's and he's going to eat somebody. Yeah
*  That's a cool thing. That was a great urban myth. Yeah, is that it? But was it real?
*  They ever find alligators in the sewers
*  Alligators in New York City. How would they get there? They said that they will throw them away
*  Yeah, that's how we most of Florida is infested with pythons python and a bunch of those came from people's pets
*  Yeah, not all of them
*  They found out they used to think it was all pets
*  But then they found out that there was a research lab that got hit that was filled with pythons
*  They got hit with a like a hurricane or tornado or some shows like a horror movie
*  Yeah, and the pythons got loose. That's a terrible death
*  I think I found death. Oh boy. I mean honestly, yeah, you're at a python or bull shark. Oh load me first
*  Well Python you could smoke while you're dying
*  You're in the water you're already kind of like I'm fat, you know
*  My man boobs are being anything that happens in the waters
*  Ultimately more terrifying me true can't move good in the water. You can't get away
*  Video that guy jumping off the cruise ship and they videotape and he just disappears into the night. Yeah
*  His friends and he jumped off into the water and he's round took him away and in the video you just see
*  Just a head bobbing and disappearing into the dark
*  Being an idiot a drunk young kid, you know, I feel sorry for
*  The comic on the cruise ship the next day he has to do a show
*  I guess he can't swim the conditions have led to the myths of several special breeds
*  The lack of sunlight creates a blind albino gator Wow, but is it true?
*  So it started off as a myth but there have been reports of not only sightings but they have pulled a couple out but the
*  Original reports like there was hundreds in there a year and I don't think I think that's a myth
*  Wow, they've pulled a couple out of it. Yeah, I mean that's the how many they pull out
*  It started like I said, it started off as a myth to like became truth
*  Like this is a nonprofit says they pulled out five. Oh, they're just little
*  In the past two years, that's still a lot that's pretty good and they eat the rats right none from sewers
*  This is like people that have pets. Yeah, like in their bathtub. That's such a weird pet exotic. There's a dude who lived that guy
*  Somewhere I think there's a dude who lived in Harlem with the tiger the tiger. Yeah in his apartment. Yeah
*  What? Yeah crazy photo of it in the window. Yeah, like the guy like someone's like trying to climb up the fire escape
*  You see a tiger in the window. Yeah, that's the most that's amazing of all time
*  That's crazy cuz someone's got to go in and deal with that thing in an apartment. Look at
*  Yeah
*  He's so angry
*  Yeah, he's trying to fuck that guy up in an apartment. What about the neighbors? I mean like honestly, bro
*  That's gotta be tough. How bad is that apartments? Oh for sure cuz you're not gonna stop that thing from pissing on the walls
*  Right. He's gonna mark wherever he wants. So he's got a snake next to the tiger. This guy's into exotic coiled up. Yeah
*  Sorry to tell
*  That's unfair to the tiger
*  In the Bronx
*  Like when are we gonna move to Manhattan or something, you know, it's like I'm sick of being
*  We're nowhere near the part. You know the action
*  There was a really good this
*  Owl escaped from the Central Park Zoo and they tried to capture him and they couldn't and then they said he'll just be fine
*  It's living out there in Central Park. He's eating rats and pigeons and so is like helping everything and then he just flew into a building and died
*  It was sad. I felt so bad for him. It's like you finally got out
*  He was like looking for a mate and then he just like at night cuz he's owls, you know
*  They're night people so it's just like flew into somebody's building and killed himself, you know, but I thought they fly good at night
*  That's what I thought. I guess not
*  Seagull or something birds get really confused by glass. Oh, yeah, that was him Flaco
*  Oh
*  Man or Flaco that's great Flaco probably thought he was going into an opening and he hit a window sure
*  But yeah, he was he was like escaped, you know, catch-and-release belt, you know bail reform
*  You ever have that happen in your house you see your dunk and it's the sound of a knock on glass and you look out
*  Is your bird just dead? Oh geez. No, I hear it sunk on my glass. I live in Brooklyn. It's just an angry teenager
*  But that's like we drive through Nebraska and like all sudden like weird shit starts hitting your windshield, you know
*  It's like what is that? Is that a grasshopper? What is that?
*  Oh, yeah, like you know, it's just like for the amount of bug and the amount of shit that comes out of them
*  You're like, wow, that didn't make sense, you know, it's like a splatter. Imagine driving through a locust storm. Oh, that would be cool
*  Man, well, they just flood the skies. Oh god say you know locusts and grasshoppers are the same thing
*  I didn't know that what yeah grasshoppers like turn in the locusts
*  It's like a specific thing that can happen to them
*  I don't know if it's like a population thing or caterpillars into a butterfly
*  No, because it's not it doesn't always happen. Oh like find out like what turns grasshoppers into locusts
*  It's something really nutty. Wait, if you can see this leave this locust swarm. Check this out
*  Well, whatever they are she's whatever bathroom they want
*  Gee
*  Contain up to 200 million pests living creatures you fucking piece of shit
*  They're not pests. Well, that's a grasshopper if yeah, and they turn
*  But just Google what what it is. Can't you eat this? I mean
*  Edible grasshopper and cricket. Can you eat locusts? Yeah for sure. So what are we crying about?
*  Open your mouth. You need a lot of bugs
*  Various species of shorthorn grasshoppers in the family, but like they have a warming phase
*  So what causes them to swarm?
*  Locusts and grasshoppers the same in appearance but locusts can exist in two different behavioral states
*  Solitary and gregarious whereas most grasshoppers do not when the population density is low
*  Locusts behave as individuals much like grasshoppers. So it's a population thing
*  I thought it was me why the grasshoppers turn into locusts the term locusts is used for a grasshopper species that change morphology
*  morphologically and behaviorally on crowding forming swarms developed from bands of immature stages called hoppers
*  The change is described as density dependent
*  phenotypic
*  Plasticity. Yeah, so it's density dependent
*  So it's like it's something about the population that causes them to go fucking nutty
*  And so they look real different like they're color changes. Oh man, that was tough on the top there
*  That's so cool with the knees back there. They got to make a drone or something like that. I mean, honestly
*  Like pretty wild it is pretty nuts super swarm of locusts in the Illinois
*  Indiana, Ohio area this year. Oh really to you know, like they they bury themselves or they hi
*  Something years. That's a cicada. I thought yeah. Yeah, sorry. Well, please
*  Cicadas they eat those too every 17 years or 13 years the cicada return. I always love that when they come out
*  It's just like they're annoying. They're everywhere shedding their skin
*  They're really loud, but they eat those too. Wow. I know a lot of people
*  Online have videos about how to cook cicadas. Yeah, that's all things teriyaki sauce and you bake them. Apparently they're delicious
*  It's protein, right?
*  Trillions oh
*  Trillions since cicadas will emerge from Maryland to Oklahoma, Illinois to Alabama clearly trillions of adult cicadas will be present
*  But not all in the same place at the same time. Yeah. Well, that's I would hope not
*  Those fat bugs that's crazy imagine the border I
*  Think they're cool. They sound cool. So but they're out every year right and small numbers
*  Yeah, are they the ones that make the noises yeah at night
*  Are they is that the deal like they're out every year in small numbers and then every
*  Yeah, like there's different sizes of them that
*  Are you merge every year I guess this is what the world economic forum wants us to eat
*  Eat bugs and you'll be happy
*  But the thing is you need to know that you can eat them. You can't eat them. They're very edible and my friend
*  Ryan Callahan he had like a recipe for cooking them
*  They talked about take them put them on a sheet use teriyaki sauce
*  Look at teriyaki glaze cook them apparently they're delicious. I'm just a friend
*  But I don't know if I hate them and I grasshoppers in Mexico. Mmm, really crickets
*  I'm having crickets today. Do they like deep-fry them or how do they fry them somehow?
*  I don't know. I'm serum something like that. I don't know but they had a bowl of them in the room
*  I think it was crickets and I was like first of all, that's weird because like crickets are the only bug that I don't kill
*  Like if I find a cricket I catch him with my hand and bring him outside really
*  Yeah, if I find a spider you're fucked really spiders just fucked. Yeah. Well, I'll kill you. Yeah, that looks pretty good
*  Yeah, what you cook it up. They call it a chapelle enis. That's how you say it
*  I would do that dried and roasted grasshoppers a pre-hispanic Mexican delicacy
*  They're small most are shorter than the length of an adult pinky and nutty in flavor
*  The cooking process can add additional flavors such as lemon garlic and chili
*  I saw South Southeast Asia or something with a maybe it maybe it's grasshoppers and I thought it was crickets
*  Looks like that either way
*  What about like are you like an adventure food guy or no, yeah, I'll try some different stuff
*  You know the thing in the Philippines where it's like an egg but like it's it's like the fetus is already like, you know
*  It's not like a risk. Yeah, have you had that? Yeah, we serve them a fear factor
*  Oh my Filipino friends are like get the fuck out of here. Eat that easy. Like what are they scared to eat that?
*  Terrifying looking what is it? It's basically a baby bird lies. Yeah, RIO of it's a duck
*  So it is I have no idea what it is. It looks disgusting in the embryo is yeah
*  Yeah, see there's like a thing in there, oh my god, yeah, so people eat the whole thing they eat the little baby
*  They eat the yolk
*  Everything that to me is like too much. It's rough. Yeah, it's gotta be you're getting beaks in there
*  I'm such a baby with food
*  Yeah, I
*  Don't remember if I tried that I don't think that sounds like a really good tree for like a dog like hey
*  Look, there's an egg and it like a bird in there. You know, like here you go, buddy
*  I so many things on fear factor. I kind of forgot all the stuff I don't think I ate one of those snake
*  Of course, right? No, I never ate snake. Really would you eat everything that they ate to be like I ate it
*  It's fine. I would do it if I thought someone
*  Someone really real needed to know that you can do it and I'll do it for no reason
*  I'll do it for no reason. I can't even win just to show you that you could do it
*  You do this you just do it just just decide you're gonna do it and do it. It's so paternal
*  Well, it's just like coaching. Yeah, I'm trying to help these people. Yeah, that's a weird moment being on TV trying to eat a dick
*  What's the side, you know, it's like and can I get some fries with that dick fried pubes
*  Yeah, I don't know man. I think it was cool that uh, you know in New York
*  There's always like then the new restaurant the new hot thing to eat and stuff like that. I'm never into that
*  I'm not a food guy like that. You like you're into everything right? I'll try anything but I
*  Definitely in my comforts that I go back to
*  Yeah, man, it's just so hard. That's why Austin's so good. They got great food here pretty much from beginning
*  You know like the morning today
*  Tonight there's so many good food trucks. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of great options and there's a lot of you know
*  Just it's not a cool shit to do here
*  It's not overwhelmed. It's like a perfect size. Mm-hmm
*  And what's the I was gonna say
*  You know, we're doing the club right and that sixth Street has it settled down or is it still like popping the way it is
*  It's a crazy that end of it too is kind of the craziest end
*  Yeah, it is fucking wild. We're in the heart of it when you're old and you walk down the street
*  It's a whole different experience. Nobody gets it
*  Like when you're an old person with like a mortgage and walking down the street
*  They just see all that the only place I think almost as equal is San Diego
*  like that street where the American Comedy Club is because this is nothing but like
*  drunks fights
*  Just squad cars coming from every direction all the time for like two hours then it's like quiet again
*  But it's just like this amazing kind of like, you know
*  Like like almost like somebody said like, you know rung a bell. It's like be nuts
*  You know, it's like a weird urge for a couple hours purge. Yeah
*  It is like a bunch of barfield drunk women
*  God so crazy, but yeah that that just that that street man is very overwhelming
*  But that's a good place for comedy both in San Diego and here
*  It's sure be around that chaos and then come inside. You're a little like more used to chaos
*  Mmm, a little more used to like some nuttiness bring some pop
*  They're waiting in line and you do some crackheads everywhere. We have security out there to protect them. Yeah
*  Look at
*  Catchy fuck that's like a seller now in the West Village like these people line up to go see a comedy show and then there's just
*  People are costing them for money and singing songs in their face and then they come in like what the fuck just happened
*  Do you feel a noticeable change in the city? Yes with the immigrant thing. Oh
*  It depends what part of the city you're in definitely around like the Port Authority midtown
*  You'll definitely see more of that kind of you know, active and that's over how much time?
*  I'd say the last six months three months something like that. Where do you think this goes in six years?
*  No, we're good. Is it deli?
*  I really don't know but there is like
*  There there definitely is like a mood in that part of town and it's everywhere by the way
*  But that that's where you I see it the most where I'm like, whoa
*  Look at look at like the bus station here like just outside is just never been more mango and candy
*  Yeah
*  It's so much easier to get yeah, but can you imagine being like
*  19 and living, you know in in a terrible place and you're just so poor and you're like wait
*  I get to go to a place where I get away with crimes with my boys. Let's go
*  It's just like a group of lost boys. Let you right out of jail when you beat up a cop. Yeah TV. Yeah
*  We are such suckers
*  We're such suckers as a nation to let this happen it's so dumb it's the dumbest fucking thing
*  It's happening right in front of everybody's face. What do we do? What do we do?
*  And none of our elected leaders are doing anything to stop it. Yeah, but weren't they shipping them to like Martha's Vineyard and stuff
*  Well, that was Texas. That's our guy. Our guy is awesome. Yeah, he ships him
*  He's like, okay, you guys want fuck you don't want to deal with it
*  You want to let these people in yeah sanctuary cities good. We'll send them to the sanctuary city
*  So just start busting people to New York. Yeah, that's he our guy is responsible for what's happening and a lot of what's happening in New York
*  That's how they got up there. Yeah, now the government's flying them places. They're flying them to different cities
*  You can ask where you want to go
*  They give you money to give you a cell phone and the thing that's really freaking people out
*  Especially people in poor cities in this country is like where's that fucking help for us?
*  Yeah, these people housed in the Roosevelt give them three free meals a day
*  Give it a money and come masturbate wherever they want. It's amazing. That's true
*  Anywhere they want for a long time for a long time is happening a lot for a long time, especially in New York
*  They would look at you guys down here and go like, you know, what do you what do you and then they finally got to experience?
*  It's probably what we experience is probably just like one tenth of what you guys have to do being right on the border
*  So well, we're not it was border, but but I'm saying like Texas so you're down south
*  You know if you're like way down there a border town
*  Yeah, if you're in you know Juarez like right outside of Juarez if you're that's you're real close
*  I mean it's coming over. Yeah, it's affecting you. Well, it's a little while cuz I don't see many kids
*  Yeah, many families coming. Well, here's the thing though for real. It's very dangerous to bring your kids through a fucking migrant
*  Stream that's walking into Mexico. So are they a lot of work and then send money back. There's definitely that
*  but also military aged men from other countries including
*  Middle Eastern countries including China. It's like that's real too
*  And it doesn't mean that you're not compassionate for the people that are doing exactly what I would do if I was living in Ecuador
*  And I didn't have any money
*  There was no job opportunities and I knew that I could get into America and I get a job and if I busted my ass
*  I can make it and it would accept me and not only accept me but help me
*  Yeah, and give me money and you hear from your friends, bro
*  Every time you go across the border, they give you 2200 bucks
*  So there's guys on the radio in Spanish-speaking radio in San Diego telling guys how they went back and forth
*  Four times in a month. Yeah, and then they got eight grand in a month Jesus
*  Yeah, so they're living nice just by crossing back and forth and just continuing to do it
*  Well, did you read the story about the guy? I think it's from Venezuela. I had to make a move
*  He's telling people how to get over the border and then squat in houses and like how you'll just get like, you know
*  It's like they won't throw you out of their house. It's not like where we're from
*  You can just get in the house and then you can stay there
*  Yeah, yeah, so he got arrested. Yeah, she got arrested locks on her own home. Uh-huh. That to me is crazy
*  They're also saying in New York if you're in a house for 30 days you legally become a tenant
*  Yeah, that's right. You get mail sent to the place in your name. It's yours. That is
*  That is do I love this story?
*  I think it happened like Seattle or Portland or something
*  This guy was at every you know March and rally and he was like big antifa and communism and he met someone there and the
*  Guy was like hey, can I crash with you? And the guy was like, yeah, sure
*  So he brought him and his girlfriend and stayed on the couch and after two weeks the guy wouldn't let
*  The homeowner into his own house and he had to call the police which is like against their religion
*  Holy shit, is that the best? Oh my god, that's hilarious
*  That's amazing. I was talking to friends of mine
*  There's like it's like over a thousand squatter situations in Atlanta and they're like, well, it's only thousand the population is this big
*  It doesn't really matter. I'm like dude
*  Ten people doing it is alarming
*  Raising yeah, that means they know how to do it. They know the loophole
*  Yeah, you need to tighten that loophole up you fuck. People are so smart. They know how to jock the system
*  100% especially criminals and yeah fraudsters, which is a type of person who's got I mean you imagine they're filming him. This is my house
*  Yeah
*  Fuck dude is where I live now and they know that you have to pay them to get out and that's what a lot
*  Homeowners do but the problem is then another person is just gonna jump in when the eviction process is so long and you have to
*  Hire a lawyer you have to go to court
*  Good luck trying to sell the place because you're not there in the house
*  But they always hold up like a dirty piece of paper I have a lease and it's like like a happy face
*  This guy was explaining how he did it in this YouTube video he's saying that he you get a fake lease
*  So you dropped out draft up a fake lease you use that lease to get the power and things turn in your name
*  You pay the bill like there's a bunch of different steps that you can do
*  That just seems to indicate that you are the legal right and then they have to take you to court and it could be months
*  In months years even get a trial. Yeah, where do they stay the homeowners?
*  They're fucked in a migrant hotel the creek the it's so crazy that in the name of protecting tenants, which is important
*  You know a shitty landlord you're detectants, but in the name of protecting tenants
*  You're you're basically allowing people steal people's houses for sure and not just one if Atlanta has a thousand
*  What is the number of people they're squatting currently Jamie in the United States?
*  Try Google
*  Why don't you ask chat GPT
*  It's not only that they're squatting here. Let's see what that bitch says you see how they abuse the house too
*  Like they'll like smear shit on the walls. They'll do all kinds of things like sure did so I'm like you really own this his mansion
*  America business in us
*  Well, you have a day Dykstra did it and it was his mansion
*  Yeah, and they were like evicting him and he's like I'm gonna take a shit on the floor
*  Yeah, yeah, and then didn't Gretzky by the house. He bought it from Gretzky
*  Oh, he's got his house. Yeah, and then he shit all over it when they were taking away. Fuck you not cool
*  That's a different story though. He wasn't a squatter. Yeah, he just went broke. Yeah, that's like when you go to a friend's house
*  You have a party and like that last guy who has nowhere to go. He's like, hey man, you know, we can
*  This is a different level your honor
*  The guys he can't get out of your parties are the worst. Yeah, that's the main reason why people don't have parties
*  I don't know the one guy who won't leave. Yeah, I gotta get up early man. You know, that's all right
*  I can barely get people to leave my podcast studio
*  Especially get a little drunk and they just don't get the hints. Yeah, you're like you are drunk. You must leave lights out. What?
*  Are you doing?
*  Are you fucking? Yeah, you fucking tripping bro. Yeah, I was that guy
*  Yeah, I would just curl up on their welcome mat like a cat
*  That's what happened that guy had that kid the Kansas City Chief Party and then the guys go outside they're like dude
*  Can we just hang a little bit longer? You know, maybe a warm-up
*  He's like now you got to go and then they all like for popsicles outside really
*  Yeah, like wow how many of them died like it was like four of them. I think Jesus
*  Yeah, they found the bodies like right outside, you know, but it was really is such a bad hang that you
*  Some controversy to that story like the they don't know. Yeah. Yeah the the story seems fishy
*  There's something with it might have been drugs. It might have just been like, you know, they died somewhere else and he put him out there
*  You know, I think there was some controversy with the guy who called it in like they didn't he didn't do it quick enough
*  I forget what it was. They were high started getting suspicious. They were very high though
*  They were very what you know, they were drunk and they were just doing powder a bit something like that. Maybe oxys
*  Yeah, that's why they just fell asleep outside. That's okay. What's chat GBT say as my last update in January 2022
*  I don't have access to most recent statistics on the number of people squatting in houses in the US
*  Squatting is often a complex and underappointed issue. That's a government in accurate data can be challenging due to its illegal and
*  Authorized nature you may need to consult recent studies reports or data from relevant organizations
*  Agencies for the month. Well, this is chat GBD for chat GBD five. It would be like I know how to get them out
*  Here's your plan
*  I don't know the full thing in Atlanta about the first article I pulled up said 1,200 homes. Yeah
*  Investors I don't know like how many of them are people buying houses and never living in them and there's vacant houses everywhere
*  You know what like Airbnb's type things
*  There's a bunch of Airbnb's you know that kind of situations going on right now or a bunch of so they might move in the Airbnb
*  And they just stay it could be I know that they're definitely people doing that because this lady videotaped this woman who wouldn't leave her place
*  She's like I'm not going nowhere and you have to keep the lights bitch
*  This bitch is in my fucking house and she ever can't even my fucking keep the shit out of them
*  And then just know you'll be out the next day. It's already everyone's aware that this is an issue already by then
*  So now they've got their eye on you and you can't really just say this person is in my kitchen
*  They attacked me you know you'd have to fight to the death
*  You have to keep the lights and the heat all that on as the homeowner because if you shut it off
*  That's like a big red flag like you're not allowed to do that. They might not even be allowed to be in the home
*  Hmm. I think a lot of this came in New York City from
*  the till program and well in the 70s with all the
*  Houses and buildings just being completely abandoned and turned to shit. Yeah a lot of people were squatting
*  That's right because they were like homeless so they were like all right well
*  We have to figure this out so that we don't have all these people on the street
*  You know Tom and then they didn't change it. Yeah in the 80s. I remember they they
*  Back I guess that was like a Giuliani thing actually where they were like we got these squatters in these buildings
*  And we want them out you know like in order to repurpose the building you had to get all these people that had already set
*  Up power and all kinds of stuff in the buildings so the cops would go in and then you would just see like a rush
*  Of like skinhead looking dudes come flying out through the park, and they would like
*  Rockers it was crazy yeah, and it was just like they were squatters
*  They were like you know street kids that were living in these buildings. Yeah
*  But that's when some of the best music came out of New York City
*  They were all music really a lot of together. Yeah, probably right. Yeah, totally agnostic front and you know
*  Bad brains and everything they were all squatting
*  chroma makes you legit mm-hmm
*  Yeah, well as a homeowner. That's one of my biggest fears squatting. I'm on the road I come back
*  Hello David if it's New York some lady just they think this lady got murdered because she went into a house that was
*  Her house to clean it up, and there were squatters lived in there
*  And then they fucking killed her and put her in a bag. Yep, Jesus
*  The cutting them up, that's the thing and then there's you know then the problem is like good luck catching them
*  You know they're just gonna. There's no paperwork on these people
*  They're just wandering around the street the city squatters suspected of killing woman in New York City apartment stuffing her body into duffel bag
*  Yeah
*  Victims found squatter in mother's vacant apartment
*  What a horrible way to go. Vittels was killed after she traveled to New York City from Spain
*  To get the apartment ready to be occupied by a family friend
*  It been vacant for months after the death of her mother police sources say Vittels didn't know when she went to the apartment the two
*  Squatters had been living there when she arrived
*  She could be seen on surveillance video coming and going from the apartment police believe the two squatters
*  Returned to the apartment after Vittels arrived surprised and killed her by beating her to death
*  How do these squatters fuck are they on Zillow like what the fuck are they doing?
*  Find these old places from someone someone figures out that there's an apartment. That's empty cheese
*  Jesus oh my god
*  Wow what a horrible death. Two suspects went to use car dealers after the crash looking to buy a car
*  They remain at large Jesus, so they beat her to death and they're at large
*  Video stealing her Lexus from the street
*  Fleeing the car police said sources said was later involved in an accident in Pennsylvania
*  Well, they'll get them when they have to charge when they charge the Lexus
*  They don't make electric cars, oh, sorry Lexus is a Japanese Toyota believes in hybrids oh
*  Toyota has a different strategy
*  For EVs can you be can you imagine being a vicious murderer and getting away in a Prius?
*  That's the car you want to take people wouldn't unless you have too many stickers on the back
*  Just a bunch of coexist
*  You're probably really aggressive about your insistence and everyone coexist Wow did you guys see that video that?
*  Edward Snowden posted that shows
*  Israel bombing these kids no just walking in Gaza where?
*  It's horrible dude
*  Because they're clearly not armed snow didn't just walking these snowed in yeah
*  Edward Snowden put it on his Twitter, and it's these these young men are just walking down the street and they
*  Yeah, he's still in Russia right yeah, yes to hide in Russia
*  So these guys are just walking down the street
*  And this they don't clearly not armed
*  This is like after the bombings and everything these people are probably going back to see if their house is there who knows?
*  What the fuck they're doing right what if they thought they were squatters you they whoa?
*  Look how quick it happens. Oh
*  So that guy in the front is running away. Yeah, oh shit. I gotta get the fuck out of here
*  And so they zoom in on him
*  Stop running. Oh, they got him too. Oh, yeah
*  That's come bro the way they do it. I mean there's nothing left to you
*  They're literally targeting you with a missile yes, you just disappear look at that is it a missile or is it a drone?
*  Well, it's a missile coming from a drone
*  Probably or I mean it might be coming from somewhere else. I don't know where you know I believe it's a drone though
*  Isn't that what the the contention is sure wow yeah?
*  So they have drones that can do this which is so insane dude
*  And they're not showing you the bodies because it's just a bloody we know it's so creepy
*  Have you seen those drone videos in Ukraine and Russia?
*  And it's it's really good quality
*  And then they dropped a little bomb on the guys and then they put like Russian techno music over it
*  Like it's
*  So creepy it's so creepy you just see guys hanging out and then they just explode
*  Yeah, well that's what they say now is that they can see everything at all times
*  So it's really hard to like use like tactics
*  We're like we'll sneak up on them on the you know and then we'll go this way
*  They can't do that anymore. It's like those those kind of tactics are old now. What do you do everywhere?
*  Satellites are everywhere satellite ones are everywhere
*  They have silent drones if you see a drone coming you just like why except death these guys think this tarp will help them
*  You know all the leg
*  What's that oh
*  So you're to been shot oh here it is oh
*  My god, dude, it's pretty amazing how they figured that out
*  Go
*  Just drop a bomb from a fucking drone and cook everybody
*  You should be able to hear it right if it's a if it's a civilian drone because they make that loud like that
*  Buzz and then it's pretty it's like you shoot it down a hundred feet. Yeah, they have issues
*  Then they also have that like EMT blast on it where they can basically take control of the or stop the signal and it'll just land
*  Like a perk and call of duty. It's insane
*  Yeah, but I'm sure they probably have ones that avoid that stuff. Mm-hmm
*  I think they just keep getting these things better. How how silent are the drones now? Oh
*  Did you hear about the drones that were hovering over the base that they think are from China and they had been hovering over there for weeks
*  I didn't read that one. But yeah, I heard it's they've updated the balloons. It's a
*  What you'll call it. What base was that again? Yeah, I'll find it. I've got this story
*  Somebody sent it to me. I saved it but it's it's it's a scary story because it says for weeks
*  Man, I you know, I hate to jinx it but it's just like, you know
*  These things you can just buy and that the fact that you know
*  Luckily, no people in this country have used it like like the way they're using it. We're really lucky
*  I mean honestly think about all the situations are we lucky or is it just a matter of time?
*  Well, evidently whatever they're doing is like, you know, just think of like New Year's Eve all those different like gatherings
*  You know a game, you know, it could be even like a high school stop giving the enemy I
*  I'm trying to connect to our you know, what's your first responder fan base
*  Your contractors and whatnot, but I'm sure that's a big keeps them up at night thinking about that stuff, you know
*  Dude that fucking video is horrible. All those videos are the video those guys in Gaza's horrible and go back to sharks
*  How about the well I was gonna say though the Ukrainians have those those drones now that take out the ships
*  You know the sea babies they call them look at this is just
*  Mysterious drone swarmed Langley Air Force Base for weeks for weeks
*  The unidentified drones were such an issue that assets were called in from around the government including NASA WD
*  WB 57 high-altitude jet
*  Wow, so what does it say these things look like? Yeah a
*  dragon
*  That would be a dope way to show really flex
*  Like a dragon does it say what the description of these things were
*  That's the f-35 that's what I think a lot of this alien shit is ah
*  Yeah, that's what they're saying now to a lot of it. I think it's drone technology that we don't admit to we don't know
*  Yeah
*  To protect protect operational security. We did not discuss impacts to operations
*  The statement said we don't discuss our specific force protection measures
*  But retained the right to protect and the installation Langley continues to monitor our
*  Aerospace and work with local law enforcement and other federal agencies to ensure the safety of base personnel facilities
*  Assets does it say you hear that a uas uncrewed aerial system a number of uas is
*  Fluctuated and they ranged in size and configuration none of the incursions appear to be exhibit hostile intent
*  But anything flying in our restricted airspace can pose a threat to flight safety
*  interesting
*  Uncrewed aerial system it could also test the reaction time. You know like a drone. Yeah, it must be it must be a drone because
*  That means they're not saying it's a uap
*  What is the most sophisticated drone currently available but Google most sophisticated nuclear or most sophisticated
*  Military drone that we know of yeah, just Google that term most sophisticated military drone
*  picture of Obama
*  the
*  They have the ones that are like little fighters now
*  They're like able to do turns that no human could take today little ones that buzz and have like machine guns on them
*  Look at this one. Well that one's yeah, that's a spy
*  That's cool that can fly for days
*  Okay, so here we got
*  Dissolved neuron that is cool. Okay these fucking things with the propeller in the back Wow
*  They must be loud as shit though, no
*  They have a power plant in them
*  Well, I guess I mean it's a it's an engine I guess this means yeah Rolls Royce engine. Yeah, shout out to rolls
*  turbocharged
*  That'd be loud right a turbocharged piston engine. Yeah, that'd be loud 450 horsepower
*  That's pretty fast for that little thing
*  It is cool
*  Yeah, you see the ones with the Ukraine with the boats whether like taking out the Russian Navy
*  That is pretty cool. How they did that. Well, look at that thing. That's huge. Holy shit. I know they're that big
*  Look at that
*  Wow
*  That's a crazy flying room. I can murder you how nutty is that?
*  That's one of those things where it just like flies over is like every phone call like immediately saps it up
*  But which one of these have missiles?
*  So some of these must be just spies that one does the hellfires
*  I think yeah, then you have to make it so it can have missiles
*  I think they can probably that's almost any of them. Look at the little one though guys has in his hand
*  Can I play too
*  I'm just annoying
*  I'm just annoying
*  Yeah, I guess they wouldn't make one that couldn't shoot a missile the little one just collects gossip
*  Guess he's
*  Look at that. The missiles just sit go back to that picture you just heard
*  The one you just showed with the missiles in the bottom of it, yeah, that's the classic that's pretty wild
*  Awesome, so it's got two missiles and one of those two things beside the missiles
*  Missile those are two different kinds. Wow
*  These can probably go really far. They might be guns. I think it defensive
*  Maybe right to shut like flares and share the ground as they do that when someone's shooting a missile at them
*  They'll shoot off a flare to detract the heat seeking missile and then these are just the ones we know about because there's gotta be some shit
*  Oh, yeah for sure
*  Again, that's what I think a lot of that stuff is that people are reporting these you think yeah, that's what I think
*  I think a lot of these things that people are seeing that they think are UFO is just some super sophisticated propulsion system
*  Some of them are keeping really creepy though
*  Like the way they they hover around or fly around like the one they showed like one or two from in the Middle East
*  Just like it did look like it was either a UFO or a monster or some kind of like this one that looks like
*  Like a jellyfish, but it's flying around. It's got like stuff. Hey, yeah, like what is that?
*  You know, that one's very weird because that one goes in the ocean too that one
*  It goes into the ocean that comes back. I told you last time we looked I looked something like this
*  This thing came out and that is so cool
*  It says it's a drone and it goes underwater and it goes underwater
*  But it never I couldn't find anywhere that this thing was being sold
*  It was I had like a Kickstarter type program on me ten years ago
*  But here's the problem with this even like pretending that that's real
*  Where what's the propulsion system? That's it may have not ever been real people. No, I don't think it's real
*  I think it's a basketball
*  I'm really do look at how the bottom or it's great. Yeah, I think that's like a volleyball or a basketball or something
*  I think that's totally fake
*  I think it's because there's no method of propulsion like you can't just have a basketball that flies liquid gravity
*  And shut the fear shape no outside propellers are moving parts, but then it doesn't say how
*  Golf ball. I don't know. There's no video exactly. They use a golf ball as one of them
*  Shut the fuck up that thing's fake as fuck one
*  You have to have an out you have to have an exhaust
*  Every fucking propulsion system that we know of right now has to have either a fan like you got to have a propeller
*  Or you have to have an engine that shoots stuff out the back and makes you go for it
*  That's it. So these things that people keep seeing that don't operate like that
*  That's what makes me think the government has something that doesn't need a traditional combustion engine for a propulsion system
*  I'm Google
*  Yeah, I wouldn't tell them I wouldn't tell the whole world what we could do the fuck out here
*  Yeah, make it better every year to the point where it's basically a UFO
*  And if you just think about the unlimited amount of money that they've had and they've been designing
*  Military vehicles and jet engines and fucking they've been doing that for decades
*  Yeah
*  All that time making one thing that no one knows about better and better and better and better
*  flying around area 51
*  Mmm, I bet there's a lot of those that people are seeing if they're like, oh my god, they were real
*  Aliens are real but it's just us testing but and also I think aliens are real I think I do too
*  Yeah in what way I'm hoping they are I really am hoping they are real. I really do
*  No, I didn't say I didn't ever say that guy didn't believe it
*  I think the things he was just talking about I'm like some of them are secret projects. Some of them are aliens
*  That's what I'm hoping. Yeah, there is definitely another presence here like in this world or whatever it is
*  You know, yeah and that there there has to be something to explain a lot of these sightings which are not explainable
*  So it's real likely that both things are true
*  because it just doesn't make any sense with the universe as big as it is that there's no one else out there and
*  If they do develop the ability to go way past where we are
*  Yeah, they should be able to be invisible. That should be easy. They should be able to come here anytime they want that should be easy
*  I mean if you look at a species like ours like that's this intelligent as the human species if we got
*  1 million years more advanced 1 million years more than who the fuck knows what we can do
*  We're gonna be weird in five years from now
*  Five years from now with AI things are gonna be off the chart weird
*  So imagine that just keeps going for a million years, which is really possible
*  I mean crocodiles have been around for fucking 65 million years or whatever. Yeah, it's totally possible
*  Well, do you remember that cab driver in Vegas that told us?
*  This guy's very UFO
*  Lot of UFO stories this guy. He told it. What was the portal one of the casinos?
*  Oh, yeah
*  There's a secret railway under like the MGM Grand and that that's where aliens are coming from area 51
*  It's like I've never even heard of this theory and it was like no, it's true. Yeah, and it's a layer and yeah
*  He had a lot of like there's no way
*  250 humans at one time would want to go to a casino. Yeah, that was a joke at the end
*  I don't know if he was driving us or driving away from his ex-wife, but we were driving for a long time
*  If I was gonna be an alien I want to abduct some people though, I think Vegas would be a good spot
*  No one would miss them. Yeah, not only that they'd be so confused. Like I don't know what I think someone spiked my drink
*  an alien spaceship
*  And in Vegas everything goes like there's always like a new thing to do so that would definitely become like an elect the sphere
*  You know, yeah
*  Yeah, imagine if there was a like an abduction program
*  Like you could actually get abducted and instead of like abducting us and just ruining people's lives
*  What if we made a deal with the UFOs? Hey, listen, you guys got it all wrong. We're willing to get it
*  Yeah, you can take us on board and do test. Yeah, but we don't care
*  We're totally willing to be your guinea pig. Oh influencers would try to do that
*  100% live streaming. Well, yeah your anal probe
*  Yeah
*  It's worth it
*  Yeah, if they really wanted to come and abduct us we would be more than willing to let them
*  You don't really have to force what if the aliens are is
*  Technology in terms of how advanced it's gotten in such a short period of time and then the people using it are just basically drones
*  That are using this exposed technology. Well, it's possible that that's the future of life
*  The future of life is we integrate with technology and that's the only way because like the biological
*  Evolutionary process is really slow. But the technological evolutionary process is really fast like crazy fast
*  Like you can have a whole new thing in a year. Whereas I like a whole new species like God
*  How does it even happen? You know, how does it even happen? And then they're like when species are hybrids
*  They're not viable. So like some of them aren't some of them aren't
*  How long does it take to make a human out of a monkey? How long does it take to make a monkey out of an amoeba?
*  It's too long. They don't have that time
*  If you can integrate with technology then you have an insane ability to adapt
*  And then probably you just stop being a person
*  Probably will realize that that's already out there people stop being people. Well, you can't say a little bit
*  Yeah, you know the whole send people to Mars like I was looking at like how long it takes to get anywhere like it takes
*  About six days three days to get to the moon, which is doable
*  That's why the moon is the way to go Mars is like nine months to a year
*  But then the other planets let's say we like in a whatever at our current like ability to like travel like Jupiter
*  25 years and there's really nothing there except for that. I oh moon whatever that is
*  I'm hoping I'm not seeing it wrong
*  Like the fact that like we're not built for outer space and yet we keep craving this whole thing when you're right
*  It should be some kind of techno hybrid of a human something that would be able to do that, you know
*  Yeah, and it'll probably if you become a machine
*  Yeah of a person you don't have to worry about being crushed by gravity because you'll have a carbon fiber hull
*  Mm-hmm, and all your orgasms will happen from
*  And then you'll be all in radiation all that stuff that this because space is a killer
*  You know, it's like it's not built for that thing and you're taking 25 years to get to Jupiter
*  Well, the technology exists to make you not be bored. Like what are you gonna do for 25 years?
*  They should put you in a video games the entire flight. It's gonna be amazing
*  I've been preparing for years months of video games that go by on your trip to Mars
*  Have a local area network set up and you and the other astronauts just fucking geeking out all day
*  Just drinking Mountain Dew
*  Smiling yeah, if you knew that you didn't have any responsibilities other than playing video games
*  You know quick six months could go by that sounds like hell though. You know, why not for me all the games?
*  All the games. I mean don't you want to get up and move around?
*  Maybe not is there if you just put that fucking Mark Zuckerberg headset on you can pretend you're moving around
*  Is there a dick sucking robot that I could oh, definitely. Okay, I'm in that's
*  That's probably already here probably there you have that in China they're probably testing it out right now
*  The what is it called again?
*  fanbot or something which
*  Sex doll, but it's whatever you have to I don't know those are coming. Yeah
*  Those are car. Yeah, have you seen that robot that like cooks and like sets up your kitchen for you?
*  The robot like puts plates away and shit there. I think it's called a wife
*  I
*  Use a son of a bitch
*  Yeah, there's a new AI powered chat GPT robot that does simple tasks around the kitchen and but it communicates
*  We like a person even says um, it's very weird. Oh like it's thinking goes um
*  So the reason why I did that is I'm putting these plates away in this rack
*  And I'm you know, you'll dump garbage on the on the table and say please clean that up
*  Surely they just pick look at this why why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash
*  On it so I gave you the apple
*  Because it's the only edible item I could provide you with from the table. Oh, that is so weird. Oh
*  Look at that
*  What yeah great it stands to based on the scene right now
*  Where do you think the dishes in front of you go next?
*  So it's analyzing the image
*  It's slow right now table like that plate and cup are likely to go into the drying rack next
*  Why does it sound like it's narrating this American life? It's got a raspy voice. Yeah
*  It is weird
*  That really looks like a puppet. It doesn't look like a robot. No, man. It does a lot of other things
*  That's amazing. Look at that is truly amazing addition to the drying rack
*  Does it apologize if it makes a mistake if it breaks your dick? Yeah, rips it right off. I'm sorry
*  I applied too much force my bad. Well that eventually have like a skin covering or will look like that
*  100% pretty well the Apple found its new owner. Oh
*  The tableware is right where it belongs. I call bullshit
*  You don't see that guy's face every time he talks that guy is a ventriloquist
*  Oh
*  Hey buddy, how about you get behind the table with him? Yeah, let's drink your glass of water fucking fraud show it dynamic walking
*  The dynamic walking one is wild
*  So this thing by the way, it doesn't have to have that job that'll maze over its chest
*  But it does if it doesn't want you to kill it. That's a minute. It looks bulletproof. You have to shoot it in the lens
*  But look at it walk around and move amazing
*  That's amazing and this is think about like a model t and then think about a Tesla, okay a model t
*  Sexy that's crazy in a wild but think about a model t right model t's like big stupid wooden wheels
*  This is really not two years. Look at that. Yeah, this is that's amazing
*  You know that it could do this new American look how agile it is. This is Boston Dynamics
*  And so they can do all kinds of things they can they can fucking saw wood they can do construction
*  They can hop up on boxes. Look at this
*  This is before AI right? So well they had AI but they didn't have AI
*  Available to everybody because now in the in the future you'd look at something like this and go like this is probably not really happening
*  This is just a eyes. This is real. I've seen this is real
*  Jumps they programmed it to hop around gay that is amazing and they program to toss the stuff up to him
*  This is so much better than a lazy dock worker
*  Some guy doesn't like his job and needs a cigarette break this look at that ready to go and if they figure out how to make
*  Yo, it does
*  It's a gymnast and if they figure out a way to make very small
*  Nuclear powered engines which I think they're already doing I think there's isn't there
*  Is it China that has a small nuclear powered power plant? Yes, so they'll be able to make a nuclear powered power plant
*  That's the size of a fucking cell phone and stuff it in that thing. It'll be able to go for 90 years
*  Holy shit like a battery like a nuclear but they already have that with where they use it to power like they used to do for
*  Spacecraft, but you're right. Then it would be endless nuclear battery
*  Produces power for 50 years without needing to charge. That's crazy
*  Says its battery could power mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever
*  Forever, would you really want a nuclear powered phone? That's the one thing fuck. Yeah, you would
*  To wear like an external case
*  Some sort of a shield from the I'm sure the government wouldn't allow these companies to sell it if it was dangerous
*  So just no, yeah, let's just let it get out there and let's just see what happens fall where they may true
*  Don't be a pussy. Okay, don't you want a robot? I like the robot thing though want a robot?
*  We're gonna get robot fuck dolls for
*  Shizzy people are so anti robot already. They had the what was that in San Francisco the self self-driving taxi
*  They lit it on fire that it was like basically like, you know, like the Amish people like that
*  They attacked it they destroyed it but they do that to regular
*  This is again, this is a sampling bias
*  You got homeless crazy fentanyl zombies that are just trying to smash everything people leave their fucking windows rolled down the keys
*  Yeah, like in Canada, they're telling to leave their keys outside their
*  Forey they tell them to leave your keys like near the door
*  Yeah, the people don't have to like roam through your house trying to steal your car. Yes, really?
*  Evasion yes, they said listen to make it easier. Just leave the keys outside like what?
*  How about the new low stop people from stealing my fucking car? What am I paying in taxes for you fuckheads?
*  It's like clean needle centers or like if you're gonna do the drugs, you know
*  No, no, please the clean needle centers are a lot more reasonable. I like that kind of versus plans to allow police robots to kill suspects
*  Yeah
*  but this is how bad San Francisco's got that this was a
*  Suggestion yep, and they actually have a robot. They're like not yet. Not yet. Let's wait till things go really sideways
*  Are they working on like technology for us to read thoughts? Oh, yeah. What about like learning what our cats are thinking?
*  I was low down on the
*  Your cats are thinking I wish you were small so I could eat you know, uh, yeah, not my cat
*  They my cats gone. I love you when you die the you almost immediately good. I want to be one with my cat
*  Let's take a piss break cuz I got a piss too. Yeah, let's pause this bitch right here
*  What the fuck are you doing Dave? You're living in?
*  1995 yeah, yeah, you know, he sends me emails with no body and everything's in the subject
*  How long is the subject
*  To return so it's all up there. Yeah
*  It's the best listen to the great sound when I'm doing it like Morse code
*  How long does this take for you to accomplish this I'm done
*  So you don't have an iPhone at all and I have one too, but not even me off the grid. Yeah, this is my
*  When shit happens right here. I'm ready to go
*  So what do you use that one for like who do you text on that?
*  No, this one's like just like for all my texts and the other ones for emails. Wait a minute
*  This is not online text on that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So when I text you you text me on that
*  Feel it
*  Spaces in between words
*  I'm sending you a text right now. I want to see what happens. That is so insane
*  This is good, oh my god, yeah comes up green
*  Just wait let wait for the sound Dave you texting are you calling I'm texting you tell me about your upcoming weekend at the mothership
*  It might take a while
*  No, it doesn't have voice to text either does it no he doesn't if it did I wouldn't do that anyhow
*  Really? I'm like super paranoid with the web and everything. So this is like this is like you have an iPhone
*  I do but you know, that's what's we'll call it bait and switch
*  Okay, let's see if I get it
*  Did you get it yet? I did no
*  Okay, I didn't get to make the sound your name isn't they always make sounds every time you
*  Text a button it makes a sound. Yeah, that doesn't drive. It really annoys people too. Yeah
*  So it takes you in four presses to get an s still you're doing that thing. Yeah
*  You got to really want it
*  That is so I can't even find your thing yet
*  It'll take me days remember when people started using you like the letter you yeah of while you because of that
*  Yeah, I'm saver just a little time saver. Mm-hmm
*  It doesn't even have emojis on it like any emoji is like he still uses emoticons like a colon and a parentheses
*  I use it sometimes too for a smiley face. Well, are you guys done with this tech beat down?
*  Like I'm a tech hoarder come out of the house buddy, come on we love you how long have you been flip phone I
*  Never I have one in my house, which I'm sure is worth a lot of money because it has the antenna on it
*  That's like my retirement plan I'm gonna sell that to a museum or some collector
*  It's got that little like and I'm like man. I can't believe like we actually used to think this did something like yeah
*  I can't really hear you. Hold on. Yeah
*  Now it's up. I can hear you too clear. Let me put it down just a little bit
*  I wonder I think I probably did a little something. Yeah, but you had one of these
*  Yeah, actually that reminds me of a story about you
*  Bill
*  Blumenreif, you know what he said to me he goes, you know back in the day one of the comics who always worked was Joe
*  And you know why I go why he goes he had a cell phone before anybody else
*  So whenever there was a fallout, I would call Joe Joe was there Joe wanted it and I was like, wow
*  so it was like a
*  Like a cool story about like just as we went from like, you know
*  Calling someone on a landline to like a cell phone and that you were ahead of the game
*  This is like 89 easy my car. Yeah. Yeah
*  And that's how it was for the young comics, you know having a car was a good thing
*  You know I'm saying my god you needed a car to get around if you didn't have a car
*  You you're not getting the gigs. Yeah, you had to have someone drive you to gigs
*  Yeah, that didn't happen because like I could get a call from Blumenreif like hey someone just got sick. That was it
*  Yeah, I was saying in two hours. There's a gig in New Hampshire. Can you make it? Like I'm on my way. That's awesome
*  Yeah, cuz you wanted it. Yeah, and he would tell me over the phone. Okay, you're gonna take the 405
*  So I had these pieces of paper that were like, you know
*  dicks chuckle fuck and
*  Whether the place was because dick darty had a bunch of them dick darty like the comedy hut and all these different comedies the comedy vault
*  That's awesome that Boston scene must have been like cuz you know talk about in New York like, you know starting out
*  I always felt like there was definitely more
*  Rooms like more open mics and stuff like that
*  But Boston like you kind of like there were there were paying gigs if you could do them, you know
*  Headline and there was so many local great headliners that like you really like swimming with sharks, basically
*  I mean it was like so many guys that could just like basically, you know
*  Knock blow you off the stage at any minute, you know, and they would do it to people on purpose. They did it to me
*  I know that with Nick they do it
*  They would just come like the hooky lau or something like that
*  Like you don't mind if I do a little time and there was like 40 minutes of solid, you know, every
*  Every Boston thing they could throw at me and then I'm up there with my like, you know, you know little people jokes
*  To be polite
*  Go home, you know screaming at you they did it on purpose to people for sure
*  Wow, and we deserved it too, by the way
*  Well, they had an attitude about the rest of the world when it came to comedy that felt like the best comics were in Boston
*  But they all stayed in Boston and whenever guys would come out from out of town that were like headliners like national headliners
*  Roast that guy. Oh for sure. They would throw him after Don Gavin and Steve Sweeney and Kevin Knox and fuck
*  It was it was such a wake-up, but even the crowds themselves like very, you know
*  Very like, you know, you better prove it. Oh, yeah be up there if you're the closer you better be the best guy here
*  And also there was so many
*  Fucking headliners that they were just so used to a very high level of headliner. Yeah, these guys were killers
*  You just pull out a comb to do your fucking mustache. Yes. I was hoping you were making eye contact with Dave
*  How often do you comb your mustache a fair amount
*  Whenever I feel the need
*  Do you have a specific mustache comb or just use any old?
*  I just got one from Walgreens or whatever. I've seen them little tiny ones
*  I don't like them that the teeth are too sharp and it hurts my little face
*  You got to sometimes shickets in there, you know trimmed it up today
*  Tony loose hairs
*  Now I'm afraid my hair will fall out so I can't do it
*  Looking at the demise I know yeah
*  I started going bald when I was like 18 really crazy. Yeah, what was that like lonely?
*  This is a kid in my high school that was going bald at 15 and everybody called him Baldy. Oh
*  God, I was his nickname Baldy. That's horrific kids were brutal. They were they were fucking brutal in the 80s
*  They were brutal in the 90s and 2000 brutal right now
*  Yeah, they're beyond brutal. I think now this is just heartless what they're doing, you know, yeah, that's like I
*  Don't know but we didn't have that web to like, you know, everything you does
*  Yeah, and then also I get the clicks
*  Getting their ass kicked someone's feeling it. Thank God that didn't exist
*  Imagine how many dick pics you'd have out there in the world
*  Be in trouble. Yeah, this kids today. Yeah
*  These kids today teachers and students
*  Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, that's wild teachers always fuck students. It was always like teachers fucking students. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, but we didn't find out about it till later
*  Like did you hear someone so used to fuck mr. Bla bla. There's always the like very advanced senior. It was yeah banging a Spanish teacher
*  Rolling is ours. It's funny like that's like professors and universities that was kind of understood
*  That was part of the gig. That was yeah
*  Why I used to be a teacher and they're like never ever be in a room with the door shut
*  You leave the door open all the time never alone with anyone. I was like, yeah, this is fucking nuts
*  Yeah, and I see some of the shit with what teachers share on the internet with them and like students
*  I'm like, this is such a violation of boundaries. It's crazy
*  What do you you know, the homeschooling seems way better now like I was like teachers fuck their kids
*  Seems like a better option for everything
*  Oh shit, you know, so it's like hey homeschool. You must be weird now. It's like I guess you're just being safe
*  You know, yeah, you don't want you kidding doctrinator either. Mm-hmm. What do you think of college now? Do you think it's a waste of time?
*  Yes, well
*  Clearly depends on what you want to do if you want to be a computer coder good fucking luck
*  Mm-hmm AI is gonna take over all that. Yeah, there's there's so many jobs are gonna vanish
*  That's true five years
*  But it's also like it's such a rude
*  Cruel thing to do to an 18 year old kid that has no fucking idea what they want to do for their lives
*  Yes, and you force them into debt decide now and you force them into a debt. That's
*  Insanely difficult to get out of
*  Hmm. It's way harder than just getting going bankrupt. It's it's hard to get out of that debt
*  Why I got in trouble when I was teaching because I told all my students I'm like
*  Take the test to go to school but pick up a trade go to trade school and start making money
*  It's like the smart thing to do well if that's what you want to do
*  But you know, it depends on what you're trying to do with your life
*  I think somebody wants to be a journalist you should probably go to school
*  Yeah, but if you don't know what you want to do what what you do, you know
*  I guess that's what it is go out and get a job and know you can always go to college later, you know
*  Yeah, but you won't yeah, you're working peer pressure. Yeah, also your family's pressure
*  Oh, yeah
*  When you're young like you have that window where you can kind of like take wild chances from like 18 to like 24 25
*  Once you're like 25 everybody's like hey get your fucking together
*  You know me even earlier than that if you're in the Northeast
*  But if you are, you know already in a job and you work in eight hours a day, you're fucking tired
*  Yeah, the odds that you're gonna quit that and stop making money. Yeah go to school. Those aren't so high
*  I think it's harder on you know, not to be the old guy, but like
*  This generation's taught that they're exceptional and that everything they do is like important
*  Whereas I think when I was growing up it was like no nothing you do is really that important and that you're also gonna have to
*  Like kind of work your way up in something. I think a lot of them see their peers like, you know, they went to college
*  They dropped out they started a company or you know, they're an influencer with a million followers
*  So they see success differently than we do and like for me it was like yeah
*  You got to like kind of work your way up or like, you know, it's really about how much you want it
*  You know that kind of thing whereas now I think I feel like there's there really is no game plan
*  It's really you know, it's kind of like, you know, you're almost like a sucker if you kind of play the game, you know
*  Also fame is like much more attainable. Yeah to regular people now than ever before
*  Yeah, you know, especially if you're willing to do stupid things like pull pranks on people or you know
*  There's so many different things that people can do now that can get them attention
*  Yeah, and they're they're doing that as a source of a career
*  Yeah, but why as a as a teacher, how can you make your kids do work when they're like, no, I'm just gonna be a youtuber
*  I have more followers than you like shut up
*  Well, but the whole idea of fame is like when I was growing up is like you don't want to be famous
*  That's like for you know, like whatever that's like that's not cool
*  You know, you want to be you know, something like rough, you know
*  You want to be like a what like a lumberjack or something?
*  You know like now these kids even at young ages to like fame is where it's at
*  That's where you get everything you want people actually listen to you and they you know, give you everything you want
*  So it's like amazing. They've never worked a day in their life yet. They already know they don't want to work
*  You know, I saw the creepiest thing my friend's daughter took her phone and recorded her five years old and into the camera
*  She just kept going don't forget to like and subscribe
*  Don't that's like and subscribe. That's watch my videos. Don't forget to light and I was like dude
*  This is that's an alien
*  Being trained to be an alien not the kids choice and you're exposing the kid of the world. Yeah world. It's it's dangerous
*  It's not smart. It's stupid. It's
*  Irresponsible. Yeah, well just like that that video we watch with the drone like psychically. We're not supposed to see that
*  Well, you're definitely not supposed to see people get blown to well
*  Yeah, but even even just now like we yes these things happen
*  But we shouldn't be aware of it and inundated with it every single day in every single second, right?
*  But that's the only way you find out about it to put pressure on people to stop it
*  Because if it doesn't leak like Edward Snowden doesn't put it out there and a bunch of people don't retweet it and get outraged
*  By it then it doesn't put pressure on the politicians
*  I'm gonna stop it or they can yeah stuff stuff like that can change things
*  Yeah stuff like that changes people's minds stuff like that changes people's understanding of what's actually going on because you keep hearing
*  Oh, no, it's the people that are dying. It's only Hamas
*  Uses human shields. Well, clearly that was not a human shield
*  Yeah, and clearly those people weren't endangering anybody and they didn't look like they were armed and they just blew him apart
*  Do you think the people making money off of this? Like do you think they really even care? They're gonna keep going
*  they're gonna care because the people are gonna care because there's massive public outrage from things like this and
*  The more things like this happen the less support you get for military budgets
*  And then you put pressure on the politicians that are voting for these things and then you know all that stuff works
*  It really does have an impact because they don't want people to be so outraged that they revolt
*  They don't want people to pull a bud light on the whole government. Yeah, you know because
*  People are trying to figure out a way to do that
*  There's a lot of people that are trying to figure out a way to like put a stop to all this shit
*  So the more things like this come up, it's fuel for those people
*  Yeah, but the majority of people don't digest news like we do in like a you know, endless cycle
*  you know and like have time to really kind of think about it because I think that a lot of people I know of like
*  They're really smart people. They just turn the news off
*  They want rather live in their own bubble that the news really makes them anxious and really makes them and I'm like
*  Well, you got to know what's going on in the world, right?
*  And then they kind of hit you with that whole thing of like, you know, they're telling you different like, you know
*  Everyone has a narrative and all that kind of story
*  But I'm also like, you know living in your own world is not the way to go either because like when you do have to venture
*  Out of that bubble, it's it's terrifying
*  I think especially like if you don't know what's going on, right?
*  If you don't like there's some new thing that's happening some new crisis. So you don't know you just walk right into it
*  I mean, yeah, it's like as like, you know, I'm like curious like I'm just like I'd like to see all sides of something
*  But not to make it political or anything that I think a lot of these people just decide to like, you know what?
*  It's not for me
*  I'd rather kind of like work on my own
*  You know some of its mental health if just a lot of this stuff really shakes people to the core when they finally have to
*  Deal with it. So, you know, I
*  That's a reason why like board games are still around because people love the idea that you can disconnect
*  From the world and like you're in like your own little world where you get to be God and here's the rules of it
*  And stuff like that. So, you know, there's something to that puzzles, you know, that's why
*  Hello
*  Believe to me
*  For sure people like puzzles no people people want to disconnect that's like we're in that business people want to get out get away
*  From their problems, you know fuck yeah, and I think people deserve to
*  But also like if you're poor and you barely make against me like you don't have time to worry about what's going on over here
*  Like sure you can be informed but it's so hard to be informed and not let it take a toll on you
*  Well, that's why the great luxury is the people that go out, please don't do that. I'm not I wanted to see if your message came
*  The great left. I'm gonna text somebody with that fucking goofy thing. The great luxury
*  Like rich privileged kids is becoming an activist. Yeah, that's right
*  Those are the ones that are splashing paint on the Mona Lisa and gluing themselves to walls
*  Yes, are all kids from privileged backgrounds who feel guilty and they have this
*  Insane view that you're just gonna stop oil now and the way to do is to glue yourself to them the Mona Lisa
*  But that's been going around since you know, the 70s. There was a lot of rich kids that were involved. Of course
*  It's always rich kids. Yeah, because those are the kids that have the luxury of being able to go out and protest and
*  I think it's like inherent guilt too. Oh my god. I feel so bad. What can I do?
*  100% especially today. Yeah, you're being told that just by virtue of the color your skin your colonizer
*  Yeah, you're responsible for everything and there's people like some of these people that are in these
*  Protests they haven't thought shit out at all. So they get confronted by
*  Influencers, right and they ask him like real simple questions to get them riled up. Like what do you think we should do?
*  We need to like give it this country. You don't understand. We're trying to dissolve the country
*  Does it get away from the capitals get away from the capital? Yeah, dude, I saw the best thing
*  I went to a rally or like a no a protest and
*  It was it was during the summer of 2020 and you know
*  everyone's like marching and everything and I want to go check it out and this this girl was wearing like an a cab shirt and
*  chanting like
*  NYPD races police and a cop was like, excuse me miss. You can't stand here and she goes. Oh my god. I'm so sorry
*  I
*  Started protesting again. I lost all her credit fucking free breaker. What the fuck?
*  Sure, that wasn't a skit
*  That sounds like a skit. I saw it with my own eyes. Oh must be real. Yeah, there's no way it could be fake
*  Yes, it was not thank you saw it. You know, right? No, I was you right there
*  Next to me that wasn't a crisis actor cuz that sounds like if I saw that one on an Instagram would be like, come on
*  No, no, I was there like it happened right next to me and I was with my buddy and we just started laughing
*  How dumb is that? Yeah, and then I was I was in Central Park for one and I swear to God
*  This guy had a sign and this super hot fucking girl went up to him and goes can I borrow your sign?
*  Grabbed it turned around took a picture gave it back and left. Yeah
*  Model it was stolen power young guy just trying to trust anything today. Oh
*  anything
*  Well, what about why are you always at these protests you're not in them
*  Is that like the guy who goes to see the fires? I'm like, you're like this observe like a wannabe fireman like I like
*  Good job guys. Yeah. Yeah. Oh you used to Halligan bar good work
*  Yeah, I was a volunteer firefighter in high school. I loved it. Were you really in high school? Yeah before 9-eleven Wow
*  Fighting fires. It's a great gig
*  What if you're not fighting fires? It's a great gig to be a fireman
*  Yeah, don't have to fight the fires right? Oh, yeah life and go into a burning building
*  Well, I was in the firehouse you're watching movies
*  Always in the pool room playing pool so I could slide down the pole and everybody beat me running down the stairs, but I didn't care
*  Yeah, I did it
*  From like
*  16 or whatever day to 18 and I was a junior firefighter
*  So I wasn't allowed to fight fires in the interior
*  I could just so from the exterior and then we would go we were like the bitches we to go and clean everything up
*  And clean the trucks and then I fought a car fire once at 2 a.m
*  Because I live close to the house so you could hear the sirens
*  I showed up and was meeting two other guys was all volunteer and they let me fight the fire myself
*  And I was so nervous
*  Helmet on and I like pop the hood my helmet falls off and and I left the hose running it was like
*  It was like a Charlie Chaplin movie. It was hard. It was hard. It was so embarrassing. They're just in the truck laughing like sorry
*  That's one of my fears the car fire. I mean, that's a horrible death
*  Yeah, oh no, it was a yeah. No being in it
*  One of the worst ones I've ever heard is Northern California the wildfires
*  Yes, warm the highway. Oh, yeah, everybody in their cars. Oh
*  Bumper-to-bumper can't get away
*  That's like hell on earth when they have the family driving like trying to drive to safety and you just see all that sparks and all
*  Fuck man, dude. I've been evacuated three times living in California. No, yeah fire burn two houses in front of my house
*  Yeah, and what do you do? Like are you out there with a whole like are you like what's the move?
*  You got out right? What do you grab?
*  Nothing grab the laptop grab the laptop and some clothes Mike can get everything else
*  Fuck this place. Do they have it?
*  That's what it's like man when you see it when you see like
*  Everything over the horizon is fire. Yeah, I mean from the left to the right everything coming over the hills is fire
*  That's crazy, and it's just engulfing buildings. You're seeing your neighbor's house on fire
*  you just get the fuck out while you can and
*  What I haven't so they just did
*  Supposedly they have enough rain now for like till 2025 in California
*  They're saying like this should help like both the consumption and also with all that snow up in the northern, California
*  That it should like be like if there's a forest fire now, what is that?
*  Well, see this doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter if you have a wildfire like they had where those people died on the highway
*  Those things are so big. You can't even comprehend it
*  It's it's so hot. There's so much fire
*  It's literally thousands and thousands of acres around you are just engulfed in flames and it's moving at like 20 miles an hour
*  Like you you ain't there's nothing happening that you're gonna do with water
*  Okay, the other problem with getting a lot of rainfall is you get a lot of growth?
*  So you get a lot of grasses wild grasses grow and they they're very tall and then they dry out because it stops raining
*  It always fucking does and everything turns brown and as soon as things get hot and everything turns brown and stops raining
*  That's when fire season happens and it's a lot of it is fucking idiots throwing cigarettes out the window
*  Sorry, a lot of it is people that are camping homeless people and gender reveals
*  They have the fireworks at the gender reveal everybody loses their house
*  How about like those guys the smokejumpers whatever the people that do that that's a balls gig
*  But they didn't have that in Hawaii. They had nothing like that there like when that town went up, you know
*  It was all made of bamboo. I mean, it was crazy. Oh, you mean Maui Maui things crazy
*  Yeah, it was power lines down. Oh, that was it wasn't response time. Terrible. It was non-existent
*  Yeah, they never had anything like that happen there
*  Yeah, but there was also a lot of problems like the people didn't want to release the water
*  Like the people didn't want to release the water because the water is owned like there's water rights
*  I know water was going to the rich neighborhoods where the golf courses are
*  So it's like I'm trying to get water and then there's also like how the fuck do you have a place?
*  That's this windy where you still have exposed power lines
*  That seems insane man
*  That seems insane like every time those things fall down and you didn't clean up any of the brush around it
*  Was that the conspiracy that they were trying to get it out of there so they could sell the land?
*  Yes, the crazy conspiracy is the direct energy weapons conspiracy
*  Bro the real tin foil had to is though the corner
*  Yeah, like the what do you think about the director and energy weapon in Maui?
*  Was that like a heart attack gun for fires?
*  it's there's apparently the government has the ability according to the conspiracy theorists of
*  and maybe even some real people the of
*  Having these things that they call direct energy weapons. So it's almost like a laser beam
*  And I know that these are things that they're working on
*  I know these are things that are probably top secret because it's it's always been discussed
*  there's been studies on how to do it and
*  There's been papers written on it
*  So the conspiracy theory is that they lit those houses on fire on purpose with direct energy weapons
*  And if you had a blue house like a with a blue ceiling that the blue ceiling would somehow
*  Reflect against this energy weapon and stop your house from burning. No way
*  Oh, yeah, not only that but they use because Biden did some speech and in his you know
*  Old kind of senile way he was talking about some houses survived because they had the right roof and everybody's like see
*  Yeah, so conspiracy theorists like literally painting their roofs blue to protect them from direct energy weapons
*  Jamie, please Google this no way. This might have been one of those things that 4chan started for a fuck
*  For
*  And then people ran with it who knows or it might be just people that are either
*  Can you imagine your house burning up because like your wife or partner was like no don't paint it blue
*  operation green
*  No way part of the conspiracy
*  What does that mean? What is operation one post on acting about getting people blue tarps to cover their roofs?
*  That's not the same thing as well the 10th legedly
*  I
*  allegedly but the
*  This the okay social media post sharing the post typically include a video
*  From a tik-tok account that often shares clips of everyday items being burned by hand
*  Handheld industrial laser in a workshop the clip shows a laser burning yellow red and green fabric while a blue swatch is unscathed
*  With tech saying it can be programmed for different wavelengths
*  Wow, so some lasers don't work on blue ceilings and these people think that it's the the blue roof
*  Someone said everything that's blue survived including t-shirts a
*  Blue car and some blue beach umbrellas around front street along the waterfront were not destroyed in the inferno and the blue man group
*  They were playing in town
*  They were doing a road gig
*  That is that is really stretching it if you ask me. Yeah, they're going hard on this. This is too much
*  Dew stands for direct energy weapons which use technology like high-energy lasers instead of projectiles like bullets
*  These videos are not evidence that they have anything to do with the wildfires to start with they show what is the videos are saying?
*  handful of blue items in the fires aftermath, but other footage and photos show these were
*  Hardly the only things left standing so but the thing about the the direct energy weapon
*  Videos of those things being used like is there like a is a direct energy weapon a real thing like 100%
*  Yeah, so when you I mean, I think it's true. It's like what you said lasers
*  So there's like videos of the US government talking about direct energy weapons
*  Yeah, and you know very broad terms. It's only like 15 bucks a shot
*  Now they were saying that this will be the best way to like shoot down missiles and dry energy lasers and high-powered microwaves
*  They just shot that thing nice
*  Nice so they just shot that out of the sky
*  But it's coming from a boat onto a boat that's I don't know
*  And so what is it?
*  Lovely typing type. No, isn't it?
*  He's an Asian guy. It would be an airborne Ranger the computer guy. We only let Asians and
*  Is DII does it show what is that video at the bottom? Why the US military is investing billions?
*  Well, yeah, I guarantee that's cool because they know how to do it
*  But by the time they're telling you they're investing billions. They probably already rest in billions. Sure. They probably figure out there was a video
*  Video claiming hola
*  Claiming to show a directed energy weapon is actually an edited clip of an explosion in Russia
*  Man, this is there was a video of
*  What looked like a laser coming out of the sky?
*  Yeah, I saw that and like during a storm somebody explained that that's that's cell phone video cameras like
*  glitching under the intense
*  exposure of like a lightning bolt
*  Well, it's something that light flashes and it creates like a distortion in some cell phones. I don't know if that's true though
*  Those just so it's a natural someone has it's a natural thing. It's not would that look like show that again
*  I don't know what I was even looking at that lady the video that you just show I know but I'm trying this I
*  Don't know what the hell they're showing because I can't hear the sound it's showing all sorts of stuff
*  They're talking about whoa just images that were going viral during it
*  Some of them are real some of them are not good or smiling see like right there for instance
*  That's a controlled burn at a Canton refinery in Ohio and because of that light going to the sky, right?
*  Rainbow
*  SpaceX launch
*  That's interesting that people are doing that
*  But that's people some people are in their fucking minds. There's a thing that happened though on Twitter, too
*  I like I feel like this doesn't get talked about sometimes people are trying to get engagement money because if you build up an account
*  That can get engagement doesn't matter if it's good engagement bad engagement. You just got to get the numbers
*  You can start getting revenue. So
*  People are reposting real old viral videos
*  Confusing people with ship right right right just to build up the five million views
*  Here's the real conspiracy about the fires like they haven't done any rebuilding
*  Those people they weren't allowed to have insurance inspectors go in there. I don't know if they can now
*  That people still had to pay their mortgage on those things
*  Oh jeez and the thing is it's like if you're getting to this point where you don't have anything and
*  You're you you can't rebuild your house and you're fucked and then they come along and offer you a payment or something
*  Or you get foreclosed on because you haven't paid your mortgage and then the banks own it and then whoever the fuck is
*  Developer owns and then whatever they want to do for the better good of Maui
*  They build there and then these people lose everything. This is what's really scary about it
*  It's because like the way it's being handled is not like you're handling victims of a natural disaster
*  That's horrific and took more lives than any wildfire in the history of this country
*  You're doing it like you are trying to figure out a way to take that from those people
*  You're not doing it like you're trying to support those people and build it back
*  You're doing it
*  Like if you know what's really going on you're not asking for financial aid for these people to deal with their mortgages
*  And you're not asking for aid from the government in one of those giant Ukraine bills
*  It would take five billion dollars, right? Wasn't that what the money was five billion to rebuild all those houses?
*  That that's a drop in the bucket to what they're spending yeah in Ukraine
*  Yeah, and there's no consideration at all to do something for these fucking people that seems like you don't want to do anything
*  They declared an emergency. I know when it happened like a
*  Federal like that usually means they can activate all federal funds and those people got a one-time payment of 700 bucks
*  For stimulus checks, yeah, that's an outrage. Yeah
*  Well, well fucking FEMA when Hurricane Katrina hit I went down to help like clean up and rebuild homes and stuff
*  And they sent us to Foley, Alabama
*  Because they still didn't get relief from Hurricane Ivan like years prior. Well, so there were still homes
*  That's roofs blown off from Hurricane Ivan
*  So did they tell them we're gonna send out some high school firemen?
*  Don't don't hang up the phone
*  We're sending some kids don't let them go to your strip. They're not popular in high school, but they want to be firemen
*  They have all the weekend open. They don't have dates or friends
*  That's what I like I know a guy just took the MTA test and now he's an MTA guy
*  You know, that's the guy drives the trains in the subways
*  So I'm like, I wonder what kind of training they give them now because it's more than just driving a train
*  It's got to be like, you know, you got to make a choice now
*  Yeah, all right learn more to the station or do you hit the hit the homeless man who's on the tracks?
*  Like what do you do? You know, like all kinds of hypotheticals. Yeah, how many times the homeless people get got down there?
*  There's so much going on in that station like not even homeless people how many people get pushed by oh, yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, so it was push she had both of her feet. Yeah amputated right off
*  Oh, the videos are the best because the people videotaping it aren't upset about the loss of human life
*  They're upset cuz they're late to their late. Yeah, like I got somewhere to be. Yeah, so crazy
*  Yeah, so crazy pushing people onto the tracks things is fucking terrifying. I think that's new if you ask me
*  Yeah, something that's only the last couple of years
*  Also, it's just so scary because it's random at like 8 a.m. At a popular station, you know
*  330 on the work commute
*  Do you know how much that's gonna ramp up with?
*  people coming in from
*  everywhere around the world and not having any jobs that were promised to them and being angry at everybody and knowing they can get away with
*  Crime and already being over already committing murder in your country and you got away with it
*  And I hear you are in America and also you're doing fentanyl
*  multiple
*  And multiple people that are doing the pushings have been
*  Locked up so many times and their family like this person is sick
*  Yeah, we've tried we've dropped them off at a hospital and they keep getting released. We don't know what to do
*  But what can you do really? But what what can't the government use one of those lasers?
*  This is after the Reagan administration
*  Yeah, they all the nutty people on the street. Well, how rather there was a guy who took that
*  You know, he did that documentary on Creed. What was it? Like it was this Al Capone's vault
*  but it was like it was like one of those but he went to like
*  Asylum an asylum and he just saw people laying in their own filth and just how horrible it was and that was the beginning
*  Of the basically the defund these psychiatric hospitals with it through medication
*  They were allowed to release them into society and and that's where people now like we really could use an asylum
*  And then incentivize workers with high pay to have smart people with compassion working there not just bottom of the barrel
*  That's a tough. Yeah, that's where the Willowbrook. Yeah
*  This is talk about something that's hard to why is this thing here man landmark investigation of Staten Island's Willowbrook State School an institution for the
*  Developmentally disabled it's their expose they forever changed the face of mental health
*  My alma mater but that's the fucking horrible thing about people and they can get away with doing things
*  When no one's like a rollover or somebody else is like breathing down their neck trying to find out what the fuck is going on
*  That's institutionalized you know
*  But that's what people did back then they put them in these places get them off the streets
*  Yeah, you know and now people are looking at it going like you know, maybe that's a good idea
*  You know
*  I used to work at a at a sober living house and one of the kids was like severely autistic and his family would just send
*  Them to different rehabs and sober living houses because he was so difficult to deal with and would just say he had a problem with marijuana
*  And then the kid learned how to smoke crack
*  From people in the houses yeah, they ended up dying in a crack house. It's like the saddest thing ever yeah
*  What this poor kid was that sadder than those guys getting drone bombed well
*  It's it's magic living in Gaza. You're just fucked
*  Yeah, and you just like going oh my god. Let's walk back and see if there's anything there
*  Yeah, but imagine really army is targeting you yeah, but imagine going to a crack house thinking you're gonna color with some guy
*  Killing you yeah, that's not good either. I don't know if it's the saddest thing. It's definitely sad
*  It's it's parallel sad, but the sober living house like what how does that work? It's all sad. Yeah, what do you mean?
*  I've only seen it on that show of the you know with dr. Drew the sober living house like what is it like?
*  Have you lived in one? Yeah, what's it like like you have chores and you know?
*  I lived in a three-quarter house an Oxford house in Delaware. Yeah, and so it was self-run
*  So we had we had everyone had a role like a comptroller or treasurer or chore coordinator or president of the house
*  And we kept each other accountable
*  but sober living house like a
*  halfway house you've house managers and
*  Clinical assistants and everything that basically like babysit you and take you and you have to have a job besides working there
*  Right living there you have to have a job. Yeah, you help them get jobs and everything and then I
*  Yeah, and then I got fired for drinking
*  It didn't end well. That's like the first first rule. Yeah, I didn't see that. I didn't write a book
*  Oh, right. Did they give you a warning or is this one time? Oh out out?
*  Yeah, and I they didn't catch me I came to them and was like I fucked up
*  I was on the road and I took a two-week bender and it was bad and I came back and got fired
*  Well, wow, so were you clean when you came back?
*  To the house. Yeah
*  Are we still drunk? No, I mean like I hadn't drank yet that day but I'd left to get cocked. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  So did you just stand in your once you were fired? Did you just get in your car and get loaded in front of the house?
*  I love that expression. I went to get cocked
*  That's a great fucking drunk expression. Oh, yeah getting cocked. Yeah, that's what I know a guy who was in a rehab and that
*  He told me we were like looking out the window and he told me goes you see all those cars over there
*  Those are all drug dealers. They're just waiting for some guy to go
*  I've had it and they'll come out no and they'll like immediately sell them drugs and it was like
*  It was kind of like the shark circle in the shark cage
*  Yeah, I kind of like they're just out there like and I'm like, wow that shouldn't be allowed
*  You know like I'm like an idiot, you know, you shouldn't be there
*  Celebrate they're like, yeah
*  Nice day
*  Like the slither snake. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they don't want to lose a customer
*  That's the best way to get him back when they're vulnerable. Oh for sure right out
*  Well that dude back to that book dreamland
*  It talks about these these Mexicans from Naira bringing black tar heroin to America and how it exploded was because of their customer service
*  Yeah, they would they had a paging system. They had cell phones
*  They would give addicts extra and it'd be like hey, it's on the house
*  Good customer and then when they didn't hear from for a while since they had their numbers they call them
*  Yeah, how are you? Do you want to meet up? We have some new heroin if you want to try it out. Yeah, man, I do
*  Yeah
*  God
*  At the right time, you know what Jose I'll see in five minutes. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, it was like dominoes
*  Way worse doesn't call you. Are you hungry?
*  In would you like a pizza fuck I would like a pizza one on the house Ian. Yeah, you guys are the best
*  I'm a little short on funds right now. Yeah, don't worry about it Ian and there
*  Is your friend their number one export that they would use all their money
*  The the drug dealers was Levi's 501 jeans and they would bring it back to their families and that would show
*  Everyone in naira like wow, we have money now
*  So they would they would raid these places and the closets would be stacked floor to ceiling with jeans really
*  Yeah, with an iron crease in them
*  Only I was always like man. Why do they why do they do that? It's never gonna be slacks. It's jeans
*  They're like no, that's how we like it. Yeah, who's their sign of opulent? Yeah
*  Well, you ever go to like Houston they always have like that Tex-Mex cowboy bar like where you're not really supposed to go in there
*  It's for other people and like those guys are dressed up, you know, they got the jeans iron
*  They got the big gallon on you know, it's like a big night out and I'm always like man good for these guys, man
*  And then of course is some kind of shots fired in the parking lot something terrible happens
*  But you know, you're like they're cowboys, you know, of course
*  Yeah, you know, this is you know unforgiven here. There's some issue, you know some of the cows
*  Grazing rights or something
*  Those are cool towns though the you know, you know, you don't get that much anymore everything looks the same
*  Yeah, you know all these towns are the same now
*  There's no late-night food. No nowhere. Well, actually I think this might be a city still have it. No way
*  Well, we just have pizza and deli still open. Yeah, it's like $35 for
*  Night if you want a Vegas drama sandwich at 4 in the morning, you should be willing to pay $35
*  I'd be willing to pay but it's not open. It's like Vegas
*  We were just in Vegas that has like late night food and it's pretty good that what was that place you took?
*  Oh ping-pong pong. That's a real place
*  It's open really it's like 24 hours. Yeah Wow. Yeah, and you think the people who work there are angels because they look exhausted
*  I mean you're in a casino working at a Chinese food rather like all it's everything you would think but then you're like
*  Hey, this food is really good. Yeah, I can't believe the best Chinese I've ever had really
*  Yeah, I got their chopsticks logo tattooed on me
*  And there's a restaurant inside
*  Encore at the win the win hotel
*  the win has like a
*  Michelin star Chinese restaurant in it. I think it's the only restaurant the only Chinese restaurant in the country
*  I think that has a Michelin star or one of the only ones it's
*  Incredible. I'm that place called Jamie
*  It's incredible it's like what is it called wing wing wing lay yeah, or wing Lee they
*  Yeah, I mean they don't help. They sound really racist when I'm naming my favorite Chinese restaurant
*  Yeah
*  Tang well worse Chinese restaurant in America to earn a Michelin star
*  Whoa, but those are normal hours like that's not there tonight. That's like a restaurant. It's a real restaurant
*  You have to dress nice too like you can't wear like a well woke fried main lobster, dude
*  It sounds so good walk
*  We ask its permission you've taken me
*  What was gonna say?
*  Yeah, there it is. I'm impressed with Vegas. I mean Vegas has really turned the corner
*  Oh Vegas is a different place and it's a total different you see it too, right?
*  It's like also Vegas became much more about entertainment than just about sure and also like the the sphere is a good example of like
*  What is possible like I'm sure that's just the beginning of it. You know yeah with that kind of money
*  We went to the battle bot arena there listen when you drive through Vegas and just the neon and all the craziness
*  It's fucking amazing. It is amazing. It's amazing and I did shows that wise guys was a great club by the way in Vegas
*  The locals came out and they were so happy to see a show like usually it's casino or whatever bigger only
*  But just to have like a regular club there is really cool, too
*  And there's there's a bunch, but this is off the strip. It's way off
*  So it's mostly for the locals so it was kind of refreshing to see the locals come out and let's say is there a more
*  Jaded crowd than a Vegas crowd you know they've seen it all yeah, so they were really cool
*  And I like big I feel like Vegas has turned the corner man. It's really it's popping now
*  Yeah, well, it's a peep place where people go to have a good time
*  So when you do shows there like you know doing shows you ever do the mirage I?
*  Think so in the past for sure that's that uh what is it the Terry Phaidor theater?
*  Yeah, he's
*  Was called that I think they changed it, but the fucking place is great. I was there with Gillis like a few months back
*  It's amazing you get in there. You're like holy shit. This place is incredible. Yeah, I forgot how fun
*  It was and it's like bunch of people there to have a good time. It's like that's what you want
*  You know people that are just like purposely. I'm here to have a good time. I want fun
*  I'm in a town that's specifically designed to have a good time. That's the first place
*  I saw the axe throwing stuff
*  They have like new ideas like for some reason people will bring new ideas and they'll like Vegas
*  You know people want to you know what's the next thing that people want to do?
*  What do they want to try so I think that's a good place like if you have an idea and you want to see people
*  Are into it. That's the place to do it. You know yeah, so that's where you'll see a lot of these robots and stuff like that there
*  They'll have a robot wrestling or somebody robot prostitutes. They'll sure unleash them
*  That's be the first place they do it in Vegas
*  And you know the weed thing there too
*  Which is weird that their weed laws are you can buy it
*  But you can't really smoking on the street or in the hotels or anything that so I don't know where people actually smoking that weed
*  But that just added another layer
*  It's like an Airbnb for smoke breaks just on top of the stratosphere
*  Battle box arena, but there is the sad of Vegas and let's face it
*  There's some like you know you go to old Vegas, and you're like walking down those streets
*  It's sad, but there's definitely a lot of sad in Vegas
*  There's some fun to it too though, and that's all those museums like this crazy museums there if you're gonna have gambling you're gonna have failure
*  You have people who just fucking hit the rocks yeah at 400 miles an hour
*  4 a.m.. You can't put the penny slot people lose everything
*  People have you ever seen those videos of people just peeing in their seats because they don't feel like getting up no
*  Yeah, this is girl
*  These girls sitting there on her phone, and she's sitting at one of the slot machines. She's just pisses a
*  Girl or a woman a lady was she look she's just sitting there pissing. She's kind of hot on the phone
*  She says I'm just gonna fucking piss so she's just pissing
*  While she's sitting, but that's she doesn't look like a degenerate. She's just drunk. She's probably both. She's
*  Oh, that's weird. She's probably drunk. She's just pissing on the ground in front of everybody lucky graham people are filming it
*  And she's got like a beautiful purse my shoes. That's in Vegas. Yeah, it doesn't really
*  Wow
*  What casino is that at Jamie?
*  Woman peas while gambling a casino she refuses to go to the bathroom, so she doesn't ruin her
*  Look caption out of it. Is there any what it's not what it is
*  Yeah, well yeah like what if it's coming from her bag or she put a drink in between her legs
*  What a weird ad for she's really turned on um I would like to just keep believing
*  What a weird it definitely looks like she's peeing I
*  Can't get over how hot you are apparently people do do that though. I've heard of talk to me
*  I was expecting someone in one of those school videos best. This is the one that went around viral right let's that's cuz she's hot
*  Don't they do that in Times Square at um everywhere with the ball
*  The people are being sitting everywhere don't people wear diapers because it's so crowded
*  You're not allowed to leave once you get in that so yeah security zone. They should all die
*  What was her if you're wearing a diaper to go see something and you can't pee well you're useless. Hmm anyway
*  Right that was weird
*  I'm not wearing a diaper today
*  Change my catheter it may be that option to just connected you would you like to be connected to the urinal?
*  Yeah, yeah sure just connect me and they just strap you in put you in a chair
*  And you just zip your dong just let it hang out you can pee at any time you're in a bag
*  You're gonna click like a blue dark bag. I hate as long as I hate that
*  Yeah, I do that those machines suck. I'd rather like play black check. I was playing them with you and the thing these some machines
*  It's like by the time you figure it out
*  You're already about a hundred bucks in to these dumb games
*  And then I'm like you know look at all this like information
*  And it's like you never know if you're winning or not
*  You know it's like why am I hitting my you know like an idiot you're hitting the butt waiting for a tree to come out
*  But I like the classic and you know it's just I was why don't people do it and then every time he came around me
*  I started losing. Yeah, I was a good dark cloud
*  Slot revenue made up sixty six point three percent of total gaming win Wow penny slots generated
*  9.6 percent of total slot win with three point one five billion, which is pennies
*  That's crazy, which is down twelve percent from twenty twenty two while slots that accept multiple denominations generated five point nine billion up
*  Sixteen point seven percent from last year so people are getting dumber people always have money to gamble
*  More money on slot machines. I'm a part of it
*  What's your biggest win on a slot what's your
*  Eleven hundred dollars and how many how long did it take you to get that I was there for like an hour
*  Oh, that's not bad if you had a guess though like how much are you in the hole to slot machines all time?
*  Joe
*  So much well, I mean I lost like three gram when I was in Vegas
*  Well I play a little roulette too, but I like how that's your backup game roulette. I understand
*  I
*  Guessing I'm guessing I lost $20 betting someone on rock-paper-scissors
*  Are you a sports guy too no, I don't like sports sports because we really can make it
*  Yeah, I don't understand the over-unders and the parlay
*  So yeah, but we've been to the track on the road and that's fun
*  Yeah, and that's another one where it takes forever to figure it out the trifecta is yeah quintel is and all those
*  other
*  Track junkies are weird folk. Oh, yeah, my uncle was one of them
*  He let me got me to pull the trigger on the start of a race once
*  It's a fun date though
*  Like if you take a girl like hey, this is kind of cool like we're the upper class
*  But it's like you're surrounded by some of the saddest people who've ever lived, you know the people who live at the track
*  Shit is off track betting. That's oh, yeah
*  Oh
*  My god in New York that off-track betting on Chinatown is everywhere gambling junkies would go and bet on the races from the middle
*  Of nowhere that was the most unhealthiest place like you would walk in it was like waves of smoke
*  Yeah, oh man, it was just terrible going in there. I remember people like with uh, I was like do you have a bathroom here?
*  I'm like, what are you talking about?
*  There's no bathroom here
*  Yeah, come on
*  They'd be taking showers in there
*  Yeah off-track betting was this guy white planes Charlie that he used to hang around with and uh
*  white planes in
*  Executive billiards in white planes and he would always go to off-track betting during the day and come back complaining
*  What is off-track betting? This is before the internet where you put it in and you'd be able to bet on races around the country
*  You know, so you're betting on horse races. Yeah, but you're nowhere near the horse race
*  And all these fucking psychotic gamblers these guys are nuts look at these people they're all just completely addicted they're all shady
*  Everyone's in there. Everyone's fucked their whole life up with this addiction. Yeah, how's my uncle man, and they're just donating money
*  You know, I remember I'm like the DMV. I was gonna say like I remember walking past
*  I was like is this like the cab authority is this like where the cabbies hang out?
*  Look how sad these guys look like give me a click on some of the folks hanging out there great
*  They just look like everything's gone wrong
*  Yeah, they're all just junkies the name of one of the horses government's plan it was a nice way to spend an afternoon
*  That's how they portrayed it on the commercial just a bunch of junkies. Oh god ghosts of wagers pass
*  Still living. Yeah, they close all this is all down
*  They don't have off-track betting. I don't think so. I think they make that illegal near the Manhattan Bridge
*  Do you think I think I know it's you may be a West Side
*  Cider makes documentary about off-track betting. Oh look that looks classy though with it. That's a nice. Yeah, that's a nice one
*  Yeah, that's the Upper West Side. They're betting on something besides horses there. I think
*  That's like falconry or something another level of animal
*  Well, there's always dog races too, yeah
*  I've been to those in person and they were a lot of fun really, you know in
*  They used to have the thing where they this was like a rite of passage or at a state fair where they had
*  Monkeys riding dogs and they were like this has got to end now and I'm like, oh come on. It's hilarious
*  You know and the monkeys would be like riding them around they'd have like a do a circle man. That was really fun
*  Everybody had a good time the dog the monkey everyone's having a good time
*  I saw a video today of India these folks are walking down this road and this monkey runs up behind and just drop kicks this
*  lady and then
*  Look at the dog he's easily distracted. You're taking a bow
*  To any of the monkeys rip the dogs faces off that's great
*  No, they know better than that dogs will bite their father. They friends like do they have any buddies?
*  The dogs don't seem to mind if the split the purse
*  For the dogs probably like being pet like yeah
*  He's riding me he's learned a little dress and they don't weigh much. Oh, that's so fun
*  So these people were walking down this road in India and this monkey runs up behind him drop kicks this one lady and then runs
*  a little further and drop kicks this little kid
*  Like 100% did it on purpose. That's great. Fuck these people. That's great a migrant
*  Runs up with its back feet like like a dropkick. Yeah, like a real like progress
*  They're trying to steal their purse or was not love of the game up. Just a lot of game
*  That's just drop some bombs on these fucking fools. That's the best
*  You've been served
*  Decided to fuck this dude up. Well, he's egging him on though. He's like fuck. Did he give him the finger?
*  He tried to my god. He tried to stand his ground. But yeah
*  What that guy was I hate say he was as thing behind yeah, he's so disoriented
*  So where's the monkey is this outdoors or is it indoors the one that I saw it was indoor or outdoors rather?
*  That is a little girl. Oh, yeah scary. It's a kill your fucking kids, man. This is crazy. Oh
*  Look at those tails man. Oh, they're dragging the girl. Oh, no. Yeah
*  Yeah, dude, that's sketchy. I
*  Would not let the monkey grab my fucking kid
*  No, then you gotta realize like they'll fuck you up like a little monkey will fuck you up
*  I can't treat it like it's a little person. They must think we're so stupid
*  Like they just keep feeding them and like I mean, well then a lot of places they'll take your phone
*  Yeah, already give the phone back. You have to give him something
*  That's smart rock him food. Yep. Can you train the monkey to take the phone and give it to you so you can sell it?
*  I'm sure you can and that's in like where's it?
*  We're like they live in like a monastery or a ruin or something like that
*  They kind of control the town I think it's in India or Thailand or something like that where it's like just troops of monkeys
*  Hundreds of them control traffic and they can't do anything. Yeah. Yeah, you can't fight them unless you're willing to go to war
*  You got to really be willing to go to war you got guns. What's your weapon? You got any machine guns?
*  Yeah, how would you fight the monkey army? Yeah, they're gonna swarm on you
*  You're gonna be able to you gotta be able to maybe even
*  Yeah, you need something that we don't think like a nice rounds. No
*  Take that mace around away from you stuff it up your ass
*  But you jump on your face and bite your nose off and then you drop the mace and then they beat you to death
*  You're fucked you got to have a motorcycle helmet on Kevlar suit there it is
*  Yeah, you got to look like Tex Cobb and raising Arizona exactly. No, but he was still vulnerable
*  Yeah skin was exposed. You want to literally be wearing like a motorcycle riding outfit made out of Kevlar
*  That's like two troops of monkeys going at it. Yeah, they're fighting look at that
*  Well, this was I think during kovat one of the things that happened during kovat was they didn't have access to all the tourists
*  So they're starving. Yeah, so they had to become dependent upon people and where people would hang out and leave food. Oh, you're right
*  Yeah
*  Look at those guys probably fucking star. Look, that's a nice spread though that they put out for them. That is pretty sweet
*  Yeah, that's good. So like one guy was dressed as a monkey
*  I'm infiltrating a nice little buffet. Look at this sort of sort of cool like a different plates of food like a Carnival cruise
*  Oh, you can eat
*  You would think they wouldn't steal any babies, but
*  They're so smart boy, he's their leader. I think that might be a statue is that a statue or a dude? Oh, yeah
*  That's like the God is there worshiped. Yeah
*  Wow. Wow. Oh that looks like rats like the way I know
*  Wow, oh
*  It's so why what people choose to and choose not to worship, you know, okay shaking it off like enough of the table boys
*  Boy what a fucking horrible life that is. Wow, imagine being a monkey in India
*  No tourists show up. You're like you gotta be kidding. Yes the food man if they only had dogs to ride
*  They could really make a difference story of
*  Cobra charmers no
*  Cobra charmers started because
*  They they started offering people money to kill cobras
*  And so what people realize is you could breed cobras and then kill those cobras
*  And so every Cobra you capture and kill they give you a little bit of money
*  So they started breeding cobras and so then the government got wise to and say hey
*  Stop, you can't do this. No more bounty on cobras
*  These fucking cobras and so they'd started fucking doing shows with them
*  But I don't remember the source which is often the case I don't remember the source of that story
*  We can't make these cobras fuck anymore
*  Yeah, they fucking mean it makes sense
*  Yeah, people are get a little people find ways
*  Where they native to that's India like where the Cobra's leave it's India India, right?
*  Yeah
*  I mean think about the people going back and forth from Mexico making eight thousand dollars a month like same kind of deal
*  people find a little loophole like
*  Breed Cobra, bro. I'm breathing making the criminals
*  How many cobras bite died breeding cobras?
*  Yeah
*  Sneaky thing I never heard for safety some North American shape snake charmers stitch close the mouth
*  They're performing snakes
*  Oh leaving just enough opening for the animal to be able to move its tongue in and out
*  Members of the audience in that region believe the snakes ability to deliver venomous bites comes from its tongue rather than its fangs
*  Snakes subjected to this practice soon die of starvation or mouth infection must be replaced by freshly caught specimens
*  Similar methods are used in India where snakes are defanged and have their venom glands incapacitated
*  They are also kept in boxes or bags for 30 to 45 days and dehydrated
*  So their muscles cramp making them sluggish so they will drink the milk offered by the devotees at festivals
*  The milk is undigestible to the snake Jesus Wow
*  Abuse methods of dealing with the fangs include expert surgical removal of both of the fangs and replacement fangs
*  Which has been done by some Native American and African snake charmers
*  Barring extraordinary measures pulled Frank fangs are replaced within days
*  Fangs may also be plugged with wax or other material
*  Well, it's so it's like a three-cord Monte kind of like you're thinking it's the guy could really died nothing get happened
*  Oh, right
*  But see if that's the origin of us that they used to Google that like if they used to give bounties for cobras
*  But people to get advantage of it pretty sure that's a real story
*  This has the history goes all the way back to ancient Egypt
*  Right a viper but in India what I'm talking about is the bounty on Cobra thing real money isn't being a snake dentist
*  Invented it but I'm saying like that's why where it came from like where there were so many of them
*  It was associated with India that these are people that
*  Apparently had a bunch of snakes laying around like look we need to figure out a way to fucking diversify
*  Wasn't that st. Patrick didn't he didn't he chase all the snakes?
*  But what are you supposed to do it's like a snake live in Ireland so cold
*  It's probably easy to chase him out there bring me back to Indian take my teeth out
*  What happens with the like what you supposed to tip that guy like I'm not it's like a street performance
*  This is an alarm article the first paragraph says legend goes that a Cobra investigation plagued Delhi in the 1800s
*  So the British Raj decided to offer cash reward for every dead Cobra the menace briefly
*  You're right
*  I didn't know the plan backfired savvy Indians built Cobra farms
*  So they could have a constant supply of snakes to kill and redeem for money. Yeah
*  Wow, you're right British eventually uncovered the scheme and ended its incentive with no use for the now worthless snakes breeders
*  Release the creatures onto Delhi streets Wow, you were right man
*  So it made the problem worse. That's right. That's what it was. Oh wow. I fucked up the story
*  No, you got you got a lot of it right?
*  worse
*  People are gross
*  Fuck these Cobra's just let them loose
*  You don't see that on New York streets anymore like with they're like performing dogs or any any of that kind of stuff
*  You don't see any kind of animal that's illegal, but you can go shit in the curb. Yeah, well, that's that's fine
*  Yeah, that's a purple
*  See somebody who's like, you know, I'm a squatter with a dog and the poor dogs there all day long
*  Just like laying next to that I was feeling are those dogs drugged or they so socialized that they're just docile
*  I think that's what they're used to living like that
*  But you're really giving money to the dog hoping that he'll take money and take care of the dog
*  But really without a dog is probably like 60% less effective
*  Mmm, almost got with a dog, you know my rough estimation. Yeah, you remember Norm McDonald's joke about the homeless guy with the dog
*  Wow, what is the dog thinking this is the longest walk ever are we ever going home?
*  Man, it's been going on for days now
*  That's a fucked up thing about dogs. They're so awesome. They'll love you. Yeah, just homeless and yeah, just fucking lazy as shit
*  And you never get anything done. They still like still love you. Yeah, it's real unconditional love
*  Beautiful my cat does that sure
*  You gotta eat you when you die cats have seconds good seconds, I'll be one with him finally
*  All right kids, let's wrap this bitch up bringing home in very fun. Thank you in here bless. Thank you brother
*  Thank you very much. Yeah, and I'm excited to see you guys this weekend. So you're the fucking man
*  I love you to death. You want the best of all time Joe. Thank you for all of us for doing what you do, man
*  Honestly, it was a great hang and the club. I can't wait to be there. So we're excited. Okay, that's it
