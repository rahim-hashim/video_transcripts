# Joe Rogan Experience #2228 - Josh Dubin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZkHwI7cX4Y)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's up?
*  Good to see you.
*  Good to see you.
*  So I guess we just get right into it.
*  The last case that we talked about, we had a very unfortunate incident happen after the
*  last, about a month later, the gentleman beheaded somebody.
*  Allegedly, yes.
*  Allegedly.
*  There's a lot of allegedlys, but there's so many crazy things to that case.
*  The craziest thing was him trying to fool the security cameras with a wig.
*  I guess he didn't know how high resolution cameras had gotten over the 25 years that
*  he was in jail.
*  I mean, apparently there's a lot he didn't know.
*  The only reason I say allegedly is because I'd be a bit of a hypocrite if I started
*  calling him guilty before he has a trial.
*  Of course.
*  But based on the surveillance.
*  It doesn't look good.
*  What do they say in Texas?
*  It ain't too shiny.
*  It's so crazy because we went out with him that evening.
*  We brought him to the comedy club.
*  He was hanging out with us in the green room and then the news broke and then the comics
*  broke.
*  Like, hey, man, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck are you doing bringing that guy around?
*  I'm like, well, we didn't know.
*  I mean, who could have known he was going to do that other than him?
*  I'm as shocked over it now as I was in the moment.
*  I mean, yeah, I don't.
*  You know, there are no words.
*  I went through.
*  It's really not funny.
*  I'm only laughing out of sort of nervousness, I guess.
*  Of course.
*  I mean, I was in St. Louis of all places, which is only memorable because that's where
*  I was when someone called me and said, have you looked at the news?
*  And I said I was in court and I was on a break.
*  And you know, I called him a miracle on this show.
*  Yeah.
*  The media shoved that straight up my ass.
*  I mean, of course.
*  But that's what they're going to do.
*  Well, he was the only guy that you had ever brought in that was actually guilty that you
*  felt was in jail for too long.
*  You know, he got a 50 year sentence, correct?
*  70.
*  70.
*  And it was reduced to 25.
*  It was just basically time served.
*  He did about 30 years and they re-sentenced him.
*  I would be...
*  I've had a lot of time to think about this and I know you and I have discussed it privately
*  and I kind of went into a hole after this.
*  This didn't happen to me.
*  A lot of people say, I'm so sorry.
*  Some people have said other things that weren't very nice.
*  The people that I regard their opinion were sorry that it didn't happen to me.
*  My first thought was, I had two thoughts, was that poor guy that got killed and it was
*  a gruesome murder.
*  You know, it wasn't just beheaded.
*  I think he was dismembered completely.
*  Well, he was trying to get rid of the body, right?
*  Allegedly.
*  Allegedly.
*  And my first thought was for him and his family.
*  And then I think my second and third thought maybe in tandem was this tore down 50 years
*  of work that a lot of people have fought really hard for and really need.
*  And I felt like I let you down.
*  You know, you've given us an amazing platform to get stories out for people that really
*  need help.
*  I think we've made a ton of progress.
*  We've got some exonerations as a direct result of this.
*  Yeah, you didn't let me down at all.
*  No, I didn't.
*  I appreciate that you felt like that.
*  It didn't feel like that to me at all.
*  It was just, listen, there's a reality of prison life.
*  There's a reality of being incarcerated.
*  There's a reality of taking a person who's convicted of a violent crime and putting them
*  in jail with violent people for 30 years.
*  It was just a reality.
*  And I don't know what history he had with this man that he allegedly killed, but you
*  can only take so much.
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't know.
*  My first emotion, this is for me and my therapist, my first emotion is usually guilt.
*  Once I took a little bit of time and thought it through, I mean, of course, I come on your
*  show and then you're splattered all over the news for something not positive.
*  Good news is I don't watch the news.
*  I don't pay attention and I don't listen to anything anybody writes about me.
*  So it didn't bother me at all.
*  You're rare.
*  Look, for me, I have to take a hard look at what I'm doing and take the mirror out and
*  look straight in it and say, what did I do wrong?
*  You did nothing wrong.
*  Well, well, I don't think you did anything wrong.
*  You just, listen, the man had great qualities.
*  When you talked to him, he's very intelligent, very nice guy.
*  He just thought he could get away with getting payback on somebody.
*  Yeah, look, that's super gracious of you.
*  Whether I did something wrong or not, I typically go to blame.
*  And that's something that I have to, that's a kink I have to work out in my personality.
*  But let me just articulate it because I think the platform is so important to me and getting
*  these stories out is so important to me.
*  And I think that where I've landed is that he didn't let me down.
*  He didn't let, look, I was the public face of his resentencing.
*  There was a lot of great people involved.
*  And it wasn't just from the defense side.
*  The Center for Appellate Litigation had some amazing people working on his case.
*  The District Attorney of Manhattan agreed to this.
*  So on paper, even in their personal interactions with him, there was nothing that raised a
*  red flag for anyone.
*  He didn't let anyone down if he did this, which people will draw their own conclusion
*  and have a trial.
*  He didn't let anyone down if he did this but himself and the people that still need help.
*  And I have to swallow the jagged pill that this work comes with some letdowns.
*  The recidivism rate for people that have served long sentences like that is less than 1%.
*  It just happened to happen on a case where I was involved.
*  I have no...
*  Is it really that low?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  If you look at exonerations, resentencings of people that have been incarcerated for
*  more than 20 years, it's that low.
*  And you know, the harsh reality is that if you put someone on a public platform and they
*  then do what he supposedly did, it's going to make headlines.
*  I realize something though that...
*  Look, no one could have imagined what's in the dark recesses of that man's soul, whether
*  it's his group home upbringing and abuse, the prison experience.
*  It's not to make an excuse.
*  He did it if he did it.
*  If he's convicted and he did it, that's on him.
*  What I'm guilty of is giving a guy a second chance.
*  Why am I reluctant to say this?
*  I can't apologize for giving someone a second chance and then they squander it.
*  All I can do is say, what could I have done better?
*  I have a deep understanding, I think, of what incarceration means.
*  I read this book.
*  I always get his name confused.
*  Is it Henry Jack Abbott or Jack Henry Abbott?
*  It's called In the Belly of the Beast when I was in college.
*  And it's a series of letters that this inmate wrote to Norman Mailer.
*  A fascinating book.
*  And about what incarceration does to somebody from the standpoint of the practical day to
*  day, from the deep psychosis inducing confinement and everything else.
*  Two days before the book was released and it was reviewed by the New York Times, the
*  guy snapped and killed someone in the East Village.
*  And no one will know what it is like to be in there.
*  And again, I don't want to offer this as an excuse, but what it has caused me to do is
*  reevaluate and say, look, maybe I need to take a much closer look at what sort of mental
*  health counseling these folks are getting.
*  Like Sheldon, I arranged for him to be speaking to a trauma therapist.
*  Should I have been on him more to be going to those appointments?
*  Maybe.
*  What was the circumstances with the guy that he allegedly killed?
*  I don't know if I'm doing it just because I'm distancing myself from it subconsciously,
*  but I don't know all the circumstances.
*  But apparently this was someone he knew from childhood and from in prison.
*  I've heard rumors and stories about the guy threatened his son to he slashed Sheldon when
*  they were in prison.
*  I don't know if you remember Sheldon had this big gash across his face, but I don't know.
*  And I frankly don't want to know at this point because someone lost their life.
*  And that, you know, I think unfortunately for my mental health, I just wear that stuff.
*  If I felt even remotely responsible for that, which I do, and I have to, I can be at peace
*  with it, but I didn't cause that death.
*  And I don't, you know, I can take some responsibility for it in the sense that what
*  could I do going forward?
*  Whether it's people that are being exonerated for crimes they didn't commit, or if it's people
*  that are getting re-sentenced, you cannot undo decades of confinement.
*  You just can't.
*  And they all need mental health counseling, all of them.
*  And I have to put that on my shoulders.
*  I just do.
*  Because, you know, they all have issues.
*  And they come out and need mental health counseling.
*  And there's a stigma attached to it, especially in the African American community.
*  And there shouldn't be.
*  It's no different than if you have a problem with your liver, you know, and you have to
*  take medication.
*  I mean, I've always been upfront about the fact that I'm on medication.
*  It's nothing to be ashamed of.
*  And it's especially warranted when you're in those circumstances.
*  Again, none of this is to make an excuse, but I just think that there's a lot more emphasis
*  that I can focus on assimilation more.
*  And I think that making sure that they have job training and that they feel safe when
*  they get out.
*  I mean, there hasn't been one person who I've been involved in their case where even when
*  they're innocent, they get out and it's a fucking shock.
*  And I need to be a lot more sensitive to that, I think, and pay a lot more attention to
*  what they're doing, how they're doing.
*  Again, I had I had the foresight to put Sheldon in touch with and ensure that we were getting
*  him mental health counseling with a trauma therapist.
*  But, you know, I didn't want to meddle too much in that because it's on him to go.
*  So, I mean, that's where I land.
*  For better or for worse.
*  Well, I think I really did slash his face.
*  If you've been in literal mortal combat with a person and this person is allegedly threatening
*  your son or whatever, you know, there's only so much you can do to stop a person from
*  seeking revenge.
*  I guess.
*  Especially if they don't have any hope outside of the system and they've been completely
*  institutionalized, which given the length of his sentence is reasonable to assume.
*  Yeah, you're you're a lot more forgiving and understanding than
*  than a lot of people were and have been about this.
*  You know, I've had there's been two schools of thought in the reaction.
*  I mean, I got pretty nasty hate mail and I got a lot of words of encouragement.
*  I think the hate mail outweighed the words of encouragement.
*  Always.
*  But psychologically, always.
*  I mean, by in substance number and probably psychologically, you know, but
*  that shit just gives me fuel.
*  You know, if you're sending me fuck you, you race bait or you this, you that,
*  you know, you know, yeah, I got a lot of that.
*  How are you a race bait?
*  By telling the truth about the state of race and the criminal justice system in this country.
*  I see the thing is that one the one force field I have around myself is when that's
*  incoming, I'm able to say, OK, thanks for the fuel.
*  Thanks for the fuel.
*  I'll never respond to it.
*  You know, unless you're doing mental health counseling in a prison,
*  unless you're a corrections officer or a police officer,
*  know what it's like to be incarcerated.
*  You have no fucking business giving me your shitty opinion about what you think I am or
*  others that do this work.
*  Get in the fucking arena and do it yourself.
*  And I, you know, so I take that with a big grain of salt.
*  I had, you know, I have enough common sense and practical sense to sort of let to disregard that.
*  But I have to be a big enough person to look at myself and say, well,
*  can I learn from this and what could I do better?
*  Because, you know, I was talking to Derek Hamilton, who's been on the show and the
*  deputy director of the Freedom Clinic at the Perlmutter Center.
*  And, you know, Derek said, look, mental health counseling when I was incarcerated was something
*  that was like it flew in the face of the us versus them mentality.
*  I didn't think they could help me.
*  And I didn't want to want the help.
*  I was mad.
*  And there was a stigma attached to it that I was soft if I did it.
*  I didn't want people inside knowing.
*  So I don't.
*  We're trying to formulate a plan to normalize mental health counseling in prison.
*  So Derek and I are doing a town hall at Schuangang, which is a pretty rough prison in New York on
*  December 6 to try to get some of the inmates to understand that it's OK to ask for this help.
*  I think when they see Derek and hear his story, it's helpful for them.
*  So I'm going to say something that's going to sound pretty controversial.
*  But I think, you know, one of the one of the conversations that I've had repeatedly,
*  I had it with J.D. Vance.
*  I've had it with quite a few people is psychedelic therapy for veterans.
*  People with severe PTSD because of war, I think, are the most deserving of psychedelic therapy and the benefits of it.
*  And the fact that that stuff is schedule one and is illegal in the United States, I think, is absurd.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's a massive disservice to those people that put their lives on the line and went over and experienced
*  horrific things that the average person, myself, could only imagine.
*  And you're not going to do a good job of imagining it.
*  I think prisoners could benefit from psychedelic therapy as well.
*  I think there's a lot of people that could be rehabilitated by changing the way they view things,
*  literally changing their mind, changing their perspective.
*  And I think there's a lot of psychedelic therapies that could aid in that, particularly for people who,
*  you know, they're not violent people.
*  They're they're just had their victim of circumstance or they made bad decisions in their life or what have you.
*  And they're stuck and they're stuck both mentally and physically.
*  And if we want to use prisons as just a deterrent to crime, OK, I think we should probably put some
*  effort towards rehabilitation, you know, sincere, significant efforts towards rehabilitation.
*  And one of the best ways to do that is to try to change the way people view themselves and view the
*  world and view themselves as a part of the world.
*  The fact that you would even think that that would be controversial, I think, is just a byproduct of
*  the fact that anything that somebody articulates that's outside of like what's considered mainstream
*  is rejected.
*  Unquestionably, the research is overwhelming.
*  Overwhelming.
*  That psychedelics are one of the best, one of the best, most effective therapies for PTSD.
*  My therapist has, you know, counseled people with PTSD coming back from war and, you know,
*  has espoused the, not only the efficacy of it, but how remarkably
*  different it is from conventional therapies in the most positive of ways.
*  And I could not agree with you more.
*  I think that if you look at some of the European countries that look at their prison systems as a
*  real rehabilitative model, I mean, we have to decide that we, in part, we talked about the
*  stats and I'm not going to, you know, re-litigate that here, but look, we incarcerate people at a
*  higher rate than any other civilization on earth.
*  So we have to decide as a society, are we just going to throw people away and put them in cages
*  and make them worse, even if they committed the crime?
*  Or, as you said, are we really going to try to rehabilitate people?
*  Because some people are getting out no matter what.
*  Whether they have people like me involved and other great people that do this work,
*  but they're going to get out.
*  Do you want them out like they were just an animal let out of a cage?
*  Or do you want them out where rehabilitation is a cornerstone of their incarceration?
*  And it just doesn't happen in our criminal justice.
*  Well, there's a bizarre attitude in this country that we shouldn't do anything to make their life
*  better while they're in there, you know, and that something like psychedelic therapy is like,
*  that it's a luxury, you know, that it's something they don't deserve,
*  that it's something that should be reserved for good people.
*  Or that there's some like, it's for people that are like fucking off and, you know,
*  the others that do drugs, that whole mentality.
*  Sure, yeah, there's that too.
*  So yeah, listen, I mean, you talk about like looking up at the mountain and saying,
*  can I scale it?
*  I think what you have to do, and I'm talking about this, all it takes is one state,
*  one municipality, one person who says, that's interesting, show us the literature.
*  We have this amazing policy director at the Perlmutter Center named Sarah Chu,
*  and she's in the trenches having these arguments, having these fights,
*  trying to get forensic labs, you know, ensuring that they have the proper training,
*  accreditation, so that they're not introducing, you know, various forms of junk science.
*  All it takes is just the effort going forward to try to start pushing that boulder uphill,
*  or else, you know, again, this goes to, you know, the incoming hatred in a situation like
*  we had here is like, what the fuck are you doing to help try to make the situation better?
*  Because just calling names and pointing fingers and saying, you fucked up,
*  or this person that we threw away is not worth saving.
*  Listen, everybody has made some mistake that they wish other people didn't know about,
*  you know, and it's not always homicide, obviously,
*  but a lot of people have done something that, but for the grace of God of Goi, right?
*  Where if somebody was looking, if law enforcement was looking, it could be you that was there,
*  and would you want a second chance? Would you want redemption? Would you want the help
*  to overcome whatever demons? And I just think why psychedelics aren't, you know, looked at
*  ketamine, the little bit that I did, going through a dark time, it almost snapped me
*  in a different direction. And I mean, I, you know, you urged me on to it. I mean, you were the one
*  that said you should really think about this, and my therapist urged me on to it. And I think,
*  you know, so I know that the literature is there, it's just we have to get past this whole
*  thing. It's so weird that you mentioned that. I was talking to a guy on the plane on the way down
*  who was telling, asked me if marijuana legalization passed in Florida, because I was,
*  so we were talking about, you know, where are you from, this and that. And he was telling me that,
*  he was from Colorado. And he told me that, you know, in Colorado, when marijuana was legalized,
*  that there was this whole movement of people that were saying that it would be a gateway drug,
*  and that it was going to lead people down this slippery slope to doing other hardcore drugs.
*  And he said, you know, the gulf between smoking weed and turning into a meth addict doesn't exist.
*  He said that the bridge between the two doesn't exist. And if you start walking marijuana use,
*  and trying to link it to drugs that the US government considers a problem, the link just
*  isn't there. So, I mean, he was sort of trying to explain to me how he didn't understand how
*  marijuana is any different than alcohol. And I said, well, go tell that to the state legislature
*  in Florida. I don't know what to tell you. Did it not pass in Florida? It got 58%. And it needed 60%.
*  Really? Yeah. I don't get that. I just don't get...
*  Why would... It's fucking more than half the people. That should be it. Why did it need 60%?
*  That was the same thing with, you know, the amendment on abortion. It needed 60%. Maybe
*  it was the abortion one that got 58%. I might be wrong about that. But in any event, I don't
*  understand the resistance to psychedelics as a therapeutic, both in mainstream society,
*  let alone in the prison system. Well, it all goes back to 1970. It all goes back to the
*  Nixon administration, the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 that turned everything schedule one,
*  that was designed to... It was designed to cripple the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement.
*  That's what it was about. It was about having new tools to imprison people that were anti-war,
*  that were protesting the war. The Black Panthers, civil rights organizations, all these people that
*  were doing drugs, that were using psychedelics to try to achieve a different state of consciousness.
*  And that brought them to these ideas that we're all one and that war is evil and that the United
*  States government is being controlled by the military industrial complex and that this is
*  a giant problem in our culture. But people were so weirded out by the Timothy Leary's and the whole
*  tune in, turn out, whatever the fuck his motto was, drop out. This whole thing of leaving polite
*  society and being a loser and just traveling around and doing drugs in a van. This was the
*  perspective that people had that was going to take their kids and turn them into nerdwells and turn
*  them into losers. And that we were going to have a society filled with people that didn't understand
*  the ethics of hard work and what made America great and all this bullshit. Well, look, what's
*  born out of that is this misunderstanding, I guess is the best way to put it. Ignorance.
*  Well, it's propaganda. They're a victim of propaganda.
*  Well, look, also, if you think about like coin Intel Pro, all of a sudden you're spying on people
*  that you think are others. You're legalizing that intelligence gathering that allows you to
*  start violating people's civil liberties so that you can gain intelligence on them because the way
*  they think is unlike you. So, you know, it's again sort of to me, all ties back to this very,
*  I guess, tribal mentality that you're either like us or you're like them. And everything that you
*  mentioned, the psychedelics act, the resistance to the civil rights movement, it was all based
*  on the fact that, look, we have a potential uprising here of people that are going to
*  challenge the way we think and the way we do things. So for people that call me a race baiter,
*  right, I feel like I'm more of a truth teller and just taking the thread through history.
*  And, you know, I have, at least I'll read and try to educate myself and get perspective.
*  If it wasn't a fact that brown and black men and women get incarcerated at a higher rate,
*  I wouldn't be talking about it. And I'm just talking about facts. So I think that it's just
*  this tribal misconception about these are drugs and they're bad versus you sit and speak to someone
*  and take some, you know, pharmacologic form of therapy that has probably way worse side effects,
*  can be addictive, and can lead to a whole host of other issues that you then have to take something
*  else to address, versus just being having the openness to take a look at a different way to
*  potentially help someone. So I don't understand it. And the only thing that I can do is just to
*  keep on being open minded and, you know, try to figure out if there's other ways that we can
*  convince the people that are in these penitentiaries and that run them to allow programs that at least
*  give you a crack in the door to get in. Well, I think the way the doorway to that
*  is to first show the effectiveness with veterans and with other people that aren't incarcerated.
*  And that once that gets established, and once that becomes something I think it's much, much more
*  established now than it was when I first started talking about this stuff 20 years ago, you know,
*  like probably when I had my first experiences was a little more than 20 years ago. I think
*  people have this very ignorant idea that was born out of propaganda, because you have to think
*  20 years ago was only 30 years removed from the Sweeping Psychedelics Act. So you're dealing with
*  a whole society that's been just programmed by propaganda and lies. And that those propaganda
*  and lies were established in order to villainize this one group of the population that was
*  completely changing the culture. The difference in the United States culture from 1965 to 1955
*  to 1965 was so dramatic. It was such an enormous shift. You know, then you have the Vietnam War,
*  the protests, all these things that were happening in the 60s, the music, everything was changing
*  so radically and so drastically that the people in power had a very like an accurate sense
*  that they were losing control. And that change was inevitable. And they threw water on it. And
*  they did a great job. If you look at it from that perspective, the difference between me,
*  it's terrible what they did, but it was effective in that from 1970. A great job of throwing water
*  on it. Yeah, a great job of changing culture, which was changing in a potentially beneficial
*  way for everyone to get us to recognize that we truly are all one and that the way to make things
*  better for everyone is to make things better for the most disadvantaged. And this was the civil
*  rights movement, right? And this was the anti-war movement. This was recognizing that people are
*  being taken advantage by the military industrial complex and just sent overseas so that they could
*  profit. Amen. The first guy that I met that really like changed my perspective on the world,
*  especially in terms of what I could potentially do as a lawyer was Jerry Lefkort. Jerry Lefkort
*  was Abbie Hoffman's lawyer. He was the lead attorney in the Panther 21 trial.
*  I was like a kid. I was in my late 20s and I was met with him to help him pick a jury on a case.
*  And I had read about him before and he saw something in me. We hit it off. He became like my
*  surrogate uncle. And he would regale me with tales of the Panther 21 trial. And here's a guy that was
*  kind of winging it in his late 20s and can feel the change that you're talking about happening.
*  And he could feel the weight against him, the pushback coming from the other side,
*  where he would get death threats. He would get bomb threats at his office, where he could not
*  even see his client in jail approaching trial and had to get on a cherry picker outside the jail
*  to be able to get even with the window so that they could communicate. Jesus Christ. So Jerry
*  Lefkort, and he by the way got a full acquittal in the Panther 21 trial against all odds.
*  He was the first person that told me about Coin Intel Pro and what the lengths that the government
*  will go to when they feel like their message, their way of doing things is being challenged.
*  And I think that you hit the nail right on the head, which is this was like a
*  flew in the face of Leave It To Beaver. It flew in the face of, you know, Father Knows Best.
*  It flew in the face of what white America was trying to instill as a value system
*  that should be followed by all people without question for all time. And people started to say,
*  what the fuck is this about? I want to explore the messiness and the gray areas of what it means
*  to exist as a human being. And that expression, whether it was Richard Nixon, the people around
*  him that got their backs up. You know, so if you are a student of history and you start to understand
*  why we're here rather than just looking here and forward, I think these things for me are a little
*  bit easier to understand when somebody comes at me and calls me a race baiter for the work that I do
*  because I talk about the problem of race. I understand that that's born out of ignorance.
*  And I don't mean ignorance like you're a dummy. I mean ignorance like you're...
*  You don't have access to the information.
*  Yeah, or you chose not to have access to it.
*  Yeah, your perspective is incorrect.
*  Read Todd Neesey Coates' book Between the World and Me. It's a fascinating fucking tale. It's a
*  letter written from this black man to his 15-year-old son. And it's a life-altering
*  book for me because it puts you into his soul of what it has been like to grow up as a black man
*  in this country. And it stops me in my tracks when I think about it, when I talk about it,
*  because it's like the only way that we can get to a more common understanding is to, you know,
*  I think to read books like that and to talk to people. And if you're so closed off and
*  closed-minded... And again, I keep on sort of adding this disclaimer, and maybe this is my
*  aversion to getting attacked. I am not excusing if Sheldon did this. I just think that it's not so
*  simple as, oh, you let some guy... You help some guy get out and get re-sentenced and look what
*  he did and fuck all these people and fuck your movement. Okay, you're entitled to that opinion.
*  That's where I leave it.
*  Yeah, you can't listen to those people. You just... You know what you're doing. You're smart.
*  You can't listen. It's just that you're going to have those people. They're always going to exist.
*  There's always going to be people with limited information perspective, you know, and limited
*  information people sometimes are the loudest and the most vocal about it. And also the ones who
*  are least willing to objectively assess how they came to the conclusions that they're so vocal and
*  loud about. You know, limited information people. That's a big... I mean, that's why
*  clickbait headlines work. People love that shit.
*  That's why you get attacked sometimes by... You don't know about it because you don't read it.
*  That's why you get attacked sometimes.
*  Some people try to send it to me. It's funny. Hey, man, fuck off. Stop sending me that shit.
*  Someone in my family, a cousin of mine, sent me a link to a story
*  about you endorsing Trump and wrote, what the fuck? And I said, right, what the fuck? Why are you
*  sending this to me? Like, first of all, what the fuck? What the fuck are you... Because you
*  all of a sudden support this woman, who by the way, probably should have accepted the invitation
*  to come on the show. It might have been the difference between people getting to actually
*  know who the fuck she was. But putting that aside, it's like, I have to do a much better job of
*  filtering that stuff out because the notion that you are going to be influenced by outside forces
*  other than what you're doing, like for you to say, you know what you're doing. I like to think I
*  know what I'm doing. I feel like I'm doing good things. And I just got to keep on working in that
*  direction, not let what happens slow me down, try to learn from it and go forward. Look, I don't
*  want this to come across as like constantly being like a situation where I'm... Every time I get on
*  here, I thank you. But I think the importance of this forum was made clear by having the president
*  on, by having the vice president on, because it's the only open forum where you don't have to worry
*  about being judged, about someone chopping up what you say and twisting it or leaving some remarks
*  on the cutting room floor. And it's also important because you don't give a fuck about what other
*  people say or think and you just do what you feel is the right thing to do. Because I mean, I've told
*  you privately, I'll say it now again. It would have been the easy thing for you to do would have
*  been to say, well, fuck this guy. I'm turning my back. I don't need to have him on again.
*  So I said it was never going to happen. Well, listen, what you've done is amazing. And the people
*  that you have brought on this show have changed a lot of people's perspectives about our justice
*  system. A lot of people. You brought on some incredible people and you've told some incredible
*  stories. And as you said, people have been exonerated for crimes that they didn't commit.
*  If you are a person who's listening to this and you could be fucked by the system, it's possible.
*  You could be trapped by a corrupt prosecutor. It happens. Thank God it hasn't happened to you.
*  But if it did happen to you, you would pray that there's a Josh Dubin in the world that pays
*  attention to your case. I appreciate it. And I mean, it's not just me. There's a village of people.
*  But a person like you, and I think highlighting that and highlighting the need for that and
*  understanding of how the system can railroad you and the system can really fuck you over.
*  I think one of the things that we saw during the Trump campaign was the legal system being
*  used against one of the most powerful people in the world and how they can get away with turning
*  34 misdemeanors, essentially one misdemeanor, but 34 versions of it, 34 writing in a ledger
*  incorrectly, that's a misdemeanor and has passed the statute of limitations, can be converted into
*  a felony and turned against a guy who's running for president. As lawfare, it's just completely
*  using the legal system to try to attack a guy and try to take him out of the race and also try to
*  label him a convicted felon. So once you have this label, a convicted felon, you heard it on
*  all the talk shows, convicted felon, convicted felon. But enough people had a chance to look at
*  the circumstances of the case and understand what was actually what he was actually being tried for
*  paying someone off to not talk about how he fucked them. Is that what we're worried about?
*  Are we worried about World War Three? Is that what we're worried about? Are we worried about
*  terrorist cells being established in the United States because our borders wide open?
*  Are we worried about the price of groceries and people being able to feed themselves?
*  That's what we should be fucking worried about, not whether or not some guy fucks someone.
*  Like who cares? It's so interesting to me because the conversations that people in the legal
*  community in New York were having at the time, I cannot tell you how many times, it didn't matter
*  what side of the spectrum you were on politically. But in New York, there's a lot of fucking Democrats
*  and I can't tell you how often I got this call, what is the crime here? What I mean with regard
*  to that particular case, first of all, the D.A. of Manhattan seemed to realize that it was a futile
*  endeavor to go after this guy and retreated and then something happened and then you remember the
*  special prosecutors quit because they were furious apparently that the D.A. wouldn't go
*  forward with the case. Then something happens in between and Alvin Bragg, the district attorney of
*  Manhattan, proceeds with the case. So many legal scholars said what is the crime here?
*  I understand there's a series of misdemeanors that somehow gets flipped into a felony,
*  legal scholars that had issues with it and if they spoke about it publicly, they were attacked.
*  Alan Dershowitz was one of them, he was attacked. Anyone that would speak out and there's this fear
*  for good legal minds to get behind defending a case like that because it's viewed in
*  Democratic strongholds like kryptonite. So remarking on that case, yeah, it was weaponized
*  against him and that's why I think it was this morning the judge in that case agreed to a joint
*  motion by the prosecution and the defense to put everything on hold because they're deciding whether
*  or not they're going to dismiss that case and if you remember the drum that was constantly beat
*  before this election was he'll never get out of these state cases, the federal ones we understand
*  because he can pardon himself, but the state cases, oh those are going to be a problem. Well,
*  not so fast, right? Because now if it was that much of a crime and that people were so up in arms
*  about it, why are they now considering dismissing it? And I think that it puts the lie to the notion
*  that this was really something that we wanted to make an example out of and you can't engage in
*  this type of conduct. What conduct? You know, it was obviously politically motivated and you know
*  and it happens all over the country. It happens all over the country on both sides of the aisle,
*  though. We have, I have a case right now that and for me to be able to say this is probably,
*  you know, I had to think is this the craziest fucking case I've had? And it has to be.
*  It has to be because the DA that is sitting in judgment of whether or not these four men that
*  I'm going to tell you about in a moment right before the election for him to become DA gets
*  indicted. He gets indicted for allegedly like harassing a former employee and then trying to
*  bribe her not to file a complaint against him, something like that, right before the election.
*  And all of a sudden he is now embroiled in this. He loses the election a couple of weeks ago
*  and he is now finds himself wrongfully, according to him, wrongfully accused of a crime he didn't
*  commit. Well, my client is a guy by the name of John Edwards and there were four guys. This is in
*  Lorraine, Ohio, Lorraine County, Ohio. John Edwards, Lenworth Edwards, Benson Davis, and a guy named Al
*  Cleveland, New York guys in the early 90s who were selling drugs in Ohio. They were going back and
*  forth from Ohio to New York and one morning a man by the name of Epps is found dead in the street.
*  His roommate is found about seven hours later, a woman named Marsha Blakely dumped in an alley
*  behind a shopping center. The case is cold for a month. The police have hit dead ends. They have
*  nowhere to go with the case. The prosecutor's office offers a $2,000 reward for anyone with
*  information about the case. Wouldn't you know that the next day a man by the name of William
*  Avery Sr. walks in to the Lorraine County prosecutor's office. They sit him down with
*  the police and he says, I have information about the case. Now, this guy, William Avery Sr., was a
*  known informant. The police knew him. He had come and tried to give information about other cases,
*  didn't pan out. He was also a drug addict and they sit with him for over an hour and they say to him,
*  everything you're telling us has been in the papers, so you're not giving us anything new here.
*  He shows up the next day with his son, William Avery Jr. and he says he witnessed the murder.
*  So William Avery Jr. talks to the police. At the end of that interview, he goes, what about the
*  reward money? And the officer says, let's turn the tape recorder off and let's talk about that.
*  They tell him, we're not giving you the reward money because now you're telling us that
*  information that's been in the papers and all you're telling us is that you saw Marsha Blakely
*  assaulted in an apartment. You're not telling us anything about the murder.
*  The very next day, he shows up and says that Al Cleveland told him that he murdered Marsha Blakely.
*  So let's put a bookmark in it because I decided I wanted to do something a little bit different
*  today. At the end of the episode, I'm going to give you a Twitter account. I've submitted today
*  a 40-page submission. All of the exhibits that are mentioned in that submission
*  to the Lorraine County prosecutor. His name is J.D. Tomlinson.
*  So now I'm going to invite the public. Before you go writing a letter to him or calling him,
*  you read the submission and look at the exhibits yourself because what often happens
*  is that in these re-investigations, prosecutors' offices have something called a conviction
*  integrity unit where they say they'll re-investigate the case. They'll say, well,
*  I'm going to go to the conviction integrity unit where they say they'll re-investigate the case
*  and the very first thing they make you do is sign a no media agreement that you won't go to the media
*  because the last thing they want you to do is what I just did, is to talk about the case publicly.
*  So we're not in a conviction integrity unit. We're trying to appeal to a prosecutor,
*  J.D. Tomlinson, who from what I understand has told Al Cleveland's wife, because I've spoken
*  great woman, came up to her in the summer at a barbecue and said, when I was a law student,
*  I sat in on your husband's trial and it always bothered me and I want you to come in
*  and have your lawyers come in. I'm going to do the right thing.
*  And now that he's been indicted, he has gone silent. I haven't heard from him. I've text him.
*  I see he reads my messages because he has read receipts on and I guess he doesn't know that.
*  And I've asked him for his time. I think in his wildest dreams, he probably never
*  could have imagined that the case was going to now become national news.
*  He has between now and December 31st to do the right thing and exonerate them.
*  The incoming DA would never do it, I don't think, from what I've heard.
*  So I'm going to invite the public and I'll give you the link at the end and I want to tell you
*  the rest of the story because some of the things I tell you, you're going to say, come on,
*  that can't be true. So I have the exhibit sitting in a folder for everybody to read. But
*  I think that the justice system has been weaponized against JD Tomlinson because he was coming up for
*  a reelection. There's all sorts of personal animosity between him and the guy that just
*  got elected. There's allegations at least that the guy that just got elected was somehow involved in
*  getting him indicted by a special prosecutor. I don't know if it's true or not, but it doesn't
*  just happen on the big national stage. It happens all over the place and you just don't always hear
*  about it. Well, I think the fact that it happened on the big national stage the way it did and not
*  just the case of the hush money, but also the case of Mar-a-Lago being overvalued, which is
*  preposterous. That was one of the most ridiculous ones. They listed it at what, 17, 18 million dollars?
*  I would buy five of those if they were available for 18 million dollars. You know how much money
*  you would make for that kind of property? You ever been to this place? No. I've been there,
*  a bunch. I've seen it. It's magnificent. You walk in there and you feel like
*  Marjorie Post bought it and had it designed. It's magnificent. Forbes, I think, had valued it
*  between seven and nine hundred million dollars. Is that true? Find out what the valuation was.
*  But independently before all this shit, it had been valued and I think Trump valued it over a billion,
*  which of course he's going to do. And he's doing it to the bank, right? Trying to get a loan.
*  Paid the loan off with interest. Everything was fine. There's zero victims involved in this.
*  The fact that they want to say that it was actually, so what does it say here? Okay, 350.
*  The club had revenues of 25.1 million for the calendar year of 2017, 22 in 2018, and 21 in
*  2019. 2022, Forbes estimate the value of the estate around 350 million dollars. I think Trump
*  jacked it way higher than that. And I think I've read somewhere that someone had said between seven
*  and nine if you could like what a real estate evaluation would be, like what it's actually
*  worth in the state that it's at. I think there was an issue though that it was a wasn't it like
*  listed as a national historic landmark or something like that, Jamie? Right. So then you really can't
*  do anything to it, which devalues it somewhat, but still. I would think, listen, 18 million is
*  fucking crazy. There's no property like that anywhere. You feel like you're in Europe when
*  you're there. It is a magnificent place and has some of the best food in Florida.
*  So I don't, and I don't know, part of the valuation of something like that seems to me to be a bit
*  subjective. It's now the home of the sitting two-time president of the United States.
*  So yeah, but putting all that aside. Just the real estate alone. There was a lot that was sold
*  next to it or a home that was sold next to it. There was 50 million dollars. And it's not just
*  Mar-a-Lago. Across the street they have the beach club that sits right on the beach. But the point
*  is that they're meddling into, look, the bank could have said, well, we're going to send an
*  appraiser out there and we're going to determine whether or not we agree with you that it's worth
*  that. That happens for anyone that's ever sold a home. So yeah. The point is there's no victim.
*  The point is it's not like he got this loan and then defrauded the bank and then defaulted on his
*  loan and then pocketed the money. No, no. He paid everything back with interest. It was profitable
*  for the bank. Everything worked out. It's like this is a bullshit case. Everyone knows it's a
*  bullshit case. So that's another one that was in the news that everybody got a chance to see.
*  Well, hopefully it opens people's eyes. Look, there's a lot of white collar crimes that I've been
*  a defense lawyer on where you see the human cost of a prosecution, what it does to the person
*  accused, but also their family. And to somehow crawl out from under the weight of the federal
*  government, these take years and a fortune to defend. And oftentimes you're thinking,
*  why did they bring this case? Who are the victims here? And they come up with some
*  loss calculation that's very theoretical. I'm talking about cases where you can't point to a
*  victim that lost money. And you wonder why some prosecutions are brought and others aren't.
*  And you see again what it does to not only devastate families and the accused, but is it
*  really deterring anyone? I would never ever enter an industry where I was working with stocks, bonds,
*  commodities, anything that was regulated in any way by FINRA, the SEC, because it seems like they
*  can make a case sometimes when there isn't a case to be made. And hopefully, regardless of what's on
*  the political spectrum you're on, what happened to Trump should be eye-opening to people because
*  you don't have to agree with him or his politics or his policies to see what's happening today as
*  we sit here when everything's being reconsidered and you think about the massive expense that
*  it takes to prosecute these cases. That guy has, I don't care what anybody says about him,
*  he's got to be one of the toughest motherfuckers you've ever met to stare down all of this.
*  And most people would be in a puddle to stare down these prosecutions and the threat of going to jail
*  and everything else, that breaks a lot of people. And then two assassination attempts. Jesus Christ.
*  He's built different. Yeah, he has. The guy's 78 years old and I talked to him for three hours and
*  he didn't pee before, he didn't pee afterwards, just sat here, talked, didn't lose any energy,
*  and then flew off to do a campaign rally. Yeah, listen, I wish him all the success in the world.
*  I hope he does well. I got these, well you can't vote for Kamala Harris after what you've said
*  about her, you're right. I voted for Jill Stein because this two-party system to me is fucked.
*  You know, you got to be with us or them and then there's all kinds of gaslighting that goes on.
*  Yeah. You have to answer to people. I just feel like there should be more choices but that's a
*  different... Well, there certainly should be. That's a different existential issue.
*  You spoke on the podcast about her history as a prosecutor and what she had done
*  and I know they contacted you after that. Yeah, I mean what was happening, well this was way back
*  when, I think it was days before she was selected to be the vice presidential running mate for Biden
*  but I think it was Carpenter who was, is that his name? He's a great congressman.
*  He wears an eye patch. I don't know. Oh, Dan Crenshaw? Dan Crenshaw, not Carpenter.
*  Dan Crenshaw took a clip from the podcast and was circulating it on Twitter and it was of me being
*  critical of her and you know, and again that's a situation where she had so many opportunities
*  during this campaign to just say, listen, I obviously, I watched a little vignette about
*  this family who was prosecuted for their truant child and it ruined them. So all of this,
*  I'm a prosecutor and I'm going to prosecute the case against this, that petrified me
*  because I have sat in rooms with prosecutors that just want to be right and win and I would just say,
*  please, just open your mind a little bit. I was just, I just sat in a room with a conviction
*  integrity unit and there were prosecutors in the room where, and I can't, I signed one of those
*  agreements so I can't name the case or the city or the borough, but where the prosecutor went to
*  federal prison for bribing witnesses and is accused of the same conduct in this case where he was
*  giving money to someone who was recanted their testimony and the prosecutor sitting in the room
*  were like, it wasn't that they weren't open-minded. They had their mind made up before we got in there
*  and you feel like saying, can you just listen? Just listen. They just want to win. Yeah, and I
*  think that that is my problem with the two-party system is that it's you're either on this side
*  or you're on this side and there's no room for gray area between the issues. I have a friend
*  who, I mean, I learned so much during this election. I have a friend who is from Central America
*  and she was telling me, I didn't, when Trump won the first time, I was furious. I couldn't stand the
*  guy, but when I came to this country, I saw my mom fight for citizenship and I saw what she had to
*  go through the right way for me to get citizenship and she said, so I just can't vote for anybody but
*  him. So everybody has their own reasons for doing it. It doesn't mean it has to be all about a
*  cult of personality and you're voting for, you're endorsing everything about the person and I think
*  that having that understanding that, look, a lot of people that I spoke to a friend of mine the
*  other day that grandparents were in the Holocaust. His grandfather survived the Holocaust and he
*  voted for Trump because he's like, I didn't feel protected by the other side as the grandson of
*  people that went through that. So yeah, I just think that watching a system get weaponized
*  against someone in that way, it's upsetting and hopefully, like you said, it opens people's eyes
*  to the fact that if they could do it to the president, it could happen to you. And it's so
*  transparent. It was so transparent. It wasn't like he committed a murder and there's a lot of evidence
*  pointing to the fact that he committed this murder. No, it was just a crime that didn't make any sense.
*  You're going to spend millions and millions of dollars prosecuting this crime. You're going to
*  parade it around for the whole world just so the Democrats can have this talking point, convicted
*  felon. And you just see it repeated over and over again on MSNBC and CNN. These pundits want to say,
*  convicted felon. They want to say that. Like, what's the fucking crime? Tell me what the crime is.
*  But when you want to get smart and spout off facts, why don't you tell me about the case?
*  Because I've looked at it and it's fucking bananas. And if it happened to you, you'd be terrified
*  because they just made a crime. They made a felony out of something that's not a felony.
*  I mean, listen, the, um,
*  if you're looking for logic and reasoning in any of these, you're not going to find it. I mean,
*  listen, I feel terrible, but I feel different about some of the cases. Like I feel like the
*  you know, the election case is, has the most substance to it. You know, standing up and saying
*  the elections rigged, the elections rigged. I have a problem with that, but you know, obviously
*  more than half the country didn't have as much of a problem with it. And that was one of the ones
*  that I said was the weirdest where he didn't have an answer ready. That you should have an answer
*  ready right away. If I had been accused of something like that, and I strongly believed
*  the elections were rigged, I'd be able to give you facts right away. But he can't.
*  Well, who's his facts? Rudy Giuliani and my pillow? Well, that's the thing is like, I don't know
*  how much time he has to investigate the cases, right? So he has probably people telling him
*  things and who are these people and what is their evidence? What's their information? I would,
*  I would hope that if you have something that's so controversial, like you ran for president,
*  you believe you should have won and they rigged it, you should have data that you could spit out
*  any cocktail party. But he's doing the same thing that you're talking about CNN and MSNBC do, which
*  is just repeating the same thing. When people were standing in line voting a couple of weeks ago,
*  he was saying the election was, this election was rigged and poof, it must have straightened it out
*  because he won. But I don't, you know. What he was saying was they were trying to rig the election.
*  And I think- What facts did he have to back that up?
*  Well, there's the one thing of bringing in people to the country illegally and then pushing for
*  amnesty, which was they were doing. They were doing.
*  Yeah, I just don't know the numbers on it. I don't know if there's-
*  Well, it's millions of people. If you think about the amount of people that came into the country,
*  right? And you think about how some of these swing states, the cumulative votes was like 75,000 that
*  switched it one way or another. And just, you could imagine if you're bringing in millions and
*  millions of people and you're moving them to swing states.
*  Well, if that's true.
*  And the evidence against it was like, well, they're not all moving to swing states. Well,
*  okay, you can't tell people where they can and can't move once they come to the United States.
*  If they have family that's in Texas or if they have family that's in Arkansas or whatever,
*  they're going to go over the fuck they want to go. But a significant number of them were in the
*  country. If you're bringing in 10 million people, you have quite a bit of a buffer. It's not a
*  perfect system. But if you're trying to let people in illegally and then give them not just
*  protection, but also money, food, food stamps, housing, taking care of them, and then giving
*  them an incentive to vote for the party that did that to them when the other party wants to,
*  they want to round people up and mass deportations.
*  Yeah, but putting party aside, what evidence did you see, documentary evidence that people were
*  registering to vote and how many of them? Well, it's not that they were registering to vote.
*  The issue is that there's no voter ID, which is fucking insane. You need an ID for everything.
*  This ID that poor people- Where is there no voter ID?
*  Harris won some states that require voter ID, contrary to online claims, fact check. So,
*  there's an online chart that's incorrect that people are passing around.
*  See, this is exactly- So what states did she win that have voter ID?
*  There's certain deep blue states. I hear you.
*  Colorado and Rhode Island are two. But look what just happened.
*  So is that two? Is that the two? Vice President also won New Hampshire, which requires voter ID,
*  but allows individuals without one to either have their identity confirmed by a designated official
*  or fill out an affidavit. Harris also won both Delaware and Virginia. So there's a couple states
*  that she won that have voter ID. But these are like these deep blue states.
*  Fair enough. Look, I don't know- I think the question is the swing states.
*  I don't know enough about it. And I live in a world where I need the evidence. But backing up
*  to the other election, look, I'm just saying if there was one case where I was like, come on, man.
*  You know what's weird about the one, the 2020 that we keep going back to,
*  is the amount of people that voted. That's what's really crazy.
*  Way more. Way more.
*  Way more. Way more.
*  I don't know what to make of that.
*  Well, it's the first time ever you have mail-in ballots that are used ubiquitously.
*  That wasn't a thing before. Mail-in ballots were essentially for people that were overseas.
*  Well, I think COVID had a big part in roleplaying that.
*  Sure, it did. But also never miss an opportunity. And if you wanted to cheat,
*  that would be the way to do it. And to try to keep voting by mail-in ballots when it's not
*  necessary anymore. It's not a pandemic. Sounds good.
*  Seems crazy. It does. But it's not- to me,
*  I live in a world where you cannot say shit like that without backing it up. But listen, whether-
*  I don't- I have started to really veer away from having a strong political view and just
*  putting my head down and doing what I can. So I don't- I mean, I don't see the evidence
*  on the prior election. I see the claim repeated a lot. I just didn't see the-
*  I don't see the evidence either. But I do see evidence that people are trying to make it easier
*  for illegals to vote. That disturbs me. The pathway to citizenship has always been
*  kind of difficult. And when you talk to people that have done it the right way, it's very hard.
*  They have to go up for review. They have to hope that this person decides that they're a person
*  worthy of being in this country. And you had to be a person of extraordinary skill and talent,
*  where that talent and skill wasn't available in the United States.
*  Listen, I recently moved out of New York to Florida. And I got my driver's license and
*  registered to vote pretty quick after I moved there. My wife didn't. When we went to vote,
*  they wouldn't let her vote because it hadn't been 30 days yet. So all I could say is that in Florida,
*  they required an ID. And they didn't let my wife-
*  Well, California literally passed a law where you're not allowed to ask for ID,
*  which is crazy.
*  Yeah, it is crazy.
*  That's crazy. Well, why would you do that? What would be the most charitable version of why you
*  would do that?
*  Yeah. Andre Ward and I have been discussing California quite a bit recently. And it seems like
*  it's a little bananas to live in California right now.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  It's not going to get better either. A lot more people voted red in California. Have you seen the
*  map of 2020 versus 2024?
*  Yeah, I did.
*  It's a giant significant shift. And if that keeps going, the state's going to go red.
*  And I think if the state keeps falling apart, people are going to come to their senses and
*  recognize that the policies that they have in place right now are fucking gross. They're gross.
*  And you've got a bunch of bureaucrats that are profiting off of the homeless situation.
*  They're taxing the fucking shit out of people. The state tax is 14. If you live in LA,
*  it's another one. 15% of all your money just goes to incompetence.
*  It's the same thing in New York City. I mean, you're giving to the state, to the city.
*  You end up paying way more than if you make enough money, you end up paying way more.
*  Here's the rub I don't get about Democrats.
*  All right. This is the thing that bothers me about Democrats. And this is why I registered
*  finally as an independent. We hear about the American dream a lot. The American dream.
*  The American dream. I was the son of a teacher. Now I sound like a politician. I was the son of
*  a teacher in a sales.
*  Did you grow up middle class?
*  What's that? Yeah, I grew up middle class.
*  That's the thing that Kamala Harris always says.
*  Mid middle class. And we had to grind it out and there were financial problems and everything
*  else. So the American dream is to make it on your own, to be self-made. And then you get to that
*  point and you get demonized for it. Now you need to give back in a way that how dare you not give
*  more than half your effective salary, more than half your income. If you live in California or
*  New York, you give it away. 52%, 53%. You end up feeling like, what the fuck? What did I do wrong?
*  I give back in so many other ways.
*  My take on that. If they were doing a great job and they were legitimately making people's lives
*  better, I'd be fine with that. If there was a system where I had to pay 50% because I make a
*  lot of money and I had to pay 50%, but that 50% was changing people's lives, they could show you
*  all these success stories. It's like revolutionizing the way poor people are allowed to make it out of
*  that situation.
*  You didn't feel that in California?
*  I wasn't feeling it in New York.
*  Nobody feels it.
*  Going to the state courthouse.
*  You feel bureaucracy. You feel like corrupt politicians who are profiting off of narratives
*  and they're a bunch of dirty people who don't even follow their own fucking rules,
*  particularly Gavin Newsom. Doesn't even follow his own rules. It's the guy that got busted in
*  the middle of the pandemic wearing no mask indoors, eating at the French laundry. It's all bullshit.
*  It's all bullshit and the people felt really fucking imprisoned by it. They felt really
*  captured by their government and that's why a lot of people move.
*  He's got great hair.
*  He does have great hair. He's a great sort of version of what you would expect of a politician.
*  Why does great hair get you so far?
*  People want great hair. They want good genes. Tall and great hair means a lot to people.
*  We're stupid. People are stupid. There's a lot of stupidity involved in why we choose things.
*  I read this article once about how there was a poll done of female voters when Bill Clinton
*  ran the first time and they asked the reasons why and it was multiple choice and one of them
*  was that he was good looking and had a full head of hair.
*  They want to fuck him.
*  Apparently he wanted to fuck them.
*  He's a great president though. In terms of policy, in terms of what differed the economy,
*  Guy was a great president, great orator.
*  I agree except for the fact that mass incarceration kind of started with him.
*  Yes, the crime bill of 94.
*  So I think that our prison industrial complex started with Bill Clinton.
*  Well it was kicked off by Joe Biden.
*  It did. It was just hilarious. This is the guy running against all that.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  It was very interesting to me that this is playing out in real time with the incoming president and I
*  have this parallel situation going on in Ohio. This is called a weave. I'm weaving back to Ohio
*  and I want to tell you the rest of the story about the Ohio Four.
*  So this guy, J.D. Tomlinson, is the prosecuting attorney in Lorraine. He's under indictment right
*  now. He's got two months left. Like I said, he now knows, according to him, what it's like to be
*  wrongfully accused of a crime. So watch this. You have these four guys who, again it's Al Cleveland,
*  Lenworth Edwards, John Edwards, Benson Davis. Yeah, you got to light up for this one.
*  So I told you, William Avery Sr. goes in, tries to get the reward money. They tell him,
*  fuck off, brings his son in the next day. They say to him, no dice. Then he comes back and says,
*  okay, Al Cleveland told me he committed the murder.
*  So the guy is a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy.
*  Comes time for their trials to begin and they're going to all be tried separately.
*  And William Avery Jr. gives this account of how this murder happened. And he says that he
*  watches this woman, Marshall Blakely, get beat for 15 to 20 minutes inside of her apartment
*  and that the reason this woman gets beat is because Al Cleveland wanted him to work off
*  a debt and beat her up. And he said no. So then these four men bust in the door and
*  this is how the crime occurs. It comes time for the first trial of these four men.
*  And William Avery Jr. shows up as the prosecution star witness and he says,
*  I want $10,000 to testify. He gave me two, I want 10,000. And the prosecutor say,
*  we're not giving it to you. And he says, then I'm not testifying. The judge throws him in jail.
*  He's in jail. He is cool in his heels, as they say. And he says, you know,
*  I made this whole thing up and I did it for the money. And no one believes him. And the judge
*  says, what are you talking about? You're going to get on the stand and testify. He says, no, I'm not.
*  And now he's facing potential perjury charges. The judge declares a mistrial. He then comes back
*  with a new story to the prosecutors and says he witnessed the beating, he witnessed other details
*  of the crime. He then goes on to testify at all four of their trials. After the first mistrial,
*  they all get convicted. He then fully recants of his own volition, says he got off drugs,
*  says he wants to straighten out his life. He's in the process of cooperating with the FBI and the
*  Secret Service. Now these exhibits are sitting in this folder. You go to Twitter, it's Free the Ohio
*  4. Free the Ohio 4. There it is. And if you just click on that URL, there was a reason because I
*  didn't put it up until right before the episode today. I'm going to get on right now and be the
*  first person to follow it. If you click on that, it will bring you to a folder with this 40 page
*  submission that I put in today and references to all of the exhibits. So here, this is my first page.
*  At the trials of Al Monday, that was his pseudonym, Al Cleveland's pseudonym,
*  at the trials of Al Monday and those charged with him, I testified under oath that I was an
*  eyewitness to Alfred Cleveland, who I knew as Monday, along with other people I knew
*  as JR Will and Shaquem, who was John Edwards, beat Marsha Blakely at Floyd Epps' apartment
*  and then murdered her behind Charlie's Bar in Lorraine. All of this was a lie. I never witnessed
*  the murder of Marsha Blakely, was not with her or Al Cleveland the night she was murdered. I only
*  done it for the money and everything was not true. The entire case was built on this man. There's no
*  forensic evidence, no eyewitnesses, nothing. So this is not to be believed.
*  What was the reason why they thought this woman and that other man were murdered?
*  They didn't know. They had no theory. Police had no connection to them.
*  No connection to them. There was no theory like drug deal gone wrong.
*  That was what they ended up coming up with was that she was a drug user,
*  Cleveland was a drug dealer. It must have been drugs gone wrong. So something involving drugs
*  gone wrong. So William Avery Jr. is after they get convicted is working as an informant for the FBI
*  and the Secret Service. Now, prior to this case, maybe this is how obtuse I am. I thought that the
*  Secret Service's purview was the president, but apparently they have other investigative functions
*  because he was working on some food stamp scheme as an informant. The Secret Service tells the FBI
*  and the testimony is in that exhibit file. The Secret Service tells the FBI, this guy,
*  William Avery Jr., he's not to be trusted. He's lying to us and he's lying to us for money.
*  They contact the prosecutor. The FBI calls the prosecutor in Lorraine County and says,
*  this guy, William Avery Jr., used him as an informant in that case against these four men.
*  He's a liar and he does this for money. So they end up getting Al Cleveland's lawyers,
*  John Edwards' lawyers, Linworth Edwards, Benson Davis, they end up getting an evidentiary hearing
*  and William Avery Jr. comes to testify and he's coming to testify that I made the whole thing up
*  and he's in very exquisite detail. His father, who obviously brought him there, threatened his life.
*  He sat him down and smoked crack with him to calm him down.
*  He can't make this shit up. Wait till you read the affidavit. He sat him down and smoked crack
*  with him to calm him down and told him, I need that reward money for my drug habit. He was a
*  fucking junkie. So he needs the reward money and he gets his son to go in there and it's obvious
*  if you watch the, if you read the interrogation and his testimony that he's being led, they show
*  him pictures of the apartment where this woman was allegedly beat. He's getting details wrong.
*  He changed his story. He was telling conflicting versions of the story. So at these post-conviction
*  hearings where these men should have all been exonerated, he gets on the stand and before he
*  testifies, the judge says to him, have you been advised? Do you have an attorney? He said, I don't
*  think I need an attorney. And he tells William Avery Jr. Well, you need an attorney. We're going
*  to appoint you an attorney because you're about to perjure yourself because you either did one of
*  two things. You either lied and that put four men in prison or you're about to lie now to set them
*  free. Either way, you've lied under oath. Think about the mind fuck of this. So this guy is coming
*  to clear his conscience and the judge threatens him with prosecution. So he gets an appointed
*  attorney and they go and ask the prosecutor, will you give him immunity so he can tell the truth?
*  They say no. His defense attorney asks the judge, will you give him immunity so he can tell the
*  truth? And the judge says no. Oh God. And they tell him, we're going to charge you with perjury
*  if you tell the truth. He walks out of the courthouse, okay, after pleading the fifth
*  and is interviewed by the local paper walking out of the courthouse. That's in the exhibits.
*  And he says, they're all innocent. I made the whole thing up. I've been trying to tell the truth here,
*  but I can't go to jail for whatever time they're going to give me. So here you have a guy that is
*  the son of a known junkie. He has been, the prosecutors in this, in Lorain County have told,
*  have been told by the FBI that he's not reliable, that he makes things up just to get money.
*  He's been caught in lie after lie after lie and now he comes and wants to tell the truth
*  and set these men free. And the crazy, and this judge puts him in this situation where
*  he's, he can't tell the truth or else he's going to get prosecuted. This is what happens in this
*  country. This is the kind of thing that these four men, two of them are out, two of them are serving
*  life sentences. Al Cleveland's wife Roberta Cleveland saw this DA and he said he was going
*  to do the right thing. He knew that the case was problematic and now because he's worried about his
*  own indictment, you know, he's not responding. So what we're asking for is your listeners
*  to go through and read this very detailed submission that I've made along with the
*  Ohio Innocence Project, the Ohio Public Defenders, and a great attorney by the name of Kim Corral,
*  who you actually had a good laugh over one time, oddly enough, because she was at the White House
*  when Kanye West was there. She was apparently standing over him smiling and you were like,
*  look at this fucking girl. She just thinks that like, how the fuck did I get here? She told me
*  about it this morning. Did she feel that way? Like how the fuck did I get here? She probably did.
*  She's super cool. I spoke to her this morning. She's a badass and she was like, I've never met
*  him but he seems awesome. And he did have a good laugh at my expense when Kanye was in the White House.
*  That's her. Do you remember this? Kind of. It's so funny. But she's Kanye in the White House. I forgot
*  that. She's awesome. But so we're asking your listeners to go and read the exhibits,
*  read the submission, and then I have a contact page. Call JD Tomlinson. Write him a letter.
*  Look, these four men, thank you, Jamie, these four men certainly were drug dealers. Al Cleveland,
*  we've established Al Cleveland's alibi, John Edwards' alibi. Check this shit out.
*  His alibi witness was Damon John from Shark Tank. He testified in his fucking trial at post-conviction
*  hearings. Damon John back then was a hard scrabble New Yorker. He was doing whatever he could to
*  grind it out. This is before FUBU. And he was friends with Al Cleveland and Al needed to have
*  a TV moved. And Damon had like a gypsy cab service, a car service in New York. You lived in New York,
*  right? You remember what it was like. You call a cab service, a car service. And he was with
*  Al Cleveland the day of these murders. Al Cleveland saw his probation officer the day after the
*  murders. People saw him all over New York when the murders happened. John Edwards was with his
*  girlfriend, his girlfriend's family throughout the night from like 10 at night till 3 in the morning.
*  His girlfriend was pissed off at him because he was flirting with some girl in the bar.
*  So these guys have alibis. There is no question. They had absolutely nothing to do with this crime.
*  This woman, Marsha Blakely, was murdered, right? Here's one of the strangest facts in this case.
*  She is seen all over town, all over town at the time they claim that this guy,
*  William Avery, originally claimed she was murdered. She's seen by family members, friends. She's
*  looking for a crack. She's walking down the street way after this guy claims it happened.
*  How was she murdered?
*  She was, throat was cut and she was run over by a car. All right, so we've talked about tunnel
*  vision before and when the police think they have the guy, they had a problem on their hands. They
*  couldn't solve the crime and they have these guys that are drug dealers in the area. So they become
*  easy marks for this. There is a blade sitting in a diagram found right next to Marsha Blakely's body.
*  They never tested it. They never collected it. They never tested it. It was at a time when DNA,
*  it's the early 90s, DNA was around. Her roommate, Epps, Raymond Epps, is found a mile or two down
*  the road with his throat slit and run over. Same thing. Same thing. No one's been charged.
*  No one's been charged. It's an unsolved case as of this day. Why? Because they pinned it on these
*  other guys. Because they pinned it on these guys and this guy, William Avery Jr., only came in with
*  information about one of the murders. The cases were so clearly connected that the medical examiner
*  pointed it out. These people were killed in the same way. Why there isn't an outrage, a fucking
*  outrage about this case is beyond me. When I got this case, I said, there is no way what you're
*  telling me is true. That this guy has come and wants to clear his conscience and tells you exactly
*  what happened and the FBI told the prosecutors that he's a liar. And these guys are still,
*  two of them are still serving life sentences. And when you have to live stamped as a murderer,
*  even in the free world, you know, Al Cleveland is out and he's suffering.
*  I mean, I had to listen to his wife, heaving. She couldn't get a hold of herself because she
*  went down to J.D. Tomlinson's office and said, you told me you were going to help.
*  You were going to help. And he said, I can't now. I'm sorry, I've been indicted.
*  The last time I exonerated someone, look what they did to me because he exonerated someone else and
*  his political opponents attacked him. You know, human beings, we sometimes get in our own way
*  because of outside forces. What we think other people are going to say, think J.D. Tomlinson's
*  been voted out. He's been wrongfully accused of a crime. It's time for him to say, you know what,
*  I'm going to do the right thing. All I ask is actually a meeting with him. I want to meet with
*  you between now and December 31st. Let me lay everything out for you as I have in this submission.
*  He's now going to have it in his hands. He wouldn't answer my text messages. I'll give him a break.
*  He was obviously going through some serious personal issues, being under indictment, running
*  for reelection. This is an easy thing. This is just doing the right thing. There is no way that
*  you could look at this evidence. This is why I think it's a good idea for, rather than give
*  a snapshot of a case and have to rely on some process with these conviction integrity units
*  behind closed doors where they run the reinvestigation. I like the public being able
*  to get invested and look at the evidence themselves. Everyone loves a true crime story.
*  So why not, as part of this, let the public help make the case. When they write a letter,
*  they'll do it more forcefully. Or they call him and say, how could you ignore this?
*  So I would just encourage everyone to go on Twitter and go to Free The Ohio 4 and look at
*  the evidence. If you ever, I've gotten so many reach outs, how can I make a difference? What can
*  I do to make a difference? This is it. You can write, you can call. His cell phone number is
*  online because he was running for reelection. Let him know that the public is watching
*  and expecting him to do the right thing. That's the best use I feel like I can make of public
*  advocating for change is to help bring in the public and give them a vested interest in trying
*  to help. Well, this case is, this is just an amazing example. Right? I mean, you said this
*  is the craziest case you think you've ever had. I don't think I've ever had a case ever where
*  a case ever where the sole alleged eyewitness recants and then is threatened with jail time
*  is actually put in jail after trying to extort the prosecutors where there's no forensic evidence.
*  And it was the most incomplete investigation I have ever seen. What would be the most logical
*  thing to do if this guy says, you know what, there was a beating at this house?
*  What would be the most logical thing for police to do? There was a beating inside this apartment
*  for 15 to 20 minutes and this woman was brutally beaten. What are the police going to do first?
*  Scan for evidence. Go to the apartment. They go to the apartment. Right. They don't spray it for
*  luminol. They don't see if there's use. Luminol is a chemical agent that brings out hidden blood.
*  You know, they do nothing. They go and do a scan of the apartment, a visual scan and see nothing
*  out of order. They don't test that knife. And this is was there evidence that the woman was beaten?
*  No evidence. Oh, there was evidence that she was beaten, just not in that apartment.
*  So she was beaten before she was stabbed? There was an eyewitness that saw her that night with
*  like a black eye begging for money for drugs after he allegedly saw her killed. So she was living
*  a street life and there was suspicion that she was trading sex for money so that she could feed her
*  drug habit. So I just don't, I've never had a case where the FBI calls the prosecutor and says,
*  this guy is a liar and he goes in for reward money and for financial gain and he can't be trusted.
*  Never had a case where a judge says, if you tell the truth,
*  we're going to put you in jail. If you tell the truth, it's just as bad as putting these guys,
*  you know, you either told a lie to put them in jail or you're now telling a lie to free them.
*  I mean, I just don't get it. I just don't get it. I don't understand why, you know, in almost half
*  of the cases where there has been an exoneration based on a sole eyewitness's testimony, over half
*  the people recant and the courts are very critical of these recantations. So in other words,
*  if someone makes up a story and then they come back and say, look, I made that up because my dad
*  was threatening me and because the police threatened me, that's somehow viewed very,
*  very critically. Whereas the initial allegation, it's really easy to put someone in jail, real easy,
*  real difficult to get them out. So do you think that's because the system is set up to not reverse
*  convictions because it's bad for the prosecutor's record, it's bad for the confidence of the judicial
*  system? Like all of the above. Yeah. I mean, why did Kamala Harris block, why did she block access
*  to biological evidence from crime scenes? I think the rationale back then was, oh, well,
*  it would lead to a flood of requests. So fucking what? Right. A lot of requests from innocent
*  people, perhaps. Or people that want, you know, maybe they're guilty and they want to take a shot,
*  who knows? But isn't that worth the price of, you know, wrongfully incarcerating people? And,
*  you know, why is, there's so much politics that gets wound up in this. I don't, you know,
*  and for the life of me, I don't understand why, you know, it doesn't see the light of day more.
*  I testified before the House Judiciary Committee in Florida in connection with the Perlmutter case
*  when their DNA was stolen. All right. Their DNA was stolen and they were wrongfully accused of a
*  crime, like in Lori Perlmutter. And I testified before the House Judiciary Committee that
*  stealing someone's DNA as a private citizen should be a felony. All right. It was a misdemeanor.
*  And, you know, it was one of my finer moments of oration, I think, because I got a 16-0 vote.
*  And I had a really interesting discussion. It's recorded. I should find it and send it to you
*  sometime. But there were Republicans that asked me, hey, what is it that we can do to help you more?
*  Because this story is crazy. And I said, well, there is something that you can do as part of
*  this bill. We would like to make it not only a felony, but give defense attorneys that have a
*  good faith basis to believe that it's an alternative suspect's DNA, the same right to collect that DNA
*  as law enforcement. And if they make a showing to the court that they have a basis to believe that
*  this is an alternative suspect. So I had a former police officer who was a member of the Judiciary
*  Committee say, look, I was a cop, and we used to do it all the time. And his exact quote was,
*  what's good for the goose is good for the gander. And I think if you can make a good face showing,
*  I want to support that. When it came time for the bill to go to the Senate, the guy that was
*  sponsoring the bill wasn't responding to me. I said, we got overwhelming support, not only to
*  get the bill made from a misdemeanor into a felony, but also to allow defense attorneys,
*  criminal defense attorneys with an adequate showing to collect the DNA of alternative suspects.
*  And I said, so we'd like to add that amendment. And he just stopped responding to me. And finally
*  I got him on the phone and I said, what's the story? Why aren't you responding to this? And he goes,
*  it's not happening, Josh, it's just not going to happen. And I said, why? He goes, I'm not
*  going to go into that, but it's not happening. So, you know, obviously there was some political
*  pushback to it. He just wasn't going to have that part of this bill. So, you know, I don't know
*  what else you can do to push these issues, you know, other than get out there in the public
*  and bang the drum about it and try to get people to pay attention. And this I think is a rare
*  opportunity because it gives people, it allows them to invest in this. It allows them to see
*  what the evidence is and actually, you know, write a letter and say, hey, I saw the testimony of this
*  Secret Service agent, of this FBI agent under oath in these post-conviction proceedings. Why can't,
*  what more would you need? You have the power to exonerate these guys and end this 30-year-long
*  nightmare for them. Why not do it? Yeah, why not? Well, I'm hoping that this is one of those cases
*  where the people get activated and the way you laid it out is so crazy. I mean,
*  and with more evidence online that people have access to, I'm sure there's a bunch of people
*  who are going to react to that. I'm curious to see what the response is going to be.
*  Yeah, Free The Ohio 4, at Free The Ohio 4 on Twitter. And you know, like I'm not a big
*  Twitter guy, or I can't say Twitter anymore. I'm not a big ex guy. Yeah. So I mean, I guess I
*  should get more into it. Yeah, we did. We threw this up. Hopefully that the numbers start going
*  up. Oh, they will. As soon as it gets published, I'm sure we'll get a chance to see. It's going to
*  be interesting to see how many bots lock onto it. Yeah. And then it would be my dream to one day
*  have the Ohio 4 sitting here and have a toast. Yeah. Wow. What a story they have, huh? Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ. And you know, the sad part about it is, is like, I hope that people don't say,
*  well, they were drug dealers at the time. And, you know, again, that's not because you commit
*  one crime doesn't mean that. Yeah, doesn't mean you're murder. Also, like, it's the circumstances
*  are different for every fucking human being. And for you to think that there's no way that I would
*  do a crime, especially a crime like that. Like, are you sure? Are you sure if you were in their
*  shoes? If you live their life? You know, we all like to think that everybody's life is the same
*  as ours. We only have one life that we can kind of reference when we look at other people's lives,
*  we kind of imagine what it would be like to live their life. We don't know. People do desperate
*  things in desperate times, depending upon your environment, depending upon how you grew up,
*  what your influences were, what trauma you experienced, whether you were incarcerated at
*  a young age. No one has any understanding of that other than the people that get trapped into the
*  system. They just don't. You know, it's tough on crime. Yes, I think you should be tough on crime.
*  I think you should arrest criminals and evil people that do terrible things and make society awful.
*  Yeah, so do I.
*  But also, you should definitely not arrest innocent people. You should definitely not imprison them
*  and then punish someone who's trying to say, hey, the reason why these people are in jail is because
*  I told a lie.
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't get the threat of punishing them. And you know, you,
*  I hope you have the type of influence and following that just listen to that perspective,
*  folks, right? You know, I have in the last few years developed a way deeper understanding of
*  how relative trauma can be from individual to individual. I did not realize trauma that I had
*  suffered until I started to travel those roads. And then how it can impact behavior.
*  So I'm trying to make better decisions about how I judge things because I don't want to say I don't
*  make, I'm not judgmental. We're all judgmental.
*  Everyone's judgmental.
*  You have to be. That's how you survive in life.
*  Right. I have to form judgments, but I'm trying to make more educated judgments rather than
*  judging someone based on, you know, not having a complete picture of what they might have been
*  through and also not being able to put myself as best I can behind their eyeballs or in their brain.
*  It's hard unless you really make an investment. And I think the easy thing to do
*  is to make a quick judgment and keep it moving.
*  Yes.
*  Right. And I think that words can be an excuse. The deep dive is too much of a time investment,
*  too difficult. And I've had to understand behaviors that I never thought I would ever
*  have to consider. And I can tell you, at least in my experience, it forces you to become a more
*  compassionate human being, a more understanding human being. You get to know yourself better.
*  Because if you're not just constantly trying to figure out more about yourself and others,
*  what the fuck are we doing here?
*  Right. What the fuck are we doing here? Yeah. Yeah. If you're not trying to figure out more
*  about yourself, I mean, if you're the most enlightened person alive, tell us how you did it.
*  You know, you don't have any searching to do anymore. Tell us what you did.
*  Because I never met anybody like that.
*  I can't thank you enough because, again, it's a rare occurrence these days that
*  to be unaffected by the outside noise. And I promise you, I'll do better in making sure that
*  I'm a little bit more plugged into the help people are getting when they get out, whether they have
*  done it or not. We've had two recent resentencings. One guy was paralyzed and blinded in prison.
*  And he's in a wheelchair and he can't see. And part of the reason he was paralyzed is because
*  of poor medical care that he was getting. It was a difficult decision to make initially because I
*  said, shit, another resentencing, a guy that was found guilty. And then I saw the horrific medical
*  treatment he was getting and I said, you know, this just isn't right. You don't just throw out
*  a human being like this. And what threat is he in a wheelchair or blind? But, you know, I have to do
*  a good job of making sure that people are getting the attention and care they need. It takes resources
*  and, you know, we're thankful to everybody that continues to reach out and support any of these
*  causes. The Perlmutter Center, you know, the Midwest Innocence Project is a great one. The
*  Ohio Innocence Project, those are all satellite projects. But the Freedom Clinic at the Perlmutter
*  Center, we've had some terrific folks, including the Perlmutters, that have given us the resources
*  we need to make a difference. So I just have your, you're in my, I'm in your debt eternally.
*  You're not. You're not. You're not. I appreciate you very much. And my thing about the outside
*  noise is you should never put any effort or time or focus into something that has no net benefit.
*  There's no benefit in the outside noise. It doesn't do you any, especially if you're an
*  introspective person. If you're a person who thinks everything you do is awesome, maybe it's good to
*  see people shit on you. Maybe it's good to see that some people don't like you. Maybe it's good.
*  Maybe it's good to hear other people's perspectives, kind of like you put your ego in check. But if
*  you're a person that's introspective, and I know you are, if you're a person that is hard on yourself
*  when you make mistakes, no one's harder on me than me. I'm very hard on me. Oh, I know someone that's
*  that's as hard on themselves as you. He's sitting across from you. But it's course correct. You know,
*  if you if you look inward and you don't like what you're doing or what you've said or who you are,
*  don't do that again. One of the best things I did in the wake of this whole Sheldon Johnson
*  incident is I turned my comments off on Instagram and turned my account private.
*  I think I'll make it public again after today because I want to generate support for the Ohio
*  Four. And but turning comments off is a nice thing because you can't believe the good stuff or the
*  bad stuff. You just stay forward, especially for people in the public, the good stuff you can
*  get what they call audience capture. You know, you have enough people leaning you in a certain
*  direction or giving you praise for a certain thing, you start doing more of that. You know,
*  and this is a manipulative tactic that's used online, both for and against people.
*  Amen. Look, when I was on my way over here today, I was walking into the Uber,
*  and a guy at the hotel goes, I hope you're going to talk that talk over on the over on the jail
*  over on the JRE. And I said, Yeah, I am. And it turns out that he went to high school with
*  Rodney Reed, who's on death row here in Texas. And I got into an interesting conversation with
*  him. He's like, man, his older brother could pop and lock. Yeah, he goes, man, this motherfucker
*  was popping and locking all the time. He's telling me about him breakdancing. And he's like, no,
*  for real, you know, shining a light on this stuff gives a lot of people out here hope.
*  And I told them that, you know, I wrote a letter to the legislator here in Texas that's reconsidering
*  that case. So it's just real cool, man, to get to get people behind it that really care about
*  this stuff. And, you know, the public can really help out, you don't have to be a lawyer, you don't
*  have to be a psychologist, you don't have to be a therapist, you know, pressure does break pipes.
*  So reaching out to JD Tomlinson and making noise between now and December 31. And as you said,
*  talking about things on this podcast have actually exonerated people.
*  Yeah, I thought this one was probably better off just me.
*  Let me think real carefully about about the next. Yeah, I know, Jamie and I were both talking about
*  is he think he's going to bring somebody in? Fuck, you certainly can. I mean, you definitely
*  can. Hey, listen, next time around. And if it's the Ohio for great. Hey, listen, the guys that
*  have been on here are all thriving. Yeah, Bruce Bryan. Yeah, works at the Queen's defenders office.
*  He has not been without challenges. Trust me. But he's actually going I'll leave you with this.
*  Bruce is going to hope hope that parole lets him because we're still working on his full
*  exoneration, even though he was granted clemency on it on the innocence claim. Bruce is going to
*  Nairobi and Uganda to speak to prisoners there. Well, and he's a client advocate for the Queen's
*  defenders. Derek continues to be a whirlwind of positive activity. He's just amazing. He's
*  getting people out left and right. Robert Robert Johnson, who we had on is continuing to do amazing
*  things down in New Orleans. And all of them are just thriving. They're doing well. Not enough
*  attention is given to the happy endings. Right. Then we give to the bad stuff. But of course,
*  I mean, that's just how people are. Why is that? Well, you know, with the first of all, they're
*  afraid of crime. So they they highlight the instances where things are bad and things do go
*  bad. And they don't they don't want to look at the disgusting aspects of the legal system. They want
*  people want to live life through rose colored glasses and have this perspective that the
*  bad people go to jail. But it's not just about crime. Most of the headlines that get the most
*  clicks are about someone having a fucking affair, somebody dying. Right. A lot of triumph in the
*  news. Well, people like when other people's lives suck. Why? Because it makes them not think about
*  the suck of their own life. That's why they like it when a celebrity falls, like a PDD gets arrested,
*  because they see these people living these lives they could never imagine, like yachts and
*  Rolls Royces and all that shit. And then they see them get taken down like, yeah,
*  because they were, you know, envious. And it's also like, it's a part of our culture is to
*  celebrate wealth in the most disgusting and extravagant ways, you know, like, I mean, how many
*  social media personalities have emerged just complete just all about look at all the stuff I
*  have. Look at all the things I have. Look at all the famous people hanging out with look at all the
*  girls. Look at the yacht. Look at the car. Look at the jet. Look at this. Look at that. Look at
*  all the things you can't get. And when those people get got, people love it. You know, who,
*  you know, who folks are probably clamoring gets got? Oh, if that's the basis, and I don't agree,
*  who's that fucking guy's always got his shirt off? He's taking pictures on yachts and shooting
*  machine guns. Oh, Dan bills. Oh, man. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to peek into his brain one day.
*  Mm. Yeah, it's probably a lot going on in there. It's, it's interesting how people do become
*  famous for that, though. It's like showing your stuff makes you famous, showing a life that
*  other people can't really imagine ever living. But think of the hypocrisy and the in the inner
*  conflict and turmoil that that exposes. So in other words, we want people to fail that somehow
*  innate in many of us. It makes us feel better about ourselves. Yet you will have 3 million
*  followers or 10 or 15 following someone that, and I'm not talking about that guy, whoever
*  who is clearly just selling their looks or their lifestyle or whatever it is. So yet we're drawn
*  to it and we want to watch it. And then when the person fails, we want to fucking devour them
*  to the point where there are carcass laying in the street. Sure. Celebrity marriages and divorces.
*  That's another big one. Love it when celebrities get divorced. Ha ha ha ha. You're miserable too.
*  Do you love it? No, no. People love it. I find it fascinating when people keep getting married and
*  keep getting divorced. It's goddamn how many times can JLo get married before the next guy's like,
*  Hey, I don't know if this is gonna work out. Yeah. Is it really Ben Affleck? That's the problem.
*  Who's the problem? Well, he's certainly a problem as well. That guy, Mark Anthony seems like a nice
*  fucking guy. Seems like a sweetheart. She married a bunch of dudes, but you know, whatever. She's
*  obviously a lot of work. That's it. You want a diva? Good luck. That requires a lot of work.
*  I just want to understand it all. I just want to like, me and my brother, he'll sometimes go,
*  what's it all about? It's definitely not all about caring whether or not JLo gets divorced again.
*  You know what I find difficult? I've been playing with this idea in something that I'm writing
*  right now, and it couldn't be more prescient than right now is that this notion of what the truth is.
*  I don't know what like we had it happen to us right here. Are some of the swing states requiring
*  ID or all of them? It's hard to keep a grasp on reality and the truth these days because there's
*  information that is intravenously injected into your veins, it seems like. So I have a hard time
*  knowing what's true anymore. Well, the news itself outright lies. It's not like a conversation like
*  we have where Jamie checks it in real time and I saw a thing that said the swing state or the
*  states that required no voter ID were the ones that she won. She won other ones as well. But
*  when you have the news saying things, so they have researched it, they do know that it's a lie. This
*  is not like a live conversation like we're having where I didn't know we were going to talk about
*  that at all, nor did you. It just spontaneously came up. These people are putting narratives out
*  there that are just flat out lies and they're doing it all the time. Obama did it during the
*  campaign where he repeated that lie about Donald Trump talking about white supremacists saying
*  they're very fine people on both sides. So just a flat out lie. Well, that was the
*  unite the right. Well, it was all about the statue, the statues of Civil War people being taken down
*  and he's saying, I'm not talking, literally said, I'm not talking about white supremacists
*  and the KKK. They should be condemned. He said, I'm talking about people that came out.
*  Did he say that in the same? Oh yeah. Oh, you can see it. So weird. Go to the JRE companion Instagram
*  because on that page there is what Obama said and then on the same video there is what Trump
*  actually said and it's disgusting. It's a disgusting lie and it's a guy who's as
*  and he's talking about George Washington. He said, George Washington had slaves.
*  So Thomas Jefferson would take down Thomas. Let's play it so you could see it here.
*  Said that there were very fine people on both sides of a white supremacist rally.
*  And you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were
*  very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group. Excuse me. Excuse me. I saw the same
*  pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to
*  them a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
*  George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner?
*  So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down?
*  Excuse me. Are we going to take down? Are we going to take down statues to George?
*  How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?
*  Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner.
*  Now we're going to take down his statue. So you know what? It's fine. You're changing history.
*  You're changing culture. And you had people and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white
*  nationalists because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group
*  other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay. And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
*  Now, see, see, see, that's crazy. I have never, I have never seen that last part of it. Yeah.
*  So here is my struggle with the truth unfolded. I've never seen that part. Because the news has
*  said that lie over and over and over and over and over again. That the news, the mainstream
*  corporate controlled news that wanted this narrative that Donald Trump was a Nazi said that over
*  and over and over again. They repeated it. They compared him up until the election. Joy Reid
*  was literally comparing him to Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini and spent a whole piece describing
*  right-wing dictators that he is going to be a right-wing dictator just like Hitler,
*  just like Stalin. This is the lie of the media. So this is one of the reasons why it's so hard
*  to tell the truth. It should be illegal to do that. It should be illegal to say that
*  because it's not true. And you're changing the perspective of millions of people,
*  especially low information voters that look at Obama like a thing from the past when time was
*  sane, when the world was normal. A brilliant guy who was the president. If this brilliant guy is
*  willing to lie in front of everybody. Yeah, but here's the thing. There's no question. They all
*  lie. Trump included. We talked about that earlier. He lies also. This is like the problem.
*  Right, but did he lie about Biden and about what Biden did? Did he lie about any of that? No.
*  He's lied plenty. I'm sure. For sure. But in the context of a campaign where you're completely
*  distorting the perspective of the person you're running against, not just who they are, but what
*  they've done and what they've said and what they stand for. He does the same thing though. But did
*  he do that with Biden? I believe he did. How did he do it? I think that there were many times where
*  he would accuse him of having created the problem at the border, that it was all his creation.
*  People don't seem to remember that when Trump was president, his border policies of separating
*  families at the border was not great. It was not great, but do you understand that Obama had those
*  exact same policies? I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying you can distort it. But you know that this is just what they do with children
*  when a parent's arrested, they separate the families. That happened under Obama, but under Trump,
*  it wasn't just separating the children. It was separating them for indefinite periods.
*  So is there a difference in the way Obama handled it in the separation? I'm not going to speak to
*  something. I don't know. Right. So that's a problem, right? So it's a problem if you're accusing him of that.
*  Here's the thing. I think they all lie. I don't have, I don't, I didn't follow it closely enough to say-
*  I think they all lie too, but there's not a thing like that that I can point to where he was saying something
*  about Biden that was factually incorrect. Here's the thing that turned me off completely about
*  the election this time and why I said, fuck it, I'm voting for Jill Stein, a physician that probably
*  is the least qualified of anyone, only as like my form of saying, I'll protest it. Kamala Harris
*  during the debate said that there's not a single, it was some remark, but there's not a single American
*  soldier deployed in a war zone. And then I saw videos of American soldiers in a war zone watching it
*  like in parallel reality. What the fuck is she talking about? Well did you see Dan Crenshaw post
*  about that? Where are we right now? They were in a fucking foxhole or in a tent. Dan Crenshaw posted
*  all of the soldiers, all the numbers that we have. See if you can find that post, it's on his Instagram.
*  In response to that, you know, Dan Crenshaw who lost his eye in war, he was Navy SEAL. He was the one
*  that was circulating the clip about of me being critical of her. Well it's a good clip. Yeah,
*  solid clip. I stand by it. Yeah, and you were correct. I mean, and then the crazy thing is you
*  had a conversation with her about that. Yeah, it was on Zoom and she couldn't answer a question
*  then and she can't answer a question now. She still refused to answer a fucking question. That was the
*  most frustrating thing. I mean, how about saying, look, obviously what happened at the border is a
*  crisis. It was not handled well. Here is what I plan to do different. It's outside of at least her
*  capacity or willingness to do something like that. But it was also the complicit nature of that
*  the media was in on it because they were fact-checking Trump constantly. They didn't
*  fact-check her on that. Something that should be immediately fact-checked. Especially during a
*  debate. I agree with that. First of all, how did you not know? How do you not know that? You're
*  either lying or you don't know that we have troops deployed on the war zone. Hey listen, maybe you're
*  right. Maybe it is that Trump repeats things that he heard that are moronic and nonsensical sometimes
*  and that takes away from the great he can do. He definitely does that. Right? Like talking about
*  people eating dogs and cats and the election being rigged. All sort of baseless shit takes away from
*  the fact that the things that stick out to him and it's like, get out of your own way, bro.
*  He pardoned Jack Johnson. He pardoned one of my clients. I think that he has done more and cared
*  more about criminal justice reform than certainly than any other president in my lifetime. No one
*  ever wants to highlight the good things that that guy's done. That's why I just did it. It's
*  frustrating to me because it's like, just don't listen to the last thing everyone told you because
*  you can be great. You can. I mean the fact that he does what he wants and says what he wants and
*  gets elected. Look at this. This is what Dan Crenshaw responded with. No US troops active
*  combat zones? How did ABC let Kamala get away with that during the debate? US sailors and marines are
*  fighting off Houthi attacks in Yemen. Over 3,400 troops are engaged in Iraq and Syria. We have
*  forces in Western Africa battling terrorists. Just this year three US soldiers were killed and 40
*  injured in Jordan by an Iranian-made drone. Nearly 1,000 troops are still deployed in Syria
*  and 2,500 remain in Iraq under Operation Inherent Resolve. So that's crazy. Yeah, it's a crazy thing
*  to say. But it also just shows you how corrupt the relationship is between the media and what we get
*  to see. It's corrupt. There's a bunch of people that had decided that they were going to fact-check
*  Trump continually and not fact-check her. And they were doing this because they wanted her
*  to look better than him because they wanted her to win. Yeah, I mean listen, the most...I have...
*  I have... and this is why I mentioned, you know, it's hard to know what the truth is. Right. The
*  reason why I posted all the exhibits, the reason why I put the letter up, and the reason why I put
*  the contact information up is that when you have a transcript and you have, you know, actual
*  documentary evidence, that's hard to argue with. It's not a sound bite. It's not a clip. So I feel
*  like maybe part of what appeals to me about this work is trying to get closer to the truth, a truth
*  that is a bit more provable. You know, I would probably have been very happy as a mathematician
*  if I was any good at math. I stink at it. But I think that there is...it's very difficult to
*  understand. You know, I feel like I'm sitting here and I feel manipulated by the fact that I never...
*  and it's really on me that I didn't go and watch the entirety of that comment. Right. Because I
*  literally don't think I've ever listened to the part where he says obviously the neo-Nazis and,
*  you know, the people that were there for the wrong reasons need to be condemned. You know,
*  when I was watching recently, I was talking to the great Dubini about this. He pointed out to me that
*  comment about Liz Cheney. And then he's like, go watch the full clip. Right. It's another one. And
*  I watched the full clip and I was like... It's enraging. This is so out of fucking context.
*  So then you start to wonder, well, how much is my opinion of him been formed by
*  my concern about other people lashing out at me? Yes. I mean, you should hear the shit I got
*  when I spoke ill of Kamala Harris by, you know, I guess call them the left.
*  You know, and it was like infuriating to me, you know? So I don't... Politics to me is too...
*  It's too much of, you know, you have to serve so many different interests that you sort of forget
*  who you are and what you stand for. So that's what turns me off about it. And, you know,
*  I don't think that that'll change. That's why I sort of shifted to... This is the most I've talked
*  about politics in probably five years, but that's why I've shifted to, let me just put my head down
*  and get to work on what I can work on. Yes. Well, I think that's very practical. And I think what
*  you said is very important for people to understand that a lot of what people say, they say it because
*  they don't want people to attack them. They say it because they think that if they say it, it will
*  clear them. They'll be okay. If you say you support X, you might not even support X, but if you say
*  you support X, you're not going to get attacked and the right people will leave you alone or agree
*  with you and appreciate you or praise you. Thank you for saying that. There's a lot of that out
*  there. There's a lot of people that don't speak their mind. Do you know how many artists that
*  have reached out to me that are like fucking hippies, man? Like artists, like musicians,
*  comedians that thanked me for endorsing Trump because they can't do it. They said they want to,
*  but they don't want to be attacked. They can't say it. They think the country is going in the
*  wrong direction. They think that this control of social media by the government, which we would
*  have had pretty much fully if it wasn't for Elon buying Twitter, that this is a dangerous precedent
*  to set, whether it's a right-wing government or a left-wing government. And that what you see
*  that's happening in the UK where people are being in prison for tweets and Facebook posts. Yeah.
*  It's fucking crazy. In the UK is the part that's mind-bending about it to me.
*  The whole thing is nuts and it's a dangerous path that we were on. We were on that path.
*  Trump has vowed to have free speech become a very important part of what he's standing for.
*  And that this censoring of information needs to stop. And that we need to stop all government
*  influence and what people have to say. Yeah, look. That alone.
*  That shouldn't be as revolutionary as it is. I know. It should be a core tenet of what,
*  I mean, it's essentially the First Amendment. And I think it's so transferable to what I do
*  in this context because a lot of the reluctance of prosecutors not to do the right thing or what
*  their conscience tells them is the fear of the backlash. Yes. How will it hurt my chances in a
*  re-election? Of course. And so that's what I hate about politics is you serve so many masters.
*  It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. And you gotta have nuts of steel.
*  Or you have to be a fucking sociopath. It's either or. You have to be a blindly ambitious
*  sociopath who can weave your way through these sort of social and political relationships and
*  get to the top. For what? Imagine if one of those persons does wind up becoming president
*  that has no real thought or no real care about the country, no real ambition other than the
*  blind serving of their own success. Well, I think that that's what, for people that are so like,
*  it's hard to explain if you didn't live in New York. For people that are just like,
*  oh my God, what's the next four years gonna be like? Like it's a funeral. Get up and do
*  something all four years that you think is gonna help make society better. You do that.
*  Whether it's getting out and knocking on doors and making your, for whatever you're passionate
*  about, not just when an election is coming up, but get out and knock on doors, get out and get
*  involved in some organization that you believe in, do something that you think will help lend
*  itself to bettering society in some way. What happens is every four years there's this polarization
*  and people get on one side or the other and they complain and bitch and then they wallow in it
*  too often for too long a time. I think that the people that actually make the most change happen
*  are the ones that can sit and talk with people that might have different beliefs than them
*  and don't make them other than. Absolutely. Right? I mean, anytime I've made an emotional decision
*  in business personally, it's never gone well for me. Right. So people are gonna have different
*  points of view than you. I was talking to my cousin about it and I was trying to help her explain
*  that just because you voted for Trump, that doesn't make you bad. I said,
*  her whole thing was, well, if you have daughters, there's no way you can vote for him. I said,
*  here's the fundamental flaw in how you're looking at this. There are some people that are pro-life.
*  That doesn't make them wrong. That makes you have a different opinion than them. You have a
*  disagreement. And if the basis of your vote is that you're pro-choice and they're pro-life,
*  okay, have a disagreement. I just don't understand how a singular issue like that,
*  and I understand that. Listen, I understand it from a woman's perspective. I'm a father of two
*  daughters. I talk to my wife about it often, especially going to Florida where the laws on
*  abortion ain't the same as they are in New York. And I understand it from a woman's perspective
*  completely. And I actually disagree with overturning Roe versus Wade, but you cannot be that myopic.
*  You just can't because if you're that myopic, you're gonna then find yourself in a corner
*  on one issue. And life is a little bit more robust than that, isn't it? It's more nuanced.
*  That was the better word. It is more nuanced. Well, listen, my brother, I love you to death.
*  I appreciate what you do. I think the world's a better place because of what you do. I really
*  do. And I think you've changed a lot of people's perspective on the legal system. And I'm glad that
*  we didn't let what happened with Sheldon change that. And I think there's just so much more great
*  work to be done. Well, my continued profound gratitude to continuing to let me tell these
*  stories. I promise the next time I bring a guest on, they will be well, they will be vetted.
*  The guests will be vetted a lot more thoroughly. There's no way you could have known.
*  There's no way I could have known. And it was interesting because I was for 48 hours, I felt
*  what it was like to be a headline. And then I was like, this sucks for the wrong reasons.
*  I know you were in a dark place, but I'm glad you got out of it.
*  Yeah. And it's not about me. It takes time.
*  Yeah. And I just, I'm really, really, really appreciative of this. And if that can't shake
*  the foundation of this forum, I think we're going to just keep on making great change happen. And
*  hopefully we free the Ohio for and keep on moving. Yeah. And I hope we do do a podcast
*  one day with them. Deep love. Deep love to you too. Goodbye everybody.
