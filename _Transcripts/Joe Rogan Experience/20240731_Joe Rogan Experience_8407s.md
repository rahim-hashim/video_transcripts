# JRE MMA Show #161 with Khalil Rountree Jr.
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1EbT055Iv8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Yeah, what's up? Good to see you man. We're back, we're back, we're back.
*  We're just talking about eating pigeon. So I was in Europe and I had a pigeon and it's a red meat.
*  Wait, pigeon's a red meat? Yeah, it's red and they serve it very rare.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know. Wait, first of all, eating pigeon is just, it's different.
*  But you're telling me that it's red meat and they serve it rare. Yeah, it's rare.
*  I need more details. I know, that was a little stunt too.
*  Well, the chef basically brought us out food, right? We didn't order off the menu, he just brought us out this food.
*  And when the pigeon came, yeah, it looks red, man. Like it looks almost like you're eating a piece of steak.
*  It's like before you prep it, you know? Like this is not what I would expect it being, like getting served this.
*  Well, there's a bunch of different birds that have red meat, like ostrich, ostrich's red meat.
*  I didn't know that either. Yeah, I used to get ostrich burgers at Fuddruckers. I think Fuddruckers went under, unfortunately.
*  You know what? I think I did have an ostrich burger at Fuddruckers like years ago.
*  Yeah. Now that I think about it. It's the shit. It's very good.
*  Okay. Wow. So wait, tell me more about this. What's the word again? How do you say it?
*  Squab. Squab. That's what they call it. They call it squab.
*  But this guy just said it was pigeon. It's like pigeon breast. Yeah, it's just pigeon breast. It's like a red meat.
*  It does look kind of juicy on it. Like when you see a pigeon, they're pretty jacked. So I'd imagine it's a good cut.
*  Well, this conversation started off air because that's what it looks like. That's the rib eye of the sky.
*  Oh, okay. That's Sandhill Crane. Now look at that. Doesn't that look like beef? Yeah, it looks like beef.
*  They call them rib eyes in the sky. That's Sandhill Crane's. Wow. It's delicious apparently. I have never had it, but it's supposed to be insanely delicious.
*  Wow. Yeah, they had them in Texas. That's a big one in Texas. That's interesting.
*  Yeah. So we were talking about animals that have been modified. Like we were looking at Carl and we're like, how crazy is it that a human over thousands of years,
*  altered by select breeding, created that thing? It's kind of nuts. Yeah. I mean, since we're on that topic, this is kind of weird.
*  There was one night I was going down this crazy like YouTube spiral and there was some guy who was just making creations.
*  Like he used human. He was just cross fertilizing shit. Oh, God. Yeah, it was the craziest thing ever. I don't know.
*  Chimeras, right? I don't know what the hell you call it. So he was like making these creatures and then they were like living in these jars and then it would fast forward like, you know, three weeks, four weeks and they're growing.
*  And one of them had this like crazy little eye and it was the weirdest shit I've ever seen, which then led me down going in another spiral where it's like apparently there are people around the world who will like do like breed, breed like goat mix with like fucking human.
*  And like, it's just weird, man. There's a whole other world out there. There's a whole other world out there. The Russians were trying to do that in World War One or World War Two. Which World War was it?
*  So the Russians were trying to make a hybrid human slash chimpanzee. And the idea was you get a super violent psycho human and you don't have to worry about Russians dying.
*  You got this fucking creation because Russians were dying by the millions. World War One and World War Two were fucking up. World War One.
*  Or World War One. Unbelievably brutal. So hybridization of animals is famous for controversial attempts to create a human-ape hybrid by inseminating three female chimpanzees with human sperm.
*  Yeah, it's wild. Yeah, bro. They were trying wild shit. They were trying to make something so that they could send it off to war.
*  Do we have, did they succeed? We don't know. See that's the crazy thing. Where are these test things going? Where are the test subjects? You know, like what the hell happened?
*  Listen, I think we both agree. For sure there's a clone out there in the world. Right?
*  There has to be something. There has to be. Right? They must have tried that. They've done it with sheep. You can get your dog cloned. You can get Carl cloned.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. JJ, no hesitation. Yeah, please. If you get Carl cloned, I want version two because Carl's is amazing.
*  Expensive clones. Yeah, Carl's. Yeah, they're very expensive, right? It's like 25 grand, I think. That's how much I would sell them for.
*  Oh, yeah. Carl's be worth some money. But I think it's a lot of money, but they can do it.
*  But I mean, the whole Dolly the sheep thing, like when that was the first animal they cloned, I think there was a bunch of failed attempts.
*  So, you know, what is the odds that it comes out exactly like your dog? It might be all fucked up. Yeah. Psychotic. Might have no soul. You don't know. Yeah. Right.
*  It may look like your dog, but who knows what the hell is going on. It'd be real creepy. Like fucking chew on wires.
*  It's like the very dark, like satanic version of your dog. A pet cemetery. Yeah, exactly. Remember pet cemeteries? Yeah, dude. Yeah, you bury the pet.
*  Like the pet comes back, but now it's still kind of your pet, but now it's evil. Oh, fuck that.
*  No, just thinking about that, it freaks me out. But I think that, I don't know how I went down that spiral, but. Oh, you can go down some YouTube rabbit holes, man.
*  Yeah, I do. I've gone down some serious YouTube rabbit holes. Yeah. I spent like four hours once researching this theory about Neanderthals.
*  That this guy, there's one dude that thought that Neanderthals, we have this idea of Neanderthals that they look just like us. Okay.
*  And he thinks no, he thinks they probably look more like gorillas, like, and they probably were covered in hair and they were probably able to see at night.
*  And they were probably super violent and they might have hunted us. So he had this whole theory about like these super predator chimpanzee looking Neanderthals.
*  That sounds interesting. Yeah, crazy, dude. Crazy. But most likely not correct.
*  Most people, the real anthropologists that have studied this stuff, like, no, no, no, no. We know some of them had red hair.
*  But red hair could be like orangutans have red hair. Yep. You know, but they had giant eyeballs, you know, and they were just very different than us.
*  But close enough that we're we interbred with them. Yeah, I got to see this. I mean, like this type of stuff. Super interesting.
*  Like, it's hard for me to get into like fantasy books and stuff like that. But like YouTube videos. Oh, yeah. You know, like this Neanderthal like kind of theory or whatever.
*  I spent so much time just going down rabbit holes. Brain ticklers. Yeah, I don't know if it's made me a better person.
*  It just fucks up your thought process, right? Just like driving down the street and then random thought about. Yeah, it'll make for good conversation.
*  You know, I always have like things I could pull up. Did you know? Yeah, there's always stuff in there.
*  It's nice to have the friends that kind of are in the same little like, you know, they're open to kind of some of the weird shit.
*  So you're going to have fun conversations. And I have friends that go too far. I call Eddie Bravo up and I'll just go, I gotta go. He's so deep.
*  He's so deep in the CIA. MK Ultra, like the deepest of the deep. Yeah. He's in that shit all day long.
*  And my friend Kurt Metzger, he's the worst. If I call him up, like he knows everything about every conspiracy that's ever happened.
*  And he knows all the people that were involved and they'll start rattling things off to you like, oh my God, you give me anxiety.
*  Yeah, yeah. Probably freaks you out. I can only imagine you're like, OK, stop.
*  Too much. Yeah. Especially today. It's just like seems like the world could fucking explode at any moment.
*  Any minute, dude. What the hell are we living in this? It's yeah, that's why I guess it's better to just kind of.
*  Yeah, you got to put a stop to like, yeah, what we consume, you know, like what information we want to like let into our brains because, geez, there's a was it Avi Levenovitch?
*  Is that the guy that was on the podcast talked about? He's a great phrase.
*  He you know, we have processed food is bad for you. Ultra processed food. This is processed information. Yeah.
*  And that's the way he described it was like, oh, yeah, it's like junk food for your brain.
*  It's like you're eating snacks instead of like taking a meal. Yeah, that's so crazy.
*  It reminds me. I don't know why. Kind of off subject, but on you know, the comedian Ronnie Chang. Yes.
*  So he had a really, really funny like a part in his most recent like stand up bit.
*  And he was he talks a lot about like, you know, social media and just like the Internet and this country, everything.
*  But he said one thing he's like something about like Americans. He's like, it's very common.
*  You know, Americans like I'll die for my country. I'll die.
*  He's like, how about you read a book for your country? He's like, how about that?
*  You know, and it was it was funny coming from him.
*  But I mean, like, that's I guess what brought that up is like, yeah, process processed information.
*  Right. We have a lot of fast, you know, info. Somebody can divvy up a video really quick and put it out there.
*  And it's the first thing we see. So we believe it, you know, or like something can go viral.
*  And we've seen it a bunch of times and then on to the next thing. And we're getting this information.
*  But like, it's a lot different than like, OK, let's let me pick up a book or like a couple of things and actually read it and see if these things.
*  Right. You know, a lot. And like, OK, now I can kind of formulate like, OK, this is closer to the truth and actual understanding the history of how these things are figured out, how this is formulated, what led to that.
*  And so it's just the article or worse yet, a YouTube or TikTok video. Yeah, exactly.
*  How many people are educated by TikTok today? Everybody. That's a lot.
*  I really firmly believe that it's like shifting the way people think about things in a negative direction.
*  I really I used to poo poo it. I think the algorithm, whatever.
*  But now I'm like, oh, it's definitely it's definitely fucking up the country 100 percent.
*  And I think China is doing it on purpose. I think it's brilliant.
*  Yeah, I mean, I've heard that I definitely don't have the.
*  Like capacity to figure out if it's like the truth or not, but I did hear that.
*  That's kind of crazy. Well, you know, their tech talk is very different than ours.
*  That's what I heard. It's like all like science and like positive stuff and martial art, informational martial arts, science achievements and ours is just like academics.
*  Yeah, ratchet.
*  The worst. Just the craziest stuff ever.
*  You see more people get shot on Instagram reels, those little what the and accounts I don't even follow.
*  Yeah. Right. So it's like Instagram knows that I'm watching fucked up things.
*  So they're showing me like, you know, failed carjacking attempts, all kinds of people get run over by trucks like every day.
*  I tried to create I created a tech talk like shortly because my wife was using it and she'd like they have like shopping or something on there.
*  So I was like, oh, let me just download it really quick.
*  So I downloaded it. And like after the first day, it started feeding me these like these these pages that were like homeless people in like Arizona and like California that were just like hooked on like fentanyl.
*  And I was like, what the hell? And they get deep into their stories like some guys like interview and then like how long you've been out here.
*  I'm sitting here watching this and like 20 minutes goes by and I'm like, why am I depressed?
*  Why do I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders right now?
*  And I realize like, holy shit, like I'm just I'm literally here in my living room watching like drug addicts on the street just like completely waste their lives away.
*  Meanwhile, you're living the life that they could only dream of.
*  If you take a young guy before his life goes sideways and say, what do you want to do with it?
*  It's like if I could just wave a magic wand, I'd like to be a bad ass fighting in the UFC.
*  Oh, fucking jack, young and strong and one of the top contenders up and coming.
*  And meanwhile, you're depressed. Yeah. Looking at people that you don't even know.
*  It's crazy, dude. It's crazy.
*  I think that's how they're doing it to us, man, because no matter where you are, there's something that you can watch that'll freak you out, freak you out, bring you down.
*  Just like change your mindset, slow you down, whatever it is.
*  I was talking to sugar Sean about that and he was saying that just scrolling through Tick Tock or Instagram stuff that doesn't have anything to do with him.
*  He goes, I just get this like mild form of anxiety.
*  It's like mild case. I'm like, I do, too. I do, too.
*  I don't know why. I think part of it for me is I know I'm wasting time.
*  I know I should be doing other things. I'm fucking busy.
*  Yeah. I'm watching people get shot.
*  Why am I watching it? I can't stop. I just keep fucking scrolling.
*  Yeah. Especially if you're taking a shit. Oh, that's the worst, dude.
*  I don't even know how to take a shit without my I'm like, I think I take one hour shits now because of my fucking because of my phone.
*  It's like I can't just get in there and do the business, dude.
*  I got to intentionally leave my phone outside to just to do what I'm there to do.
*  But if I bring my phone in there, it's a wrap.
*  It's a wrap because if I don't have my phone in there, I'm like Ricky Bobby and tell a day good night.
*  I don't know what to do with my hands.
*  What percentage of people take a shit with their phone now? I want to know.
*  Ninety nine point nine guys. Men. One hundred percent.
*  Yeah, it has to be a hundred percent. Yeah, it's how I find out half the things that are going on in my life.
*  You know one thing that bugs the shit out of me, though, if you're going to take a shit in a public place, like, for instance, like the P.I., right?
*  If I'm at the UFC P.I. just got to work out whatever I got to take shit.
*  The guy next to me turn your fucking phone down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like, don't blast it. I don't want to hear what you're listening to. I'm trying to watch my watch my shit.
*  Don't make me go in there with Bluetooth earpods.
*  That's that's when you know you're a degenerate. When you put your earpods in, when you're taking a shit, that's when you got a real problem.
*  Yeah, you've you've you've you've you're gone. You've gone too far down the rabbit hole.
*  Have you fucked around with any of that A.R. stuff, those goggles?
*  Augmented reality. I'm only like the the meta quest. I haven't tried the Apple Vision Pros yet.
*  Because I know as soon as I try the Vision Pro, it's over. I'm going to be wearing those things like.
*  Because when the meta quest came out, like when I first had it, like you can get me off the thing.
*  It's like look around playing these games, take it off like, oh my, wow, exhilarating.
*  But yeah, I know if I if I were to get the the Apple Vision Pro would be over because there's just so many cool things.
*  What did I see recently? There was something that they were using A.I.
*  This woman was talking to her deceased daughter.
*  Her daughter, young daughter died and A.I. had recreated her daughter.
*  And with with these goggles on these VR goggles, she was having a conversation with her daughter.
*  I was like, I like vaguely remember seeing something like that brand new, but I think it's this.
*  Oh, yeah, this is it. This is so crazy.
*  This is so crazy. Yeah.
*  I mean, seeing her deceased daughter and try to touch her.
*  Oh my God. This is like what we were talking about about the phone, right?
*  Like just putting ourselves through like this depression and stuff like, dude, this is crazy.
*  This is like this. She can't even touch her.
*  So she's like reaching out like she wants to touch her.
*  Yeah. And she's crying. Oh my God.
*  She's just hold the glove she has. She probably can feel some.
*  Yeah, probably how they're showing it to the viewer.
*  Oh my God. Oh, man. Look at that.
*  Look at that. I mean, it probably maybe a version of it that feels good to her, you know, but like this could be.
*  Oh, God. This could be pretty bad.
*  God, that's so sad. Oh, man.
*  Man, we're so close to the matrix. We're so close.
*  We're in the matrix. I think we might be.
*  You know, Michael Ballas was saying yesterday he thinks he thinks it is a simulation.
*  Elon said the chances of it not being a simulation are one in billions.
*  Yeah, he thinks it's 100 percent a simulation.
*  I there's too many things that that there's too many coincidences.
*  Right. Like even I might sound like an idiot for saying something like this.
*  I mean, think about this.
*  I mean, think about like stuff like The Simpsons, dude.
*  Right. Like you see those like Simpsons theories and shows like, come on, like this is too accurate.
*  Yeah, they called everything like this is years ago.
*  You know, like these episodes came out years ago.
*  How are things like this aligning or like how are these, you know, matching?
*  It just it's weird. It is really weird. It's really weird.
*  It's weird. And why is why is us being in a simulation any stranger than reality itself?
*  Just the universe itself, just the fact that we are one planet of nine in this one solar system
*  that is one of hundreds of billions of solar systems in this galaxy
*  and that this galaxy is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe.
*  The whole thing is so crazy.
*  The idea that we're in some sort of a program. Why is that more crazy?
*  Like everything about us is crazy. Subatomic particles are crazy.
*  The way our body is designed is crazy. Yeah.
*  The fact that you can make a car out of a wolf is fucking crazy. All of it's crazy.
*  Yeah. I mean, even listening to you right now, as I was as you were kind of breaking down
*  how pretty much insignificant we are, I just kind of like everything started zero and then I was like,
*  Oh, no, get out of this thought.
*  No, but you're absolutely right.
*  We are significant and insignificant at the same time. Yeah.
*  I don't think we're invaluable. I don't buy the thing like the like the people that are like really dark about it all.
*  I'm like, Oh, life is meaningless. It's like, No, I don't think that's true.
*  No, I don't think that's meaningless at all. No.
*  You know, like like you said, there's an equal like significance and significance.
*  Like when you look at the grand scheme of things, you zoom out. We're tiny.
*  Can't even see us. You know, if you're from an airplane, you look down, you can't even see the humans. Right. Right.
*  So that makes us feel a little bit small. But like, I don't know, something about us inside how we feel, how we perceive things, the power that we have in numbers.
*  Right. Like the intelligence that we have to create things like A.I. and laser beams and all this stuff.
*  Like, I mean, that's pretty damn significant.
*  We're very significant. We're just we're just a part of the whole thing.
*  The whole thing is just infinitely massive.
*  And we think of ourselves as small because we're just one piece of it.
*  But we're like, I think we're a critical piece of it.
*  And I think what we are is like the purveyors of creativity.
*  And I think creativity is like a thing that's in the universe of forces, intelligent animals to make things.
*  And I think we're like an antenna of this creativity.
*  And then we put it out there and then eventually we're going to leave this planet.
*  We're going to go to other planets and colonize and put that stuff out there in the world and probably not even in the form that we you and I are in right now.
*  Yeah. It'll probably some hybrid form, some hybrid form, some cyborg form.
*  There was an episode. I forgot the gentleman's name.
*  Man, super, super intelligent guy, older guy.
*  And he was talking about the different forms of like civilization.
*  Civilization. Yes.
*  Yeah. And how interesting was that? Yes.
*  Yes. You know, about Dyson spheres.
*  No. So they believe.
*  Excuse me.
*  This is just a theory.
*  But they believe that when a civilization reaches an incredible level of technological proficiency, they're going to be able to develop these enormous structures that capture all the energy of the star.
*  OK, so literally surround the star with this structure.
*  And they think they might have detected these structures in the universe now.
*  These structures are just theoretical.
*  OK, these Dyson spheres, but they believe through there's a thing called the James Webb telescope.
*  It's like the most powerful, you know, about that.
*  So this most powerful of space telescopes is now they're getting information that they think might indicate that these things could be a Dyson sphere.
*  So you can find anything about that. Huh?
*  So what is this?
*  So right here in our galaxy, what is that?
*  What is that? Just a tick tack.
*  See if there's an article.
*  Sixty Dyson sphere candidates.
*  Look at that.
*  Go up to the one that says candidates.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is from May.
*  So they they found these things amongst.
*  There's these.
*  I don't know how they detect why they think this is a Dyson sphere.
*  But if it just makes sense that if civilization can go from being hunter gatherers to being people that fly in airplanes and look at VR and enter into the matrix like we're clearly doing that if you just keep that going a thousand years, a million years, you're going to get to some insane level of technological ability.
*  You have to.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you, you absolutely have to.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe we are just like kind of in the beginning stages of like, you know, maybe there's humans elsewhere in this galaxy is far, far, far away.
*  Like some Star Wars type shit.
*  Right.
*  And we just haven't gotten there yet, but we're close.
*  I mean, we're seeing how close we're getting with everything.
*  That's what Terrence, Terrence Howard had a crazy theory about.
*  I have to watch that one.
*  I've seen little clips, but I've got a.
*  They're both good.
*  The first one's great because he just kind of goes kooky.
*  And then the second one's great because Eric Weinstein, who's like a legitimate genius from Harvard, sort of settles him down and explains what's incorrect and what what is correct.
*  And some of the stuff is very correct.
*  And some of the stuff is really fascinating.
*  He's Terrence is clearly a genius, but he's like self-taught.
*  And sometimes when you don't have peers correcting you and you got to have that, you have to have actual it's like if a martial artist like I got this move, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, I'm going to do this shit on me.
*  It works in the streets.
*  It works on everybody.
*  It's like, no, try it on me.
*  Like, but Terrence has this brilliant idea about that.
*  What happens is you have a star and then the particles that eject from the star are what creates these planets.
*  And when the planets get to a certain distance from the star, when they develop that Goldilocks zone, he goes, they eventually develop people.
*  And he thinks it's like people.
*  It's like when you see like crops growing.
*  Oh, it's the time of the year.
*  The rain and the soil crops are growing and they'll all they're far away from the sun.
*  They're people.
*  They're making people and that this is what happens.
*  And then as this as time passes in this society, if it survives, doesn't kill itself, gets further and further from the sun.
*  It has to develop the technological ability to keep the planet hospitable.
*  And then it goes even past that to the point where they develop these things like Dyson spheres and they develop the ability to manipulate their environment, create black holes.
*  They develop the ability essentially to create new universe.
*  It's ultimately over hundreds of millions of years or whatever it takes.
*  So he explained this and then someone you said stepped in and kind of like, no, that no, I did that.
*  He didn't correct because that's just a theory and it's a fascinating theory.
*  And you know, Terrence has a lot of like really interesting ideas, but that was one of the most interesting ones that like every solar system.
*  The reason why we see it here and the reason why when they look at the like the Webb Telescope has found a bunch of these planets are in the Goldilocks zone.
*  And he thinks that this is just a normal occurrence that these planets, as time goes on, our planet is getting further from the sun and eventually the sun will burn out.
*  But as time goes on, as our planet gets further and further from the sun, it's not going to be hospitable anymore.
*  It's going to get to a point where it's like Mars and Mars at one point in time was hospitable.
*  Mars, they think Mars had water on it. Mars might have even had life on it.
*  We don't know, but it could be billions and billions of years ago.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  So this theory is pretty wild that like all this stuff is just basically particles that eject from the sun and that eventually coalesce and form a sphere and form a planet.
*  And initially these planets are like very close to the sun and they're, you know, insanely hot.
*  But as they get further and further out, they reach that Goldilocks zone and that's when they start developing life and then ultimately develop a very highly intelligent form of life.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  Do we know where this theory like came from?
*  I think that's Terrence's theory. Terrence has 97 patents.
*  What does that mean? I don't know, because apparently people that have explained it to me say you can actually just file patents and the people that are working in the office,
*  they're not sophisticated enough to know, especially in various disciplines as to whether or not what you're saying is real or actionable.
*  It's like, is this something that you could really have a patent for? But they'll let you file for the patent.
*  Okay. So it's one of those things.
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  But the idea that every solar system eventually has a planet that gets to that spot where it's just enough so it gets water, just enough so it has like all of the things that's necessary for life.
*  And then if you want to get really crazy, then you think that the planets that are farther and further out that have the super intelligent, ultra advanced species, what they do is they come back and they help us.
*  They come back and they fucking pick up the pace, boys. You know what I mean?
*  Yeah. They give us a little crash UFO here and there. They give us a little this, give us a little that, maybe even manipulate us. That's the ultimate theory.
*  The ultimate theory. I mean, that sounds kind of cool, right?
*  Well, just like Carl, just like Carl, it looks very different than a fucking wolf. Right?
*  We look very different from all the people on the planet. Like there's so many varieties of humans.
*  We're very similar to dogs in that regard and that we can all breed with each other. But yet we look very different.
*  So you can take like a golden retriever and they breed him with a poodle or a labrador. You make a labradoodle.
*  Yeah. You know, but they're still dogs. Yeah. Right. But they look very, very different.
*  Well, that's only dogs that are like that. Right. Like fish, bass all look like bass. Yeah.
*  Zebras look like zebras. There's something about us that's fucking real weird.
*  And you get attributed to climate and different environments to grow.
*  And some of those changes have to have taken place from that too, for sure.
*  But if you buy into all this Anunnaki crazy shit, the reason why we are so different than all the other primates is because they introduce their DNA to us.
*  Yes. To like the, he created us and created us out of lower hominids. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Which is so fun. It's super cool. Yeah. I mean, like so fun to think if it's true.
*  I've looked at some of that stuff a little bit before, but I didn't allow myself to get too deep. Yeah. You can get deep on that.
*  But yeah, definitely an interesting like perspective and like way to like kind of break down humanity in a way.
*  Well, we are a mystery. You know, we are the ones who've created this theory of evolution and the fossil record and all those things.
*  But the thing that created it is the biggest mystery. The human brain.
*  The human brain doubled in size over a period of two million years.
*  And apparently it's the biggest mystery in the entire fossil record. They have no idea what happened.
*  Is it still growing or probably probably just growing slow, you know, another two million years now might double again.
*  Yeah. I wonder if there's any record of like, I don't know, maybe just the slightest, you know, record of like, OK, it's growing.
*  Right. I wonder for 500 years ago. Right. Now, has there been any right increase in?
*  Yeah, you get like the average brain size of everybody today.
*  Like how far back do we have really good records of brain size? You know? Yeah.
*  Got to go back to like Kennedy's assassination. Probably nothing, nothing earlier than that.
*  I mean, I'm sure there's an anatomy records that go further than that.
*  I mean, probably, you know, maybe the 30s or the 40s.
*  Like, when did they start studying the size and weights of human brains? I wonder.
*  I wouldn't know, but it makes actually I'm making notes right now like Terrence Howard.
*  Like, I got to look into this guy more. All I know is just Terrence is fast. You know, his acting.
*  Well, he's a great actor. Yeah, super great. He's a great actor.
*  But I mean, I think he's even more interesting as a thinker.
*  But the way he responded, I think showed a lot of character, the way he responded to Eric Weinstein, correcting him on stuff, because he didn't.
*  You know, he kind of tried to argue his point, but he didn't get upset.
*  He didn't get emotional about it and get attached to his ideas.
*  It was it was it which it showed he's a brilliant guy that doesn't have all the information, but he's brilliant.
*  But there's a giant difference between being a brilliant person and being a person that has information.
*  There's a lot of brilliant people that don't have any information. Yeah.
*  You know, which is why like there's there's people like I firmly believe that to be great at athletics, it takes a kind of intelligence.
*  And you're not measuring it in an IQ.
*  But to pretend that someone is like a Wayne Gretzky, he's not some kind of a genius, you know, or a Federer or or an elite MMA fighter.
*  You have to be a kind of a genius.
*  Yeah, because you're navigating this most difficult of world with micro second decisions get made, training, instinct, discipline, the will to carve out this existence and all those things.
*  You have to have a fucking truly, truly exceptional mind to be able to do those things.
*  I agree. One hundred percent.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Anybody that's doing things that just like a really high level or like they're doing things differently or they're like the number one, two and three in there in anything in anything.
*  Yeah, there's definitely a level of you're focusing at physics.
*  Well, everybody thinks you're a genius.
*  But if you're focusing on hockey, people don't think you're a genius or if you're focusing on chess, maybe people think you're a genius.
*  But if you're focusing on jujitsu, maybe they don't think you're a genius.
*  Yeah, it's kind of interesting. Yeah.
*  But I think they're all geniuses.
*  I think for sure.
*  I think every one of those people, if they had the physical capability, because obviously some people unfortunately have terrible genetics and they're just never going to be an elite athlete.
*  But if you have the physical ability, that's only like a little tiny piece of it.
*  The real piece is the mental part of navigating not just the training, but the improving and then the ability to execute under pressure.
*  Under pressure. You got to have the mental side to even drive the physical side.
*  You can be a physical specimen.
*  I how I'm built.
*  But I know nothing about football.
*  So it's not like I can just I'd have to develop some type of brilliance or some type of you have to train.
*  I'd have to train.
*  I have to think I'd have to do all these things.
*  You look like you could play football.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I look like I can play football, but my mind's not wired that way.
*  Right. So I'd have to do a lot to to make that happen.
*  And then obviously there's a lot of football players that look like a beast.
*  But if you get them in the cage, they have no idea what to do.
*  Nothing do they ever throw a punch.
*  We've seen it.
*  It's so crazy. We've seen it.
*  We've seen guys that like, you know, they're they're bad asses.
*  But there's a difference between being a bad ass versus a trained fighter.
*  Yes. It's just a whole different world.
*  And it requires not just physical work.
*  It requires a kind of brilliance.
*  And just because Terrence doesn't have that information, he's a brilliant guy.
*  If he had that information, he'd be even more brilliant.
*  He'd be more relatable to all these other brilliant people.
*  That's like that's really interesting, man.
*  I want to look into Terrence Howard more, actually.
*  Like this is fun. Yeah, I like this.
*  I like to I want to explore like the side that you're explaining to me.
*  I would have never really known.
*  But I'd like to be inspired by that.
*  I'd like to, you know, just hear this guy out.
*  Well, I had a reporter tell me about him years ago, and then I watched some YouTube videos of him.
*  And one of them, he was at Oxford talking to them about mathematics.
*  See, like, that's so cool. What the hell?
*  Yeah, what the hell? Crazy.
*  The whole thing was crazy.
*  But it's just there's, you know, we should be inspired.
*  There's a lot of interesting people out there in this world.
*  Yeah. A lot of people that have some really great ways of looking at things and inspiring stories.
*  You know, you think about like what they've done and how they've done it.
*  It really fuels us all.
*  Is there one of the reasons why we like sports when we're not even participating in it?
*  Because it's so inspirational. Yeah.
*  You know, if you watch a great fight and someone wins, like, oh, my God, that was incredible.
*  You leave, you're like energized. Yeah.
*  Or magic shows, comedy shows.
*  I mean, honestly, dude, honestly, much anything. Yeah.
*  Anything that requires that stuff. Yeah.
*  Yeah, you get you get energy from it. You really do.
*  There's there's a type of energy that we humans get from each other.
*  And I think that kind of energy that we get from each other doing things that also it's beneficial to us,
*  like evolutionarily, because I think it promotes more work and promotes things getting done.
*  It actually fuels things getting done.
*  So like similar to like the are you watching the Olympics right now at all?
*  I watched that fucking transgender woman boxer box, the female boxer.
*  What the fuck are you people doing? What? Oh, dude.
*  I haven't I haven't seen much every bar or whatever.
*  And anything that has a television right now, I've been traveling.
*  So I see like Olympics is on. Yeah. Right.
*  But one thing that I that I've noticed, it's like it's so weird.
*  It seems like the Hunger Games.
*  I would say all these like crazy outfits and just like, oh, you know, this is like extravagant thing.
*  I'm like, this is the Olympics now. Like, why is this?
*  It's so different now than it than what I remember.
*  Well, the Olympics is a giant scam.
*  There's two things going on simultaneously. OK.
*  You have the best athletes in the world participating in their disciplines.
*  That's that's happening.
*  And then on top of that, you have enormous amounts of money being made and none of it's going to the athletes.
*  It is a giant scam.
*  So the kind of people that are putting together that ridiculous opening ceremony,
*  we got a bunch of drag queens in the Last Supper and all that. Yeah.
*  I didn't understand that.
*  Nobody understands it because it's not made by athletes.
*  It's not made by the Olympics.
*  It's made by the people that are in charge of putting the Olympics out.
*  So they're the ones who are reaping all the money and sucking all the cash out of these athletes.
*  Not only do they do that, but then they'll go to places like Brazil.
*  And so if it's going to be in Brazil, they build this fucking enormous place for it to to participate in all the different arenas
*  where you have roads and then after that, nothing.
*  Yeah. So and then all the people there who are poor are like, hey, where the fuck did this money come from?
*  And why didn't you just spend it on this? The community? Why did you do this?
*  Yeah. Why did you do this for volleyball?
*  Is volleyball that fucking important that you didn't use that money to help people?
*  Yeah. Bizarre. That sucks.
*  The money they make is astronomical.
*  The Olympics makes billions and billions of money in television revenue and advertising revenue, and they don't give any of it to the athletes.
*  So it just goes to like the committee.
*  They just ballin. Wow. Yeah.
*  And these are the crazy people that are putting on the Last Supper with transsexuals.
*  That's that's what they're doing. Was it the Last Supper?
*  Yeah. I saw it was something out like it was something like some Greek nonsense.
*  That was they tried to say that after the fact.
*  The lady who was playing Jesus literally said she was Olympic Jesus.
*  She was joking around about being Olympic Jesus because she was in the same position.
*  Jesus was in the Last Supper. She had the halo behind her head.
*  It was they're being artsy. They're being fun.
*  You know, but it's not it's not the place for it.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's pushing this weird agenda in this place where people are already getting fucked over.
*  Right. The whole Olympics is just people getting fucked over.
*  Yeah. I mean, if you're the best athletes in the world representing your country.
*  Yeah. At the highest level, the highest level that possibly humanly possible.
*  For one, yeah, you should be getting compensated.
*  A shitload of money. You know what I mean? A shitload of money.
*  You should be getting compensated. Yeah.
*  And yeah, I think that there should be something that's more focused on the extravagance of like this moment of the athletes.
*  Yeah. Waiting so long to be able to do this.
*  And yeah, it should be more athlete focused.
*  Yeah. And not so much like a show.
*  They let some wacky gay dude get a hold of the fucking the reins.
*  And he decided to do this. And that's what it was.
*  Literally what it is. That's literally what it is.
*  And he just decided to have a guy in a beard.
*  This is true. This is the actual person that put it together.
*  That's that is who he is. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. They know who the guy is.
*  We don't need to name him. OK. He's getting enough hate as it is.
*  But the whole thing's fucking completely insane.
*  But my point is the whole Olympics are insane.
*  They're robbing people. They're robbing the athletes.
*  No one is tuning in.
*  There's not billions of people all over the world tuning in just to see a bunch of transsexuals pretend to be Jesus and the disciples.
*  That's not why they're tuning in.
*  They're tuning in to see who's going to win the 100 meter dash. Yeah.
*  Who's going to win this? Who's going to win that? Who's going to win the sprints?
*  Who's going to win whatever the fucking event is? Who's going to win boxing?
*  That's what people are tuning in.
*  And those people that have dedicated their entire lives to wrestle in the Olympic Games, they're not getting a fucking scratch of that.
*  That's so crazy. It's nuts. Oh, man. So it's nuts.
*  And there's nothing there's nothing to do about like nobody can do anything about that.
*  It's just pure K. Well, at one point in time, there was probably no money in the Olympics because there was no television.
*  Right. So at one point in time, the Olympics was just about the best athletes in the world competing against the other athletes, the best athletes in the world.
*  It was for national pride. You know, you bring a gold medal. You have a fucking parade when you get back home.
*  It was great. And it was probably very I don't know what the original like the one where Hitler was in the 1936 Olympics and he's fucking jacked up on math and he's rocking back and forth.
*  You seen that one? No, dude. You're putting me on so much game.
*  Put me on so much. Yeah, I got a guy coming on tomorrow to actually talk about drugs in the Nazis, like all the crazy drugs that they were doing.
*  They had to be on drugs. All kinds of stuff. For sure. Cocaine, free drugs. Math. Yeah, they were doing free drugs.
*  And there was no just say no back then. Everybody's like, what does this do? Keeps me up for days. Let's go.
*  So Hitler at the Munich Olympics is like he's on meth and he's rocking back and forth.
*  He's just amphetamine out of his fucking mind, just coked up, just rocking back and forth while everybody's watching the Olympics.
*  Show it to him, Jamie. Yeah, we need to see this.
*  We played this like, oh, my God, look at him rocking, dude. Look at him going. He's going. Oh, what a maniac.
*  He ruined that mustache forever. Yeah.
*  You know, just rocking back and forth. But back then, how many sports were in? Was that 36? 1936 or 38? 36.
*  How many sports were in the 1936 Munich Olympics?
*  Because now there's so many things, swimming and rhythmic gymnastics.
*  Shooting. Yeah, there's decathlons.
*  I don't know when it started, but there's only a certain number of events.
*  So if they like put a new one in, they got to take something out. Oh, really?
*  That's why I lost wrestling a few years ago.
*  Everybody got mad because they added like skateboarding or surfing or something like that.
*  Is that always been the case from the beginning?
*  I mean, not since there was only like 10 games to start with.
*  How many events were in the 1936 Olympics, though?
*  Because I know they may have might have put a cap on them in the future.
*  I don't know if they had a cap on it back then.
*  But my point is back then, like in the Jesse Owens days, you know, when Muhammad Ali won the gold medal,
*  like those guys weren't doing that for money.
*  For Ali, it was like a way that he could transfer into professional boxing.
*  And, you know, like with Meldrick Taylor and Purnell Whitaker, those guys got fast tracked.
*  Mark Breland, all of Evander Holyfield, all these guys in medals.
*  They were then used for the events they had. So they had a lot going on.
*  So they have a lot of stuff, but not as much as they have now.
*  I don't know.
*  I wonder. See if you can find how many more events are there in 2024 than there were in 1936.
*  We'll see if they say that.
*  But the point is, like, everybody who did the Olympics before television,
*  they just did it for national pride, just like winning the nationals in wrestling.
*  Of course. You do it just for the glory of it.
*  There's 32 sports.
*  329 events and 32 sports, including 28 core Olympic sports, contested in 2016, 2020.
*  And then what did it used to be in like 1936?
*  129 events. Wow. 25 disciplines.
*  So it's slightly less.
*  Got to love the AI overview, right?
*  Nuts. Nuts. Instantly give you all the things.
*  All the things.
*  The Olympics were often considered controversial because they were held to showcase
*  the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler's theories of Aryan supremacy.
*  All jacked up on code.
*  Fucking, fucking fast.
*  What a fucking maniac.
*  Yeah, nuts. So back, my point is, so back then there was no television revenue.
*  There was no one. No one was making billions and billions and billions of dollars.
*  So the Olympics started with, you know, a very pure intention.
*  Pure intention of just, you know, winning, being the best.
*  Be the best from your country.
*  But somewhere along the line, it became this fucking enormous business
*  and the athletes never got cut in.
*  And no one's ever spoken up about it, have they?
*  What can they do? They don't have any power. No one has any power.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  The TV networks don't want to change it. They're like, shut the fuck up.
*  Everybody's like, shut the fuck up.
*  This is getting us views.
*  Because they're just stealing. They're just stealing money.
*  Imagine if that was the case with the NBA or the NFL or UFC.
*  Imagine if the athletes got zero money
*  and everybody else is driving around in Rolls Royces and living in mansions.
*  That'd be crazy.
*  That'd be super crazy.
*  Yeah, you guys are fighting for glory.
*  Only glory.
*  This is not about money.
*  You represent your country.
*  We've done studies and it shows that when people fight for money,
*  they don't fight that hard.
*  Yeah.
*  So, what? That's the Olympics.
*  They're boxing for zero dollars.
*  They're punching each other in the face as hard as they can for zero dollars.
*  And this woman today got punched in the face by a man.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  They let a transgender, there's apparently two,
*  at least two transgender boxers that are fighting in women's boxing.
*  What the fuck?
*  I don't understand.
*  You can't understand because you're not retarded.
*  It has to be something wrong with you to understand.
*  To think that that makes sense.
*  All you have to do is say you're a woman.
*  But you're not though.
*  I say I'm a werewolf, but when the moon comes out, I stay a person.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is not real.
*  I want to understand from their part, their reasoning.
*  You're a nice guy.
*  You want to think that there's some part of this,
*  like there's probably some sort of a reason.
*  Oh, if they explain it to me, like, oh, I see your perspective.
*  Yeah, I want to see the perspective.
*  There's no perspective. It doesn't exist.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  Because that perspective would gray the line to like,
*  well, why not just let all men compete in women's sports?
*  Well, men would dominate.
*  And that's why you have Title IX.
*  There's a reason why men and women's sports are separated.
*  Because it's not fair.
*  Yeah, it's not fair.
*  There's a reason why the UFC has weight classes.
*  You're not fighting Brandon Marino.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Because it's not fair.
*  Right?
*  All these things are put in place to make things as fair as possible.
*  Weight classes, gender distinctions.
*  This article says they're not transgender.
*  What are you talking about?
*  That's what this says.
*  They may be intersex.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Is this today?
*  This is about them, yeah.
*  July 30th.
*  July 30th.
*  That's today.
*  But there is an athlete that they were saying was a male athlete that was competing.
*  Riley Gaines posted it on her Instagram.
*  It says they failed tests that came back.
*  Testosterone tests.
*  Elevated testosterone.
*  What does that mean?
*  So they took testosterone?
*  Is this an exogenous test?
*  Why are they calling this person transgender?
*  Are they female to male?
*  Like they're trying to transition to male?
*  Is that what they're saying?
*  I don't know.
*  What?
*  What article is this?
*  From Outsports.
*  What is Outsports?
*  Well, I may have to go to somewhere else.
*  But hold on.
*  What is Outsports?
*  What is that?
*  What is the?
*  Probably an LGBTQ.
*  Yeah, it's LGBTQ.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  So this might be biased.
*  Google Transgender Boxer.
*  And what is it saying?
*  Olympic Trans Boxers.
*  That's exactly where I started it.
*  They will fight in Paris.
*  Women's events.
*  Yeah.
*  But here it says this is the person.
*  Algeria's Inane Keel.
*  I don't know how to say that.
*  And Taiwan's Ling Yu Ting were disqualified from last.
*  God, it's pop ups.
*  Qualified disqualified from last year's Women's World Boxing Championships after failing gender
*  eligibility tests.
*  Okay.
*  That means they're transgender, Jamie.
*  That Outsports is a biased website.
*  It's unfortunately there.
*  It's kind of propaganda about this kind of stuff.
*  All right.
*  Scroll it up.
*  Scroll it up again.
*  So it says, yeah, the person that has the XY chromosome.
*  The Boxer's chromosome text came back as XY.
*  So that's a male.
*  It says it's alleged.
*  Well, at the time of the disqualifications, based on DNA tests, we identified a number
*  of athletes who tried to trick their colleges into posing as women.
*  The Association's president, Umar Kremlin, told Russia's Task News Agency at the time,
*  according to the results of the test, it was proved that they have XY chromosomes.
*  Such athletes were excluded from competition.
*  So I don't think Outsports is being honest about this particular thing, because there's
*  outrage all over the place about this one particular person that they're talking there
*  that did test for an XY chromosome.
*  That's a man.
*  I know it sounds horrible to misgender someone and all that good stuff.
*  All that's great until you want to fight women or even compete against women.
*  Let's just cut the shit.
*  Yeah, when it comes to competition, I guess.
*  Yeah, there's a level of like, it's just unfair or it can be.
*  Also, we're denying sandbagging, right?
*  Yeah, we both know what sandbagging is.
*  Sandbagging has always happened.
*  You would get it in all sports.
*  I remember when I was a kid, there was a kid that we were in Little League Baseball, and
*  there was a kid that was 15.
*  He was trying to say he was 13.
*  This motherfucker threw heat.
*  He threw heat.
*  He had a crazy fastball.
*  And everybody's like, how old is this fucking kid?
*  Little League throwing like 80, 89.
*  Trans boxer Hergie Bakhian Dan, Bakhian Dan, aims for gold medal.
*  This is also from Out Sports though.
*  Okay, so this one they're being honest about.
*  Right, but they're not being honest about that other one.
*  As he competes in the women's boxing division.
*  Wait a minute.
*  What does that mean?
*  Why are they saying he then?
*  This was the other one.
*  See, they're saying himself in his nation.
*  So this is a trans female to male competing in women's boxing.
*  Because they're saying him.
*  So Out would not be calling this person a male if this person identified as female.
*  But they're competing in women's boxing.
*  So this just means they're juicing up.
*  They're just cyborg-ing their way to the thing.
*  He proudly proclaims he's never taking testosterone on his social media accounts.
*  Okay, so he just says that he's a man?
*  So he's transgender just by saying it.
*  He's not doing any hormone replacement therapy.
*  Knowing his strong stance against discrimination he faced during competition.
*  So this is just a woman that says they're a man and competes with women.
*  That's different.
*  That's very different.
*  Especially if this person is not taking testosterone.
*  That's very different.
*  But the other one has XY chromosome.
*  That's a boy! Congratulations!
*  There's a lot, man.
*  That's a lot to take in.
*  That's a lot for my brain to even process.
*  Well, it shouldn't be about ideology.
*  It should be about biology.
*  You should have a biologist determine whether or not someone's male or female.
*  It shouldn't be like you just decide.
*  Like this article was nonsense too.
*  Because you're saying he competes in women's boxing.
*  Well, why?
*  Why would he compete in women's boxing?
*  If he thinks he's a man, go compete with the men.
*  Yeah, it's sad.
*  And what I mean by that, it's sad because in today's times,
*  it's hard to stay politically correct.
*  Right. It's impossible.
*  Even now I'm like, how do I even talk about this?
*  You get what I mean?
*  Without getting completely like, I don't know what to say.
*  I don't know what to say.
*  I don't know what...
*  But that's the trick.
*  The trick is getting you so confused by it all that you can't even discuss it.
*  And then you just sort of allow it to happen.
*  And you just allow it to happen.
*  And go, well, it's not me. What am I going to do?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you chewing on?
*  This is, try these.
*  That's Lucy's.
*  That's a Breaker.
*  Breaker.
*  Those are good.
*  Yeah, you like, ooh, it's good, man.
*  The espresso's good.
*  You'll like it.
*  Breaker?
*  Yeah.
*  You want to eat crack it?
*  Yeah.
*  Crack it and it'll, has a nice flavor.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  This is delicious.
*  Not bad, right?
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably banned from the Olympics.
*  I wonder if Nicotine's banned.
*  So, speaking of which, we should probably get to your whole story.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  So, you were slated to fight, it was Jamal Hill, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And which has been a huge fight for you and for him.
*  And explain the story.
*  Explain in your words what happened.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I was scheduled to fight Jamal Hill, co-main event, at UFC 303.
*  At the time, it was when Conor was still, you know, going to fight Chandler.
*  So, in preparation, leading up to that fight, I was, you know, I was, I was, I was, I was
*  was, how do I even say this?
*  I was working with a company who I like outsourced, like to take care of my supplements and stuff.
*  Like, hey, you know, I don't have the time to necessarily like pick what's right for me.
*  But these guys, I trusted them.
*  They promised me.
*  And they did your blood work.
*  They did everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Blood work, everything.
*  Like, you know, I trusted them.
*  I've taken their stuff before, passed drug tests before.
*  So, there was nothing for me to, you know, worry about.
*  And then I, it was brought to my attention from the owner of the company.
*  He was visiting my house and pointed out something that I was taking and shouldn't have been.
*  But it was sent to me from their company.
*  They mentioned, you know, they sent a letter to the UFC.
*  As soon as I took it, I had to, I mean, I called the UFC and I was like freaked out.
*  I was like, what the hell?
*  I didn't know.
*  So this stuff that you were taking was a part of like, it was a stack of things or was it like?
*  So let me, I want to get this like, I want to get this correct.
*  You know, like, because this is the first time that I'm, you know, speaking about this publicly.
*  So the most simple way that I can put it is I was outsourcing my supplements.
*  I was sent a blended supplement that I was not told that I should not take.
*  And the company knew that I'm a UFC fighter, that I'm under drug testing protocol, like all this stuff.
*  So they knew that and someone from their company sent me something that I shouldn't have taken.
*  And there was no like heads up.
*  Hey, this, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it just came.
*  And I continue to take my supplements as I've been doing.
*  And then when it was brought to my attention, like, hey, you shouldn't be taking this.
*  That's when I immediately alerted the UFC and like, so this is DHEA, DHEA.
*  And it wasn't even it was in a blended supplement.
*  So DHEA was inside of a vitamin type supplement that they sent me.
*  And we should also point out DHEA is not even performance enhancing.
*  So it's not like you could get any kind of an advantage.
*  It would help your health. It's kind of stupid that it's illegal.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's like when I looked at stuff from like the WADA list on why they banned it,
*  it just doesn't really make any sense, you know, and for it to have any type of performance enhancing benefits.
*  I'd have to take it for a long time and a lot of it.
*  And it still wouldn't even probably do anything.
*  You know, yeah, it's not a steroid. The point is, yeah, it's not like some crazy shit that you take and also like EPO or.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  So I don't understand if you told them that this was an accident.
*  Given given the understanding that this is not performance enhancing, why did they suspend you?
*  OK, so UFC, which is awesome, they've they've been so helpful, man, like Donna and Jeff and even Hunter.
*  Like, I'm so grateful for them. But they had to suspend me.
*  They gave me a two month suspension because. My test did come back positive.
*  As soon as I told them, hey, I just tested on May 4th, so I haven't gotten the results back yet.
*  But this is what I just found out I've been taking.
*  So it's probably going to come up on this test. So keep a lookout.
*  You like keep your eye out. So then they're like, OK, we're they like expedited my test.
*  They called it like, hey, we need this test back immediately because I was booked to fight.
*  And so I'm obviously this is like I'm panicking, dude.
*  I'm like, fuck, like everything is it could go down and I fucking didn't do anything.
*  You know, right. Now, the biggest moment of my life that I've been preparing for is is in jeopardy.
*  So UFC expedited the test. They come back and Donna calls me.
*  She's like, OK. OK, exactly. Excuse me.
*  Exactly what you stated did show up on the test.
*  Yes. So we have to issue you some type of suspension for a failed drug test.
*  So they just gave me two months.
*  But that's completely separate from the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
*  Oh, yeah. So that's what I'm in now. That's the situation.
*  So what are they trying to do? So.
*  I'm still suspended under Nevada State, but they still haven't given me the time yet specifically.
*  So yet today was supposed to be another hearing.
*  But as far as I know right now, it's going to be somewhere nine months or more.
*  Jesus Christ. Yes. For D.H.E.A.
*  For D.H.E.A. And crazy. So crazy.
*  And so UFC is there. They're they're trying to help.
*  And we're trying to get this like, come on, guys, like I'm being penalized for reporting, self reporting,
*  self reporting, something that's not even that's not even my fault.
*  Right. You get what I mean? Like I didn't intentionally do this.
*  So like it's just it's it's a really, really rough time right now, Joe.
*  Like it's it's hard for me to really kind of like keep it together, especially like you were saying,
*  like I was scheduled to fight Jamal and like I'm at a point in my career right now where, man,
*  I felt like I feel like I'm really damn close.
*  But now I don't I don't know what the hell's going on because I'm being held up by.
*  By all of this stuff. Yeah, you are really damn close.
*  You're really, really close. And every time we see you, you look better.
*  I was really looking forward to that fight because I think that would be that's a giant test.
*  You know, Jamal is a former champion. Yes.
*  And he's going to be angry coming off that loss to Pereira. Yes.
*  Man. Yeah. So you you're in limbo right now. I'm in limbo, dude.
*  It's and how many months ago was 303 303 was was in May.
*  May. May. May. OK. So here we're in July.
*  And so you still don't have an answer yet. And if it's nine months, was it would it be nine months from the day?
*  Nine months from the day. Eligible in six months from now. Yeah.
*  So you could maybe do December card. No, nine months.
*  No, nine months from from the day of a positive test.
*  I think that comes out. I think that comes out to February. Oh, wow.
*  OK. October, November. OK. Yeah.
*  Like February. So I wouldn't be able to fight until next year. God damn it.
*  Yeah, dude. And so like and you're so close in this so close heated up division, heated up division.
*  Things are moving. You know, guys are fighting.
*  Dude, I mean, like even to not fight this long, I mean, I don't think people have or it does so much for me financially.
*  Like, yeah, you know, I mean, like, dude, I got mortgage. Yeah.
*  Like shit. It's been it's been such a huge thing on also momentum, momentum.
*  Yeah, not fighting. I mean, and you're in your prime right now.
*  Yeah, dude. It's I when I even think about it, like it it brings up so many different emotions, you know, like I do my best to work through them.
*  And I've been training my ass off. You know, I like I've I've tried to do everything that I can in this time to just stay prepared and just even though even if I know that I'm going to be fighting next year or something like that,
*  like I'm just like, OK, I don't I have to I have to stay strong. I have to keep progressing. Right.
*  I have to continue to be better every time. Yeah. You know, every fight.
*  Well, you were after the Anthony Smith fight. You just you're so hot right now.
*  I mean, it's like on that level where like this guy might break through and become champion. You're in that range. You know. Yeah.
*  And that's I mean, that's where I'm headed. Like I'm so focused on whatever it takes to get to that championship.
*  And that Jamal Hill fight was like the way that I was looking at. OK, this is my way to prove that I'm ready. Yeah.
*  The only I mean, hopefully that fight can get rescheduled, you know, because my biggest focus right now is I mean, I want to fight Alex, man.
*  I just I know that that's going to be a great fight that everyone is going to love. Yeah.
*  And I know that as a strikers delight. Yes. And I know that I have to, you know, like, yeah, I've got to fight Jamal.
*  Maybe that'll maybe like if that happens first, then that'll still keep me in that position of like talks of like, OK, then now you're ready for it.
*  Who knows what's going to happen? Who knows how many fights it's going to take now? Right. For me to get that fight. Right.
*  That's the one to me in my mind that I'm like, that's the one that I want. Well, fortunately, Jamal, unfortunately for him, Jamal got injured.
*  Yeah. And so he had to pull out that fight to that whole cars that that fight switch so many different times.
*  Yeah. So when you think about but I think Jamal had a knee injury. Right. Yeah. It looked like something pretty bad. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And so that who knows what's going to happen with that. That could take him out for many months.
*  We don't know. I don't know if he had surgery. What was the extent of Jamal's knee injury?
*  I believe it was like a severe meniscus tear. Yeah. Something like that. Like a lot of fluid. It looked like. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So, you know, have you had any knee issues? Yeah. When I when I was 15, I broke my knee in the pit, hardcore pit. Oh, no.
*  Yeah. I was moshing going crazy. Some guy had some steel toe boots on and he was just flinging around and boom, kicked my knee and broke my tibia. Oh, God.
*  Top bone was sticking out. Christ. Yeah. And then crazy thing at the time I was on tour with the band that I was playing with and we were close to like Mexico.
*  So we went to this like shitty hospital like Southern California, like close to the border.
*  And I was only 15, 16 at times, something like that. And they were like, parents, insurance is like, I don't know.
*  I don't have anything. But my leg is the size of a football right now. Fix it.
*  So they like shot me up with some type of drug and put a brace on me and gave me crutches.
*  And they're like, peace. And I had to drive from Southern California to Vegas, which took us at the time two days because we had to make stops because I was in pain with a broken leg.
*  Nothing had gone. We were young. So my friends would stop at like Walgreens or something, get a bunch of cough medicine, Benadryl here, drink this.
*  You know, like just try to put me out because I'm in a van with a broken leg. Oh my God. Yeah, dude. It was crazy.
*  So I've broken but nothing, nothing torn or anything like that. But also that healed up and you're good to go. Yeah, I'm good now.
*  Yeah, it's kind of amazing when you think of how many fights you've had and all the kicking you do.
*  You've had no knee injuries. Nothing. Wow. No, dude. Yeah, thankfully. I mean, shit. It's it's been really good.
*  I feel better now than I ever have. Like everything's strong. This is this is great.
*  It's a great time for me as far as just like athletic like progression.
*  Dude, you look so good in that Anthony Smith fight. Thanks. I love that fight, man. I loved that fight. I was one of my favorites.
*  I watched it. I watched it back. That off speed when you hit him with that uppercut. Yeah.
*  I started you know, the crazy thing like I'm glad you point that out. I don't know.
*  I think I started that in the first or second round. That was something that I was like doing intentionally.
*  The reason why that's my favorite fight is because from start to finish, I was 100 percent locked in zeroed in.
*  I still remember that fight now as if it were yesterday. So like, you know, that hints are like the I didn't finish him because I was just locked in.
*  There was nothing like overly emotional. I was in there to eat, man. It seemed like I didn't I didn't feel emotional in that fight at all.
*  Everything was just locked in locked in strategy. Yeah. Pick my shots wisely. It was a masterpiece. Thanks.
*  And it's one of those fights where there's there's a certain time in a fighter's career where they make this breakthrough and you go, boy, he's right there.
*  Yeah, like they're right there. We're like, I want to see that guy fight all these other folks. I want to see that guy fight all these other killers in that division.
*  Yeah, that's where I'm at. Yeah. And that division is, you know, it's interesting because Alex is such a dominant champion.
*  But there's not a lot of compelling challenges for him. You know, it's Anko Lyev, who I think is going to be next.
*  I think they're they're pretty much saying that. Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense.
*  And then Jan Blachowicz, of course, because his fight was pretty close with Alex. I think it was a split decision. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
*  And he's for whatever reason not being considered. I think a lot of people looking past Blachowicz because he's older. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But you can't I mean, you can't look past anybody. Right. I mean, look how far Glover came. Right. Right. You know, like and I think, yeah, it's crazy. Yeah.
*  Well, at the elite, elite level. Yeah. There's just there's so many of those. Look, Blachowicz and Jan and rather Blachowicz and Anko Lyev fought to a draw.
*  Remember that fight? So those guys are like right there. Like there's so many. It's tightly contested fights in that division. Yeah.
*  I just I think I'm not like shitting on anybody or, you know, saying that like I deserve this any over anybody.
*  I just I'm excited, man. Like I just want to give the fans that fight. I want to give myself that fight. You know what I mean?
*  Like just for just for the for the experience. Like I don't plan to shoot any takedowns on this guy.
*  You know what I mean? I don't think he plans to shoot any takedowns on me. No. And I think that it's like and there's really when you have two guys that strike like we do and that are skilled.
*  And we like, you know, like we're thoughtful. We know everything's precise. It's not just we're not going there and just sling and bang.
*  Like Izzy says button pushers. Yeah. Yeah. It's not that it's two guys that would know, hey, man, this could end at any moment.
*  It could end in the first second, but it also could go five because the both of us are fucking warriors.
*  So I just think like and and while he's still doing his best, you know, like while he's still at the peak is kind of like because I'm doing my best and I'm getting to my peak and you get these two guys at the highest level and like, wow, that's a sick fight.
*  That's what I'm saying. That's a sick fight. It's not like me. That's what I'm saying.
*  You know, so like hopefully he continues to win. Hopefully I'm not suspended for that long. And if I have to fight someone else in between, like, you know, in between then. Okay. I understand.
*  You know, if it's Jamal Hill, if he gets back and they book us a five rounder and it's like, okay, who's, you know, winner of this can fight champion. Okay, cool. I'm down for something like that.
*  You know, but yeah, man, they got to work that out. Who is the head of the Nevada State Athletic Commission now?
*  Jeff Mullen. Is it Jeff? I think Jeff's reasonable guy. Very smart guy. Seems like it. Yeah. Well, I don't know how much say he has on how things get sorted out. Yeah, but he's a martial artist, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he's a lot of those.
*  A lot of those guys are, you know, I went, I went, so I thought that I was supposed to have my hearing, I guess you want to call it last month. And I showed up in person.
*  Like they allow public comments like time for the so the public can come in the beginning. So I came and I saw these guys and I'm like, oh, I know all of you.
*  You know, in my mind, I thought it was like some crazy thing, you know, like, oh, man, I have to go. So I showed up and I looked around the room and everybody sitting around this table like all the board. And I was like, oh, I've seen every single last one of you at every fight. Right. So I felt more comfortable.
*  And I kind of like let him know, like, hey, guys, I'm here. I think that my case is today, you know, they were like, no, it's not until next month. And I was like, okay, well, I just hopefully you guys can kind of look into the facts and just see like, yeah, this is not my fault.
*  Not only not your fault, but not going to help you in any way. Yeah. You took DHEA for a couple of months. It doesn't mean anything. Yeah, it's not going to do a fuck. Not even for a couple of months. Couple of days. Oh, there you go.
*  Couple of days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's no way that's going to give any performance. And I just think I hate paperwork that things. It seems like logical heads would go, oh, clear them. Yeah. Yeah. If you have to suspend it for two months, we get too much. That's not that big a deal. Yeah. Let's get it right back in the hunt. Reschedule a fight. You know, we've got so many big fights coming up after this fear. There's Salt Lake City, which is I think Salt Lake City is going to be Holloway and Ilya to Korea.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then of course, hallway fan here. Yeah. Damn. How about that? Gachie fight? I was there. I was there. It was crazy. The way that, you know, when people do like the wave in crowds, it was this was like the fucking atomic bomb.
*  Boom, dude. And then everyone like last second, you know, like it's crazy because it's like, okay, you're watching this fight and you're like, okay, cool. Yeah. Max got this, you know, in the bag. And then Gachie comes and he's swinging and she's like, oh, okay. It's like everyone's still engaged, right? Because they're fighting. But then like as soon as I hit, boom, insane, the entire arena. I was getting chills just thinking about it. Like being in that moment. That was sick. It was so crazy. Yeah. And Max versus Topori is going to be wild. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's gonna be great. That is a wild fight. Teporia is a fucking savage. Yeah. He's a savage. He's he's so savage. Which brings me to what I was gonna say about Jamal. I'm very sad that he hurt his knee. You know, I certainly want him to get better. But I did not like him taking that fight with you so quickly after getting KO by Pereira. No, no, I don't like guys taking fights real quickly. I mean, I like it for you, but I don't like it for him. I don't think it's smart. I think you feel okay. But I don't think you're okay.
*  And I think that's Volkanovsky after he got KO'd by Islam. And then a couple months later, he fights Ilya and gets knocked unconscious. Yeah, that's real, man. You know, you've been stopped before. You know what it's like. Yeah, it's like you're not quite right for a long time after that. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, man. Like, when it happened, and when they called me and told me that this was the situation, that was a lot of the fans response. And then people that I know, they're like, dude, what's wrong with this guy? Like,
*  honestly, my response to everybody was like, dude, that's none of my business. Right. It's up to him. It's true. You know what I mean? Like, whatever he chooses to do, that's on him. Yep. But I mean, it does, to me, it seems like him. I mean, he seems like someone who's very like, fuck it, headstrong. Oh, yeah. You know, that's him. Definitely. Okay, cool, dude. Do you. I'm going to continue to do me. And then it's really... Look, he might be fine. Yeah. I mean, he got clipped and dropped and then he got beaten up when he was on the ground and he stood right there.
*  Right back up afterwards. Maybe he didn't get a concussion. Maybe he just got dinged. Who knows? But like guys of like Mirko Kropkop in Pride, he fought Kevin Randleman and he got KO'd bad, real bad. And then he fought again 25 days later.
*  What was the result of that one? Who did he fight? Do you remember? I forget. See if you find Mirko's record. But then he eventually fought Randleman again and then choked him. Damn, I miss those. I miss those days.
*  I remember when I first introduced to MMA and seeing Kropkop, those high kicks. Oh my God. And just folding people. Oh my God, bro. Oh my God. Folding people. Folding people to the body. Folding people to the head. Anywhere.
*  So where does it go all the way back? Kevin Randleman. So he loses to Randleman and he fights Ken Ahara and then he fights Oyama and then he fights Alex Emelianenko and then he fights Josh Burnett. And then he gets a rematch with Kevin Randleman.
*  So look at the time. So April of 2004. Holy. April. And then in May. And then he fights in May, a month later. A month later. And then he takes a month break and comes back in July. Yeah, bro. They were fighting. Then they were fighting. Then they were fighting in August, then again in October, then again in December. And then again in February he fights Mark Coleman. Holy shit, man. Oh my God. Those guys were getting after it. Kropkop is Hall of Famer, right? Oh yeah. 100%. 100% Hall of Famer.
*  And back then those guys weren't. They were like the whole thing of pride back then. They didn't get called until like two weeks before the fight. Crazy. No one even knew who was on the card. Didn't even know. No, they all like it was all like everybody just had to train and get ready. Yeah, wasn't it just like the guys were training and then they'd get a call and then it'd say like X amount of money and they're like cool, we'll be there. Yep. And then show up. And a lot of you got paid in cash. In cash, right? Yeah. So they're like yeah, I'll go get that bag. Yeah, and corner men. They were like taping cash bundles to their body. Taping cash. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I did hear stories about that. I heard a lot of stories about that. Man, what a time. It was a wild time. It'd be cool if it were still kind of like that. I know. If they had leagues that were like that, that would be cool. Well, it would be cool if there was an organization that was competing with the UFC at that level. Yeah. Like that pride was at the time. Like Saitama Super Arena. Yeah. That's Saitama Super Arena. I think it's 90,000 people. It was full. Yeah. Full for pride. Crazy. Nuts. And then you know the scandals, the Yakuts.
*  All that stuff and it just kind of goes away. But at one point in time, they were bigger than the UFC. It was huge. Yeah. And it was huge here too. Everybody watched it. Yeah. Especially martial artists. Everybody watched Noguera when he was the champ and Fador when he was going through his prime over there. Yeah. When I got into MMA, I think I watched more pride than I did UFC. And at the time, it wasn't live, right? But like I had to go buy a DVD from Zia Records or something. It's like yeah, of course. I'm going to buy the pride ones. Sometimes it'd be a pride event and you'd have to stay offline because you'd find
*  out the results and they wouldn't air it for a while later. Like days, maybe even weeks later. Yeah. That was before. I wasn't even that deep into the game yet. I was just watching like DVDs and YouTube videos, I think. And they would have them sometimes live and it would be live in America. So you'd have to watch it like four o'clock in the morning. Oh my God. Yeah. Were you one of those guys? Yeah. I had a bunch of guys over. A bunch of guys from Jiu Jitsu came over the house. We all watched it at like four o'clock in the morning. That's pretty sick. Well, speaking of Jiu Jitsu, I'm going to compete in
*  World Masters. Really? When are you doing that? It's the end of August in Vegas. The only thing that makes me nervous about stuff like that is when a guy at your level that's like right there with a shot at the title. Like you're a fight or two away from a potential world championship fight. Yeah. And then you're going to let some dude leg lock you. It's not going to happen. So you say that but. No, no, no. It's not going to happen. I mean like so this is something that I'm trying
*  to just do for myself to like man I've been training like a dog you know and like what belt do you know? I'm purple. So I've been training like a dog. I feel good. Yeah. Yeah. And I just like it's it's not that serious to me. Right. It's not like I'm putting everything on the line to go win this thing. It's like no dude I just I kind of just want to get in there.
*  And. Kaleel you're a savage. Once you get in there you're going to be going. Why are you lying to me? Why are you staring me in the eye? You're a straight up killer. Why are you lying to me? I am a killer but I think I think it's a little bit different when it comes to like going in here and competing with Jiu Jitsu. I think for me the reason why I kind of made this decision is and I mean it all like it's a hundred and seventy something bucks or whatever to register right. Like I could just say at the last minute like.
*  You know I'm not going to do it but I think it's another way for me to get out and like and hang out with the fans dude. Like I have a lot of fans in the Jiu Jitsu community as well. And there are a lot of friends in that community and I go to Worlds every year and hang out there and sometimes I get the itch like man it'd be cool to just you know hop in here and have three matches four matches in a day like whatever. So that's kind of more my approach. I just want to get there kind of connect with the people. Yeah I'll throw my key. I'll compete but.
*  I'm not going to get injured if something's you know if something's if someone's got my leg ankle lock something like that like OK let's maybe I'll tap.
*  It makes me think about Cubs Swanson. Remember Cubs Swanson blew out his ACL in a grappling competition. I didn't know that. Yeah I blew out his ACL and a no-ghee. I think it was no-ghee. And it was you know when it was a couple of years back when Cub was you know doing really well.
*  And for sure it slowed his momentum. Now you're like freaking me out. I mean I thought about it right. The thought of injury came up. I'll tell you right now don't do it. It's not worth it. Come on Joe. Listen you probably will be fine. But if not if not if not then it's another video.
*  I don't know. I don't know what what I don't think you can like inside heel hook. There's there's a bunch of things that the problem is the friction of the ghee. Yeah yeah yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don
*  know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
*  You're going to look at this like Yeah, thang this creates this
*  natural
*  control. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean I'll I'll I'll give it more thought.
*  Like you're gonna push a hundred percent in competition more explosive. Yeah, yeah weird stuff happens. Yeah weird shit happens
*  It's not worth it guys. You're right there. Yeah, you're right there. You're right there
*  I'll say fucking don't I was so sure until I had this conversation with you
*  I can talk you out and doing it please listen imagine you do that you blow out an ACL
*  Yeah, then I'm an idiot. Yeah, it makes no sense for no reason. Ah fuck
*  Worth it, okay, I would not be snowboarding. I would not be doing that's okay. Yeah, no nonsense. Don't fuck around
*  Well, there's no not no reason for nonsense right now. You're right there, dude
*  Damn, you're right there. You guys heard it Joe Rogan just talked me out of thank God. I did
*  You just you gotta listen to me Wow
*  No, but here's the thing like I would hate
*  To have this conversation with you and you'd be so like adamant and passionate about like you don't do it
*  And then something did happen and I well I'd hate to even try now because I put it in your head
*  Now I don't want that to be in your head if you want to do it
*  Maybe I'll talk to you again and try to like you're gonna be fine
*  You're awesome
*  I'm sure you'll be in complete control these guys can't fuck with you what purple belts gonna be able to tap you yeah
*  But I've been trying to stay you know somewhat active
*  It's crazy that you say like snowboarding shit because I picked up skiing
*  Last year oh
*  Yeah, yeah super
*  Natural everything was good of course
*  But thankfully I picked it up at the end of the winter so I only got like three months in but I did hit some
*  black diamond runs in Whistler
*  One that was like the what the guy told me is like oh, this is the one that they did in the Olympics
*  And I was like okay cool. I'll try it
*  I did really well
*  but outside of that I mean I
*  Play a lot of golf dude well golf is a good one
*  Yeah, now I'm gonna get hurt doing not gonna get her doing that so I'll just stick to that fucking Trump
*  He's 80 years old. He's out there playing golf. What a maniac yeah
*  How the hell is this guy yeah, yeah
*  That's actually one thing that I that I found out about skiing too because like here's the thing
*  Yeah skiing anything like that can be dangerous, but when I was out there
*  I didn't see anybody over the age of 40 on a snowboard right, but I saw guys 80 years old
*  So my father-in-law skiing yeah, you know and I'm like okay. I want to pick up things that I can do for a long time
*  I want to be active now like ever since I made the change and became a fighter and all these things of my life's changed
*  And I want to stay active
*  I think that's very important to like stay active as long as you can and so I picked up some hobbies because I am an
*  extreme guy
*  Skiing can be an extreme sport. Yeah, you know
*  You know it can also be very chill so things like golf and skiing have been kind of I stopped skiing a couple years ago
*  Because I I wiped out bad and it was not my fault
*  I was going around a turn and this lady
*  Didn't know how to ski and she was kind of like sliding into the trail and I had two decisions either
*  plow right into her and fuck this lady up or fall and I chose to fall and
*  I didn't have much control over how I felt because it was like at the edge of the turn and I
*  Slammed my head the back of my head bad
*  Definitely got a concussion, but also broke the top of my leg. It's called an insufficiency fracture, okay
*  It's where the top of your shin hits your cartilage. Okay. It's still fucks with me to this day and
*  Top of your shin yeah, there's a crack at the top of my shin okay at the top of my tibia
*  Oh, that's where I broke my leg. That's why I broke my knee same spot
*  Yeah, right mine was not bad. It was just a crack, but I went to the doctor. I'm like man something's wrong
*  It's just like it's not this is this feels fucked up. Yeah did the x-ray and everything
*  Oh, you have a crack shit or a crack in your bone. Yeah, there's nothing they could do about it
*  They said it'll be okay in six weeks, but I'm like fuck skiing
*  I'm yeah, and I was like the rest of the day I was out of it
*  I could try to get on the ski lift and I fell because I was so dizzy
*  I tried to get like I try to get up and I had a hard time getting back up
*  Help me up like an old man. I couldn't get up
*  I was like I was I I hit my head hard because I remember when my head hit when I heard the bang
*  Of my head hit the the the pack snow. It was like icy snow. I remember thinking oh, that's a concussion
*  Yeah, right away. I said you can feel it. That's a real concussion
*  Yeah, if you've taken blows to the head before and things of that you can feel like yeah
*  That was like harder than I think I've ever been kicked in the head. Yeah, it was bang
*  It's like oh fuck man, and I was just dizzy the whole day
*  I was thinking about going to the doctor for that, but I'm like let me just see
*  With life yeah, you know what they would do for me other than hospitalize me and monitor me
*  Yeah, but I know I knew I got rocked
*  How has how has your training been going? What's been what you've been doing?
*  well
*  I still like I said my knee still fucks with me and so that's kept me from doing jujitsu because it's just I
*  Don't want to get injured
*  You know I'm 56 and as you get older injuries take fucking forever to come back from and I've had a couple of problems with
*  This knee I had surgery on it and then of what time I I I fucked up my MCL
*  About when I was about to get on stage
*  so I was doing these shows with Dave Chappelle at stubs, which is in town during the pandemic and
*  They're bringing me up to stage
*  And I'm turning the recorder on on my phone as I'm walking up these cement stairs
*  And I wasn't paying attention because the stairs kind of turn and I
*  Stubbed like the top of my foot as I was like stepping up, and I kind of heel hooked myself
*  And like hard
*  Painful yeah, I went on stage and my leg was shaking from the pain
*  And it looked like I was terrified to be up there
*  So nervous the show went great people probably didn't even notice if they didn't weren't in the front row and see my leg
*  Shaking yeah, but so you got this Netflix special thing coming up. Yeah, that's already no you're gonna live. It's live
*  It's live Saturday night, dude. I'm like
*  Where do I find it on Netflix? It'll be on Netflix Saturday night. Yeah, I'm excited to see that
*  It's gonna be fun. I was actually kind of looking at some stuff like knowing you know like a few weeks months a month in advance
*  I'd be here. I'm like I want to see some something Joe Rogan's like comedy shit
*  But I couldn't find a lot of like recent stuff some of it online today
*  I have a clip that Netflix sent today
*  Then I'll put online
*  But I haven't done a special in six years because I was supposed to do a special right when the pandemic broke out
*  Okay, so the pandemic broke out in March
*  And I was gonna do a special in August and then everything just shut down
*  I was like what the fuck and so and then I just came here moved
*  Bought a club started to build in my own club. Oh, yeah this
*  Saturday 9 o'clock
*  Saturday 9 o'clock Texas time 7 o'clock, Nevada time. Okay, we're gonna have a watch party at my house should be fun
*  Yeah, I'm gonna have some friends over. I'll be cool, man. I'm excited for it. Yeah, I've been liking
*  I've been liking comedy a little bit more lately like it's a good relief for a fighter
*  Yeah, I'm like I'm such a like serious guy that fucking sensitive and serious
*  You know, I take everything in the heart, but I've noticed that like just
*  Opening up and like watching other guys do stand-up and stuff
*  It's really fun like just having just being able to laugh about certain shit right cool, you know, yeah
*  Yeah, actually after I after all this shit happened one of the first things I did Ronnie Chang invited me out to a show
*  Oh, yeah, he was in town
*  He does jujitsu, I don't know if you know that no, yeah, how long has he been doing it a few years now
*  I think he's a
*  Blue belt blue a purple belt pretty good
*  We trained at the PI we rolled
*  Super cool had some good rounds. He filmed like this little thing that never got released. But yeah, that same same day
*  He's like, hey, I'm having a show tonight in Vegas at the Venetian
*  Like come by I'd love to have you and I went and so cool. That's so funny. Yeah, sure
*  Ronnie's a good dude, man. Yeah, very very funny guy. I love his angry comedy. Yeah
*  It's so good angry at everybody being so stupid so stupid
*  He's like his napkins part
*  Like he was like saying something about Americans like just always so many fucking napkins napkins and like screens screens. Oh, it's funny
*  It's very relevant. Yeah. Yeah, he's a smart dude
*  It's a good time for comedy, you know, because also whenever the world is about to be on fire
*  I don't know what everything's going crazy everywhere. You look it's a good time for comedy because there's so much shit to talk about
*  Yeah
*  Damn so now I'm not gonna do jujitsu don't do it tournament. Please don't do it. I wouldn't ski either
*  I'll tell you don't ski you're just too close
*  Yeah, you're too close you too close to like one of the most important things that a combat sports athlete could ever possibly achieve
*  You're so close
*  Like the UFC champion is the greatest fighter on earth
*  It's there's no if-ands-or-buts about it in that weight class the UFC champion is the greatest fighter on work
*  The only thing that you can contest that is with okay one FC has some elite fighters Bellator has some elite fighters
*  PFL has some lead fighters. There's there's guys out there that are really elite
*  They just so happen to have been signed by or other organizations. Yeah, but MMA fighters at a championship level
*  You know ultimately are the best fighters on earth. Yeah, and you're that close. Yeah. Yeah, so just stay yeah stay
*  So keep training man. Keep training keep training. Stay focused keep improving, you know, every time I see you you're better
*  Yeah, it's obvious that you I remember when you came back from Thailand you fought Eric Anders. Yeah. Yeah, you love that one
*  I love it
*  I love it cuz when you bring me up on other podcasts and you talk about that I'm like fuck
*  Yeah, he still remembers our dude because I'd seen you fight before and I knew you were good, but there was like something happen
*  It's like what the fuck happened like this is just
*  Monumental, you know you see like numbers like you you're you went up like 30% or something crazy
*  Yeah, and then even in that fight, yeah, there was like 75 low kicks landed like things like that
*  It was just smoothness to it to us. There's a technique it changed me dude. Yeah, like I mean we talked about it
*  Yeah, Thailand was like one of the best things for me and like my heart is still there. There's still a huge connection
*  Do you go back? I would I did what I went back after the Smith fight, but I went back for just pure like
*  Let me just get re tapped in and then I went there and then that's where Mia and I we got married there
*  Like here we had a Thai ceremony. It was really cool. That's cool. Yeah, so we just kind of like I
*  Hadn't been back since the pandemic so we went back and just I needed it
*  You know cuz I've been focused and just training right back home cuz it feels more home
*  That's why than anywhere else a lot of people move there just cuz so have you seen it. I mean everybody's there now, man
*  Yeah
*  everybody's there now so
*  Yeah, it's it's been cool. I've I still stay active in in that area home
*  I've been working on some new stuff. I'm very excited for whenever I do fight again
*  Because I know it's just I know it's a better version of me man
*  like I don't know as it maybe it's like as I get older and just like I guess where I'm at in my life and
*  The mental shift that I've made towards training and the dedication you've had some moments in the past
*  We weren't like fully locked in yeah, and then but you've always come back from those and been locked in in the next fight
*  Yeah, you know so I think now you realize like hey, this is it. This is the push for glory
*  I think one I don't know if a lot of people realize this but I've
*  I've pretty much spent my entire career in the UFC when I got into the ultimate fighter. I had three professional fights
*  That's crazy. Yeah, dude. I got in the ultimate fighter 3-0. I
*  Had all my fights in the RFA in the beginning LFA now
*  at middleweight and
*  Then ultimate fighter light heavyweight season comes up and I'm like, okay, I'll try out I can make the weight
*  Made it then
*  Got the contract so all of my fights besides the first three have been in the UFC
*  So like yeah, there's been some crazy like ups and downs, but I feel like now I'm at a point where yeah
*  I've got a crazy place to develop
*  Crazy place to do so many guys are coming in now the UFC like 21 by 21 fights 15 to know
*  You know like they've they've built, you know
*  They've kind of built their style and they've gone through all the adversity before then they get to the big show
*  it's like no right in a way like I was kind of born in the big show and
*  You know like as soon as I as soon as I got into it Dana was hyped because of my ultimate fighter
*  Performances, so he starts throwing me on like main cards me, you know, right, right? I'm on the big show
*  I'm fighting in arenas already all the shit and then the go can go Kansaki fight and then you know
*  A huge yeah, dude. So that was a huge one. Yes, I'll come out so much hype coming in
*  He had so much, you know glory champion k1. Yeah, go Khan was a legend
*  yeah, so it's it's been kind of cool to finally get to that spot where like I
*  Feel good, you know, like I feel good. I'm confident what I what I can do now. I know exactly where I'm going
*  I'm not like one foot in one foot out
*  And you know, I got one thing that I'm focused on and that's being champion
*  Well the work showed in the Anthony Smith fight it really did I mean that this
*  This trajectory that you're on showed that you're you're on a new level. Yeah, dude
*  new level
*  For sure and
*  You know one thing that it's kind of crazy that helped me for
*  The preparation of that fight because he took it last man Tim ten days notice. I was scheduled to fight another guy
*  he got pneumonia like kind of the week week before something like that, but
*  I did a lot of shooting for that uh
*  for that camp I
*  Went shooting and that changed my perspective because I'm not a guns guy. Oh, it's like shooting in a ray
*  Yeah, and it changed it just changed a lot in what way
*  You know what we were talking about earlier how like like brilliance and like physical ability and like mental
*  Yeah
*  I'd never I was never a gun guy like my dad was murdered so like from a young age
*  I just kind of had this like weird relationship with guns
*  And yeah, I've had guns
*  Yeah, whatever pulled on me blah blah, but
*  when I made that decision to go and like actually
*  Learn from a guy who was
*  Navy SEAL
*  Had a lot of expertise had a really good way of like we spent hours of him
*  Just explaining to me certain things, you know gun safety blah blah different situations
*  His mentality clearing buildings blah blah blah
*  so I'm taking all this in all this information and processing it all and then I finally start to shoot and
*  The power that I felt from the gun, you know, just like the the
*  Accuracy that I felt from shooting an AR-15 the understanding of like different caliber of bullets
*  Made me start to then formulate how I'm going to strike like, you know like
*  Man I'm giving away secrets fuck it. So
*  Even on the act like the Anthony Smith fight like my left hand. I'm like, okay, my left hand is five five six
*  That's the ammunition for fucking you know, they are for AR so like that's how I was kind of processing everything
*  So every time I threw my left hand I'm thinking of the sound and the feeling of the AR real
*  Bum, you know, like yeah, so I'm like, okay like
*  Feeling the target whatever just kind of like okay. What do I feel like fucking loading? Okay load it. You know, like I'm just
*  Thinking about every time I shot the gun every time I shot the pistol. It's like I was like
*  Yeah
*  so like it was it it really like I was able to kind of pull from that experience and then
*  Bring it into my fight. But then also not only that
*  I was also thinking about like the things that this guy was telling me when it came to like when they're in combat when they're
*  Clearing buildings and so like just emotionally it's so crazy dude before that fight
*  My my strength and conditioning coach Lorenzo. He's a big big shooter guy
*  ex-military, you know, but
*  big big on shooting big on self-defense and
*  The day of the fight, you know
*  Like I'm obviously just in the zone and I'm sitting in the living room because I stay with him during camps
*  We just do it that way
*  Kind of just shaking back and forth because I have so much energy and he knows that I've been
*  Putting in my experiences from shooting into my training and it's crazy
*  I was sitting there dude, and I have my hood on to inside and I'm just like rocking back and forth and he comes
*  And he just fucking sets an AR-15 right there on my lap. Oh, wow walks away
*  Just rocking back and forth
*  You
*  Know and then we we drive to the apex from the house and then Wow like so the whole the other whole time and in
*  My head even as we're walking out. He's like five five six five five six and I'm like
*  And then in the first round he's like five five six and I was just I kept saying that in my head
*  Wow just fucking dude, it was crazy
*  That's an interesting visualization tool because you think about it
*  Like that's really how you want your strikes to land you want them to be almost instantaneous from the time you
*  Pull the trigger from the time you pull a trigger. Yeah, yeah, and you like what's your right hand?
*  Right hand was
*  Wasn't even my weapon it was like I wasn't looking at it like that. It was kind of more like range really
*  Yeah rangefinder, but I'd say like
*  I'd say that
*  When I did throw the jab it was probably
*  Everything for that like was five five six. So even my jab, I threw some pretty clean jabs in there
*  Yeah
*  But I wanted it to land straight accurate and like fast and so it wasn't like, you know shotgun
*  I'm thinking of the sound the reaction precision precision instantaneous
*  Instantaneous. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like not a lot of recoil right like pop
*  Yeah
*  Sting sting like just like that. That's interesting to visualize it that way
*  You know because you know
*  You sometimes you see guys throwing punches at a lower level and you see them like grit
*  Swing and everything's wide and yeah hoping it lands. Yeah
*  No, I was very intentional with every every movement every strike in that fight
*  So far that's my favorite one before that it was Eric Anders because it was like oh got to do some way tie
*  This one I still got to throw some you know
*  Tie style type of stuff as soon as like my posture kind of relaxed
*  I remember one of the commentators like oh here comes the time, you know, okay, so that was cool
*  but I think
*  The you know the weapon kind of mentality for me was was nice. That's interesting
*  That's a great way to think about it. Really, you know, yeah
*  It's a great way to visualize like the instantaneous response. Yeah, but that's me dude every time
*  every fight something different like I
*  That's the art side of me for martial arts, you know, that's how I'm able to stay in this
*  That's how I'm able to grow. It's it's more than fighting. It's more than ego. It's more than my dicks bigger than yours
*  You know, like I don't like that to me that shit
*  Fuck it
*  like that's why it's kind of hard for me to to like position myself in the right way and like build the fan base and
*  Like have the income and stuff like that. I think like that could potentially have right
*  I'm more of an artist because I'm using you know, I need it like right naturally an artist
*  So I like I need to find ways to like how do I express this?
*  so every fights different because I'm just trying to find a different way to express myself and like what I'm going through and
*  How I'm feeling you don't even comes out in fights art
*  Really? It is the right term when people call it martial arts and you know people that arguments like that's not an art
*  It's an art to people who understand it because when you watch a person land a beautiful combination, that's artwork. Yeah, that's like
*  Yeah, oh it's pretty yeah, you know you watch someone land something good. It's like that's pretty
*  Yeah, you know and I don't I
*  Don't see a lot of it as much anymore. I think that's why I haven't I've been watching fights for different reasons nowadays
*  You know, like I'm watching light heavyweights fight watching heavyweights fight
*  and
*  I'm just trying to see like okay, what's kind of the common theme?
*  What's everybody kind of working on but that's why I used to like to watch
*  You know Anderson and leoto and all these guys because it was just a different time
*  They were bringing this kind of like fresh new look and yes, you know this different thing well Anderson particularly he was an artist
*  Oh, yeah, like when you land that front kick to V tors face like does piece beautiful piece of art beautiful
*  And it's just the timing involved in that and then just expression
*  Just landing it setting it up. Yeah, have you thought about going to middleweight?
*  I have we walk around at well, I mean
*  right now like
*  Under 230 over 220 over 220 so I'm like I float in between the 220 so you're not an enormous light heavyweight
*  No, no, no, I'm probably one of the shorter ones
*  Yeah for sure and I thought about middleweight
*  But like I've done that dexa scan thing at the PI and my body with like just dense like no water just bone and
*  Bone and muscles 186. Oh god, so you gotta get to death's door
*  Yeah, so I've done it like the beginning of my career and in amateur days
*  I did fight at 185, but it was it was hell and so now like yeah, I like to eat man
*  Yeah, and obviously you're doing great. Yeah, and I like to train. I think there should be way more weight classes
*  I really really do. I think this should be one every 10 pounds
*  Yeah, minimum that'd be nice. Look at boxing. Yeah, there's a reason why there's a 147 and 154 and 160
*  It's because there really is a difference gene a legitimate in their prime
*  154 and 160. Yeah for sure. It's just that's how it should be then when you get a gap like 85 to 205
*  That's crazy. That's too big. Yeah, it's a big guy. That's a really big guy big
*  Yeah, and then another 25 pounds
*  You know 205 to 265 is nuts. I should wait cuttings. It's trash, dude. I don't like it
*  I don't I still like okay, so I'm well I walk around to 22 30 blah blah
*  But I still don't necessarily cut weight like I make sure that I gradually go down. I keep my
*  Food consumption the same all the way through camp really the only thing that changes is my intensity goes up
*  Which causes my weight to go down? Oh
*  So I said this is perfect I sit in the sauna 30 minutes maximum oh that's great to lose it one pound so that's why
*  You're so
*  Physically from perfect when you're fighting. Yeah, dude
*  I don't yeah, and that's why I like I'm five rounds for me like I feel like it's gonna be nothing
*  Because I train year round at the weight when I rehydrate
*  I'm back up to 225 blah blah where I'm used to carrying my weight, right?
*  So when I'm doing all my drills
*  When I'm running and when I'm jumping and when I'm doing all of the stuff that I'm doing to get better physically that same
*  Person is the same person that's stepping in the cage. I hate the idea of like
*  expecting yourself to perform at the highest level but for the last two weeks or something like you're depleting and then the last day before you
*  expect to
*  Be at the height of physical performance. You're dehydrating your body and your brain and everything of
*  Everything that does it doesn't make sense to me. It should know legal it should be I
*  Honestly, like I don't fuck with cutting weight. It's just it that's great. You know, like I just don't I don't like it
*  I don't think that it gives anybody the advantage
*  I really don't like a guy who's you know, I'm gonna cut down to what 155 like what do you walk around 190?
*  You're fucking stupid, you know like it
*  Yeah, you're gonna be the bigger guy who cares like you know what I mean?
*  You're also gonna not be able to take shots as well
*  I'm gonna be able to take shots as well long term
*  Like if you really want to do this if you really want to be that doing this long term
*  It's not gonna be good for you. You know what I mean?
*  I can only imagine that like at like a smaller level like or like at a deeper level
*  It's probably bad for your body. Do you think there's a reasonable way to stop weight cutting?
*  Is when WME bought the UFC?
*  Conversation with Ari and I told him you know what I would do is like this is what I would do if I was running
*  The show I'd get rid of weight cutting I'd figure out a way
*  He's like how would you do with the weight class like a blow him up blow him up
*  The stars are the most important thing anyway
*  No one's gonna give a fuck of Alex Pettit is the champion at 225 or 210 or 205. No one gives a fuck
*  Yeah, he's the champion, right? We all know he's the champion. So let's find out what he actually weighs
*  What do you weigh when you're healthy?
*  What do you weigh when you're healthy and lean like you do when you get down to 206 or 207 when right before you cut the
*  Last pound or two of weight. What do you weigh? Let's find that out and that's what you should be fighting at
*  We should have adequate weight classes
*  So that like you don't have an elite fighter
*  That's starving himself to get to a lower weight class because he's really not big enough to compete at the 20 pounds above weight class
*  Yeah, and this is I know that one instituted some sort of hydration testing. That's the bullshit
*  What do you hear about it?
*  So I don't I can't I can't give like an educated like I don't have all the facts right now
*  But from what I've heard is that like it's from the fighters that I have like friends in one
*  They just say like it's bullshit and there's also like ways around it
*  like they can
*  for instance like
*  they test your the hydration right and you're in your urine to be able to be like, okay if you're if
*  If we detect that you're dehydrated and that proves that you're cutting weight, but a lot of these guys will
*  Dehydrate they'll cut weight and then they'll chug a bunch of water and just hold their piss. Mmm, you get what I mean?
*  So like just so that one whatever I don't know. It's really weird, but it doesn't seem to really some shenanigans
*  There's some shenanigans
*  I think that one thing that people that they could do as far as this weight cutting thing just how they randomly test us
*  We don't know when you saw this coming or we don't know when the anti-doping is coming
*  Weigh us too. Yes, and we have to be in between
*  Mm-hmm X amount give us like a 10 pound allowance, right? You know what I mean?
*  So it's not like you fight at 155
*  But when we came and tested you your 190 when Alex fought Izzy he weighed in at 85
*  Yeah, and then he made it into the cage at 226 to 26. Yeah, no, yeah nuts, which is it's crazy
*  That's like 40 pounds. That's so much depletion. That's so crazy. So crazy. That's so crazy
*  I mean like yeah, he gained a lot of weight but also like how much let's look at the other side of that
*  How much did he deplete?
*  The day before he's supposed to fight Israel out of Sonia the heavyweight or the middleweight fucking champion
*  And when Izzy knocked him out, maybe that had a factor
*  I'm almost positive that a lot of these knockouts and shit do happen from weight cuts. I think so
*  I think so too
*  Yeah
*  and then like our ability to go X amount of rounds blah blah blah like I think that it all plays a factor man, especially
*  With the inability to use IVs
*  Yeah, because they say that the brain takes the longest time to rehydrate you rehydrate your body in 24 hours
*  But your brain takes like 48. Yeah, they do a good job at like giving us all the stuff
*  You know like all these liquids and things like that
*  Like they do their job the UFC always does their job, but there can be there can be some type of change made
*  Hopefully there is you know, no one is thinking about it at all. There's no attempts at all to do it culture
*  Yeah, that's just like people are just okay. This is what we do. Yeah the culture
*  I mean it's happened that way for so long that they just have this in their head. Yeah, why would they change it?
*  Yeah, I just think there's a lot of things that could be done differently
*  And I think the hydration thing is a real big one
*  I think that's a that's a giant one because it does it's it's so bad for the performance of the athletes because it's gonna weaken
*  You 100% yeah, even if you victorious you look awesome
*  You look less awesome than you would look if you didn't have to dehydrate yourself 24 hours ago. Mm-hmm
*  Period yeah, also more dangerous also kidney problems organs shut down and the instances that I know that people have died from MMA
*  There was one in Russia where a guy died from a fight that apparently he had like some sort of a pre-existing condition
*  But I know at least two guys who died in Brazil from weight cutting Wow
*  Yeah, we see it right these we see these guys
*  I have to pull out the night before or whatever because they are the day of yeah
*  I think a lot of it is because of the way cuts speaking hydration try this man. What's this?
*  My drink kill cliff kill octane CBD. Oh, I have to read the ingredients
*  It's legit it's good that's this is your cherry yeah your company
*  Yeah, Mike well, I'm one of the owners of the company, but this one I came up with me and my friend cam
*  This one's called elk blood spicy cherry. It's good
*  But this is all cheers. This is all
*  legit clean ingredients
*  And
*  Cvd that's sweet right no not too sweet at all spice to it
*  Yeah, I think that's great if the UFC was gonna do anything differently
*  That would be the first one that I would say the second one that I would say pay structure pay structure for sure
*  I knew I heard you talk about that before they should be getting more money or not also
*  I don't like the wind bonus. That's that's what I meant. That's what I meant like I think
*  I think the wind bonus thing is like I
*  Hate it. It does suck. I did hear you talk about that. I forgot what episode
*  I think it was with Francis. Yeah, yeah, I I agree man. It's it's pretty rough
*  You know like especially with bad decision. Yeah, it sucks like bad decisions, and then like you get half your money crazy half
*  Yeah, crazy
*  Especially split decision half that's nuts. Yeah, I'd you know like
*  I'm I'm grateful whatever for you know what I make but I do think that it'd be a lot nicer to just
*  Not have to
*  Pay or you know fight for win and show the other thing that they need to do and I really think this could be done
*  Cover the tips of the fingers. Yeah, there's no reason why these fingers need to be exposed
*  Okay, so I've been testing I it's been pretty cool
*  I've been the guy testing all of the new gloves like with the with ember from the UFC
*  One of the slight changes that they've made is the padding in the glove provides a little bit more curvature towards the fingers
*  But yes covering the fingers I think would be something that
*  Would prevent all the eye pokes. That's one of I think the eye poke right now is probably the scariest thing in
*  MMA yeah getting poked in the eye. I'm blind. I got poked the last camp actually preparing for
*  for Jamal Hill and like it
*  Cut the entire I like top eyelid, and I was like this is the scariest shit ever
*  Yeah, I think that should definitely be it's
*  But it's not gonna happen anytime soon because all these new gloves like production. I don't get it
*  Yeah, when they said they were gonna have new good
*  They seem real similar to me Trevor Whitman in my opinion has the best gloves who the onyx yeah
*  I mean they're the best MMA gloves and they had some sort of
*  There was some negotiation with Trevor
*  But he wanted more money than they were willing to give apparently there's a lot of money
*  I don't know, but I think it should be different than that even I think it should be like the Trevor Whitman gloves
*  But where the fingertips are I think you cover it with just a piece of leather just a leather
*  Yeah, yeah with like a little sliver you can just yeah, yeah, so it goes you can still grapple
*  Yeah, you just can't spread the fingers exactly. Why would you say the finger like mittens exactly?
*  Yeah, you just it's a piece of leather yeah, so if you wanted to hit someone with their knuckles
*  Then you still have to worry about the thumb yeah
*  But that's gonna cut down think about the percentage that will cut down on finger pokes
*  Yeah, because a lot of them are this yeah, right we see very we don't see a lot of them
*  So if it's this but if it has that then it's not gonna go in the eye if it's a cover and the cover like you
*  Never grapple like this. You never close your fingers together ever so what what would it prevent in grappling nothing?
*  What would it prevent and striking nothing, but it would prevent eye pokes. Yeah, it seems like a pretty clear solution
*  Yeah, I it's just crazy like like anything right there's just a lot of like
*  Just like politics, and yeah, I think that that is one of the things that could have been changed
*  I don't know why or who at the round table is like
*  Yeah, I don't know either. We've heard all the time. We know that eye poking is a thing
*  But let's make the same glove and just do it. You know a little bit differently well. It's better everybody says it's better
*  Yeah, it's not lighter. It's not perfect. Is it light how much lighter it's?
*  3.5 oh half ounce yeah half ounce lighter
*  Wrist is a little bit different like the straps different
*  the inside of the knuckle part here is
*  Padded now so like if you do throw like a right. It's like it kind of makes me want to
*  Punch like knife style
*  Right your hands more protected yeah hands more protected
*  You can feel the half ounce or like the you can feel that really you can feel the difference. I can't at least
*  That's crazy. Yeah, so um
*  Yeah, it's it's I mean
*  It's a decent glove the only thing that we kind of had some issues with in the beginning if you guys saw on the mock
*  Chev fight the logo was coming off. Oh really interesting so I've been testing that and kind of just doing
*  Round after round of just like in the cage. You know rubbing it on the canvas rubbing on the cage
*  You know getting it wet Vaseline whatever to just make sure that these logos don't come off cuz that we can't have that right right right and
*  That's um
*  Huh?
*  Yeah, yeah
*  But they look cool. Yeah, ones look cool the gold ones are the world title ones are gonna be really cool
*  Yeah, but the gold ones the gold ones are cool. Oh the gold ones are so cool
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, nice. Yeah, it is. That's the new that's the new you'll see the contender one the baby blue. Yeah, that's pretty sick
*  It reminds me of the pride when they had the blue blue gloves pride gloves are great
*  Yeah pride gloves also curved more. Yeah, they curved more and you saw very few eye pokes in pride. Yeah
*  Something with the eye he's something yeah, they were good. They were good gloves
*  But we'll see man. We'll see you know
*  Hopefully probably five years five more years, but I
*  Don't know how long it took them to change the glove. I know it took a long time
*  I don't think they're gonna do anything different honestly
*  I think it's gonna keep it this way, but I mean how many fights get stopped because I pokes
*  I mean look the rematch with Balaam Mahamud and Leon Edwards they had to have a rematch because
*  Belong on I poke yeah first fight cat hooked real bad
*  You know one thing that I did want to mention too is I had this discussion with a friend
*  You know when these
*  Remember like the drew Dover fight and that cut yeah
*  There was a fight before to like some guy like that
*  I was just like hanging like your eyebrow was just hanging by a thread one thing that would be cool is
*  When these moments happen and when this doc when these doctors come in to check
*  Obviously as fighters we're gonna want to keep going most of us. Mm-hmm
*  We got our win and show money. We need that shit. We need that money, right?
*  But it'd be nice if they like brought, you know
*  Coach as well to be able to kind of help call the shots. Not just the doctor
*  you know what I mean, like hmm, I think that
*  Having coaches in your corner is a very important thing for many reasons, right?
*  They kind of keep us in line give us advice what we're doing things that they see but I
*  Think there are times man where like some people should have that coach that's like dude enough, right?
*  Right enough, right? Especially if you care about the longevity of the fighter
*  I don't think that there's enough coaches
*  in the sport that are
*  like showing this kind of level of
*  Like care or concern for their fighters one thing that I appreciate about my coaches in my corner is like dude when you're done with
*  This we don't want you slurring. We don't want you fucking drooling, right?
*  You know, we don't want you limping right like you got to get out of like you got to be done with this
*  Healthy so that you can continue to live a normal life, right?
*  This isn't the only thing you know, and I'm like, wow, that's a good perspective
*  So like when you're done, you're in your 40s. Yeah, and then you have yeah if you're lucky you got 60 more years of life
*  Yeah, keep your teeth keep you know, it doesn't have to be that way. You know, you don't have to be this
*  fucking barbarian, right
*  so I think that like for instance like
*  If I had a cut like that, obviously, I'm gonna want to keep going but that's a bad fucking cut
*  That's like moments away from like your eyes going to be exposed if you get punched one more time, right?
*  Depending on your opponent
*  So like having so having like another person kind of be able to come in and tell the fighter like dude, it's over
*  It's over. Yeah, because we care about you and yeah, you need your money and like yeah, but like let me make this call
*  Yeah, not
*  The doctor or you know what I mean or the coach can be like hey like
*  There's a minute left there blah blah blah tell the doctor we fucking got this
*  You know what I mean? Like allow the coach to come in at that moment, too
*  I think it would be like that makes sense, but they're not medical professionals and there's a lot of lines that you know
*  Yeah, well, it's also you go different athletic commissions have different standards, right?
*  New York is notoriously rough. They stop things quicker and they they stop weight cuts quicker
*  You know, New York has had a bunch of different issues with people cutting weight. That's where Homs on when Hums on
*  Missed weight by eight pounds. They stopped him from cutting. Oh, is it the commission was that New York?
*  I don't know if that was New York. New York was definitely
*  Max Holloway when Max Holloway was supposed to fight Khabib and
*  I think the last minute they pulled him out of the weight cut and they said you can't do it because Max
*  Wasn't supposed to be fighting at all. That was when Tony Ferguson blew his knee out. Okay. Yeah. Yeah
*  Damn, I didn't know it was the Commission that that like made that decision
*  Yes, the Commission made it the city but that was the early days of the UFC being in Madison Square Garden as well
*  Okay, it was you know, you know, you got to realize New York was so fucking corrupt
*  Yeah kept MMA out of New York forever forever and then the guy who kept it out when I'm going to jail for corruption
*  I
*  Crazy but yeah that that was a weight cut issue max was supposed to be fighting Khabib Wow
*  Yeah, which would have been why you'll oh my god
*  Yeah, especially now watching max now and max is another one like people because max lost to
*  Volkanovsky, you know people just sort of wrote Max off and said oh max passes prime like nope
*  Yeah, nope max better than ever
*  fight, how do you do you think that we as UFC fighters should be able to like
*  Fight in like more like boxing or Muay Thai type shit like outside of the UFC. Well
*  It depends
*  You know if it's a guy like you I would say no
*  You're too close
*  Okay, but if it's a guy who is like coming up in the UFC and he gets a you know
*  You're only fighting him once every six months anyway
*  Yeah, and he gets a possible Muay Thai fight if that guy blows his knee out or that's on him
*  Yeah, you know, that's his decision if he wants to stay active and do these other things as well. Sure
*  But once you become like super close
*  So and also super valuable like you're a star now and in the UFC
*  There's only a few guys like you that are not just stars but win in spectacular fashion, right?
*  That's like I'd be like no
*  And look what it did a Connor I get
*  Completely derailed Connors career. Sure. He made a hundred million dollars fighting Floyd Mayer there. Sure sure made him a huge star
*  I'm sure he would do it all over again if he could do it again
*  But the reality is you go back to the Connor that beat Eddie Alvarez that the Connor it mean that Connor Connor mother
*  Yeah, it was a motherfucker. I wish we had that guy still man. I watched that that uh finishing combination
*  Again today Eddie Alvarez. Yeah, we're to Eddie's punch commotion. Did you watch it?
*  It's the fucking algorithm Eddie. He Connors got his eyes wide wide open
*  Look look look look look at the punch comes to his nose and nose and look at me counter this counter so nice
*  Oh my god right behind the ear. It's a perfect counter. It just rocks Eddie the time that he didn't even break eye contact
*  He's still looking at it. And then the right hook look at this bong
*  Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Yeah, I
*  So crazy that that got fed to me on my way here. Yeah
*  Been going around today. Yeah, Prime McGregor was so smooth. Look at that. I'm even smoothing now
*  He says yeah, I wish that was true. Yeah, same dude damn
*  I was true, but I mean maybe he is maybe is and we just need to see him fight again
*  You know, it's been a couple of years
*  I really hope so. I'd love to be able to still get the feeling of seeing Connor do amazing shit
*  You know, and by the way, I fully support him pulling out of that fight. Yeah
*  Yeah, don't fight with a broken toe. No, that's crazy. Like people say toe like whatever it's people
*  They're gonna talk their shit
*  But like did you stub your toe and you're crying about it for five minutes?
*  So imagine having a broken toe exactly, you know, like it's not yeah
*  And meanwhile when Alex fought Jamal apparently he had a broken toe. What was it broken broken or was broken broken?
*  Really? He had a broken pinky toe going into that fight it going into it. Yeah, I mean well
*  Shama
*  Shama hey, I mean a
*  Shama
*  He's ready to go. Yeah
*  Yeah, oh my god. See the guy that you think about when you train. Yeah
*  100% it's like I never okay when I started this when I started MMA I had a dream
*  I had a dream of
*  meeting Anderson Sova and that dream came true
*  like I I
*  Just had a feeling I had a dream. I'm like man. I want to meet this guy. I would fight this guy something
*  I just want to be involved with this guy met him lived with him was in his wedding
*  You know like all that stuff and like okay cool
*  And since then I haven't had real like a dream like a vivid dream until I started seeing
*  But hey don't come into the light heavyweight division and you know all these things and like now yeah
*  I have a dream and like my dream is to put on like a very very memorable fight against this guy like
*  Something that like no matter what the fans are gonna fucking love it. It's gonna be memorable
*  It's gonna hopefully go down in the Hall of Fame one day, you know like
*  Something like that, you know, like yeah, so yeah, it's the guy that I think about at the moment and you know, and my motivation
*  To train and to get better and to be a better person
*  To be a better man. It's like I'm fucking grateful for the guy in a way, you know
*  I mean like it's not a thing. It's more of like fuck. Yeah. Thank you for giving me something to like wake up for every morning
*  Yeah, right for being so dominant. Yeah, that is the thing about when you have an incredible champion
*  It really does make everyone inspired it makes people rise. Yeah
*  Makes your skills have you ever watched by Toph fight in in glory? No
*  Artem Vahitov is the last guy to beat
*  To beat Alex in glory. Uh-huh, and he's nasty. He's his Russian kickboxer. He's really really fucking good
*  Yeah, super tactical those kickboxes are crazy. Yeah. Yeah glories. It's glory is the most
*  in my opinion, it's the most
*  Underrated and under appreciated of all the combat sports because the level that those guys are fighting at is so high
*  Yeah
*  I remember when I listened to you when your episode with with in Ghana when you were talking about Cedric Dumba
*  Yeah, I mean I trained with him a little bit when I was living in Europe and I walked into this gym Joe
*  I'm not even lying dude. I probably trained there twice and I was like I can't I'm not fucking built for this
*  At that time like I'm still young like this was I think it was
*  Could have been it was around the go kansaki fight maybe before or after but I walked into this gym in Belgium and
*  It was just full of dogs and Cedric was there and he was training and the way that these guys were just drilling
*  I was fucked up my legs my arms
*  Because they're they're blocking in their offense defense drills are full speed
*  You know what I mean big gloves shin guards, but they're like
*  And then back and forth and back and forth and speed full speed back and forth and it's just non-stop
*  I think the class was like an hour and a half or their training session was like an hour and a half something
*  like that and I remember leaving and walking home in the cold and I was just like
*  You know and they they knew like oh this guy's a UFC fighter blah blah blah
*  So like I was like fuck. I have to show up tomorrow. I fucking told them that I came here to train
*  I came all the way to Belgium to train
*  Show up the next day or whatever a couple days later do it again, and I'm like dude
*  I don't think I can come back like fuck this
*  Wow so the way that these guys are training that are like aspiring glory fighters, and you know current glory fighters
*  It's a different level man. Wow it's different level of ability of like what they can take
*  You know what I mean like just like pain tolerance and just like their routine and just what they're conditioned for now
*  Yeah, what's the difference in the way they train the way the ties train
*  Okay, so I'd say like
*  Ties don't necessarily spar hard at all
*  I don't know of a place that I've like I haven't seen ties like full-on spar
*  It's very like light-hearted and more playful and skill and things like that
*  a
*  lot more
*  a lot more bag work a
*  lot more attention to
*  balance and defense
*  and then
*  On the pads it's a lot less combinations
*  It's not like that. It's not it's not like that
*  Really?
*  That's why it's very cringe to me when I come back to America
*  And I see these guys who are teaching Muay Thai and it's like these seven punch
*  Combinations just because it's punching and kicking and you're throwing in knees and elbows doesn't make it Muay Thai
*  You know what I mean? Like it's not it's not the same essence in my opinion
*  So how do they hold pads over there like it's so like for instance like when I was when I was training my trainer
*  It's like it's more of like he's drawing out
*  What he kind of wants to see from me based off of my position and like how I'm standing and where I'm standing
*  So he'll kill have his distance and he'll kind of sometimes won't even really tell me what to do
*  He'll just kind of like insinuate like like body kick boom and then however I land then maybe he'll hold the right hand and
*  Then boom however I land after that maybe hold the hook
*  And then from the hook and then maybe he'll hold the leg kick, but it kind of depends on like where am I at?
*  Right, you know, like what's my position? He's not like, okay jab cross hook low kick. Oh
*  It's more based off of your fighter. How does your fighter flow?
*  Right, you know what I mean?
*  So like in that distance if I'm if he's like telling me if he's just like cuz my trainers didn't speak English at all
*  I had to kind of like learn to adapt so he would just be like
*  Kind of like doing this like okay slow down relax calm. So I'm like, okay
*  Relax and then he'll quickly like that and then I have to kick boom and then he'll like to and a pump boom
*  And then he'll like, okay relax
*  Punch boom elbow boom like it's just kind of calling out these reactions
*  Not giving me this like eight punch combo four punch combo. Okay in with
*  It's just a lot more instinct. It's a lot more like stay calm stay relaxed
*  And when you attack I don't want to see that you're about to attack me. I need it to come
*  Quick and like I need you to go right back to relax
*  Yeah, I need to go right back to a relaxed position, you know
*  And so do you feel like this kind of pad holding is more applicable for an actual fight like developing skills?
*  I think so. I mean like especially if you want to
*  Kick or punch or do anything at like a full power, right?
*  Because I do notice that like like from the tie pad work. That's where you practice your power
*  That's where like the on the bag and on the pads. It's more power, right?
*  It's less like boxing is more like focus mitts. Mm-hmm
*  You don't really do power with boxing on on mitts, but with like with Muay Thai
*  It's like this is my chance to be like how how effective is my left kick at a hundred percent?
*  Yeah, and I'm like trusting this guy to be able to catch it for me
*  so I
*  Prefer it I make I prefer the the true essence and the true martial art of Muay Thai because it's it's
*  when you when you kind of understand it and when you've kind of learned it from you know, like
*  just different traditions and like different lineages, it's like you can
*  You can pick up on things. They're like, okay now, okay. Yeah, this is this is I can fucking ruin someone
*  If I like relax right here and I'm standing just like an arm's length of this guy and I just want to really blast the
*  Kick and be on balance. I can ruin this guy, you know, you also were telling me that they changed the way you were kicking
*  Yeah
*  So everyone like everyone has their own way
*  It's like if you go to a jujitsu school and like an armbar is an armbar
*  But people have different ways of like setting it up or right more effective to to get it
*  The biggest thing that kind of helped me was for one like a
*  Lot of people when they kick they lean back to kind of counterbalance that weight
*  And my trainer always told me like he always had me like a dry it like drive my pressure forward
*  I actually wish that I was fucking training with you. I was here side note
*  I was like damn dude sick to fucking to show some stuff to Rogan. But anyway, he was showing me like next time
*  Yeah, yeah, I got a whole gym here. Yeah, I saw it. It's probably way better now than oh, yeah
*  Yeah, just moved in here but
*  Kind of like this more like forward projection. Mm-hmm. So like all of my weight and plus the kick
*  moving forward versus standing stationary lifting my and
*  Going back, you know, like there's like a
*  no tilting
*  The turning of the hips like kicking with the shin and not the foot like so there's a lot of little details that go into
*  Like making these things happen
*  You know and also the speed of the kick like a lot a big problem that I see in
*  MMA for sure is that like man I can see kicks coming from a mile away, right because there's just so much
*  Just to get your leg up you should just be able to fucking whip it and it still be as a powerful and as effective
*  Yeah, you were saying something about the smoothness of though
*  They taught you how to relax more when you're throwing kicks. I have like you have to relax like the kicks
*  The leg is the heaviest
*  Limb on the body, you know and just like if you want to knock someone out, you don't want
*  Tense up first you got to be relaxed
*  It's got to be swift
*  so it's kind of like in order to lift your leg to throw it at a full speed and
*  Like and to for it to be accurate. You got to be relaxed
*  You have to and how much of that is like
*  When you're training how much of your training when you're working on technique is kicking the bag
*  How much of is kicking pads how much of is kicking the air?
*  Okay, so I kick the bag a lot. I
*  Just have a bag in my house and everything's usually like slow just getting my body to move and
*  Comfortable with lifting my leg and it just be effortless
*  Just the technique. Yeah, just the technique and like the flow and like the feeling
*  I want you to at home like how much warm-up do you do before you do anything like that?
*  It kind of is my warm-up. So yeah, I just I do it lightly until my intensity picks up and until I'm like
*  Right, you know, so I'll start off really slow
*  Yeah, I post like a video the other day. It's like of my routine
*  Like I just like I put on this music like Thai country. Oh, let me see it. Yeah, it's uh, yeah
*  Actually, if you pull that up, you'll see like that's kind of my daily
*  Like my daily routine so
*  I'd say a lot of my training. It's like probably 60% is just like shadow boxing light bag work working on balance
*  Um, yeah
*  So just nice see like what are you listening to i'll put it on that's like the classic
*  Thai music
*  Yeah
*  so trying not like even here i'm trying not to lean my head back and try to keep more of like a station like a
*  Straight up and down posture while throwing the kick. It's very hard
*  But it's like as you practice it it only makes the kicks a little bit more effective
*  So this is at your house. Yeah, this is however your bag
*  130
*  And so you're just setting stuff up. Yeah
*  Yeah, just touch because like
*  I I need to know that I can touch it before I need to like before I want to blast it
*  And so that's how you warm up you warm up. Just gently
*  I just do that until I'm I end up like really sweaty fucking hard on the back, you know
*  I feel like okay. I've done this motion enough to where now I can
*  Release at 120 percent. I can just fucking do you do a lot of stretching? Yeah, I spend
*  Probably three to four hours a day stretching. Wow. Yeah
*  Really? Yeah, holy shit. It's like one of my hobbies. I just I love it like if i'm not okay
*  So when I wake up in the morning
*  i'll
*  Say like
*  Sparring say I have sparring at 11 30. I get to the gym by nine and i'm stretching for two hours
*  Wow, I use olympic rings. I love stretching on olympic rings
*  I'll put them like so I hang them out at like a nice height and i'll put my arms through and they're just like
*  Kind of here and then i'm like flexing down and it kind of helps elongate my spine
*  I'm practicing like decompressing. Yeah decompressing
*  I'll put it like on the like under my elbow here and i'll kind of like do like the iron cross and just kind of
*  I do a lot of just different like unique type of stretches and I do them every single day
*  And I just want to make sure that like my body feels as free as possible. I hate tightness
*  I fucking hate my lower back so tight right now and I hate it, you know
*  That's just one of the the oh I got some shit I could show you for that, please. Yeah. Yeah
*  That's cool shit here so yeah, like i'd say a lot of a lot of my time and a day is spent stretching
*  That's crazy three to four hours three to four hours a day man
*  That's not like sometimes it's two hours and then i'll go train and then later like an hour before I go to bed
*  you know, um, but
*  Yeah, a lot of my time a lot of my time with my fucking wife. So it's like oh, where's that in the garage fucking stretching?
*  You know what I mean? Like what kind of makes sense though when you think about how free you are when you're fighting like everything
*  Is so fast gotta be really good. Yeah gotta be real and you have to be loose to do that
*  Yeah, yeah, i've talked to guys who aren't flexible like I was trying to explain
*  Uh, I was trying to show someone some guard technique a guy was fighting in the I don't want to say his name
*  And I was like so when you're in this position here, I was showing them how to use a rubber guard
*  I'm like so i'm i'm in control here and he's like I can't get my leg up right there
*  I'm like, what do you mean? You can't get your leg up right there. He's like, I just I don't have any flexibility
*  I'm like do you stretch? Yeah, it's like no i'm like you don't stretch. You're a world class fighter and you don't stretch
*  Yeah, i'm an old comedian and i'm showing you that I can do this. This is crazy
*  You should be able to do this. Yeah, like this is not a thing that's hard rubber guard. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean sometimes like especially right now it'd be really hard for me to do rubber guard. But um, why?
*  Okay, so the other day I was working out
*  Uh, I do these like saturday workouts. I invite my friends
*  We do like a kind of boot camp like circuit thing just something for me to stay active and to invite my friends to come
*  You know enjoy a healthy lifestyle
*  um, I have a friend who's
*  Older guy and he was doing amazing air squats and I was like
*  Just banter. I was like you call that a squat
*  Anybody in the right mind would have known like yeah, this is a good fucking squat, you know
*  But for some reason I don't know what what's going on that day
*  He took it personally and he was like what you have the worst fucking squats in here you fucking
*  And just like blew up on me and I was like, whoa, dude
*  Didn't know we were going that route
*  But since you want to fucking you know what I mean since you want to test the waters
*  And then I just started fucking air squatting like a maniac and bust out like 80 air squats
*  I got my asshole almost touched the ground, you know, it's like going full speed
*  um
*  And then like I just I was kind of like rubbed the wrong way
*  So I just went hard and I wasn't really thinking about
*  Posture or technique or anything. I kind of tweaked my back a little bit
*  And then that wasn't the end of the workout
*  We still had to go and burn a thousand calories on the on the assault bike
*  Oh, no, then I hop on the bike and a full blast, you know, like you back so 40 miles an hour just
*  And it kept hurting and I was like i'm not going to show these guys that i'm hurt. I'm gonna just i'm a dog
*  You know as I get back on
*  And by the end of the workout like I mean for the past like three days, it's been real hard
*  Oh, wow, real hard. So my lower back right now and then
*  The day after that I went and I have to swing the golf club like at least four times four days a week
*  Jamie has one of those things out here. Yeah simulator. He told me that thing. Yeah, yeah, he's a nut
*  He's out there all the time. Yeah. Yeah, um that would that would definitely inhibit your rubber guard, but normally you could probably do it
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah, normally. Yeah, you should be able to do that. Yeah, it's like if you're on your back. That's it's a
*  Regardless of what people think that's a it's a very effective technique
*  Yeah, and i've put people in and i'm like get out here. Let me hold you actually try to get out not
*  On the topic of rubber guard, but after we're done with this i'm going to show you this sick sweet thing that i'm working on
*  Okay, it's like it's really cool. I'm going to show it to you
*  And then when you see me do it in a fight, you're like, holy shit. Oh, all right. Yeah
*  unseen unheard of um, and it's a mixture of like
*  what i've learned like some
*  Muay Thai concepts and like uh and like yeah muay thai concepts and like methods
*  Mixed with what i've been learning in my jiu-jitsu because i'm training with a guy who's a black boat under damien maya
*  um, and so a lot of the jiu-jitsu stuff that i'm working from like learning from him is amazingly effective
*  Especially for my mentality and like my body style
*  So like in my off time and in my stretching and just my artistic mind
*  I was like, how do I blend these two together? Wow got it. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's an idea
*  It's nice. It's sick. And how much time do you spend boxing?
*  I don't box a lot. Yeah, i'd say like my pad work. Um
*  Like my mma pad work is a lot of hands not necessarily like boxing boxing
*  Just kind of like mma boxing but um, I mean I would love to do more boxing. I just noticed that when I focus on
*  Boxing like I have in the past. Um, I just get a little bit more flat-footed
*  Um, you know and because of my nature and my spirit i'm just willing to stand and bang like
*  And just right right, you know
*  And i'm like waiting on counters and i'm waiting to roll and i'm like, oh i'm gonna just wait right here
*  and i'm gonna slip and react and counter but
*  um, so it
*  Sometimes can put me in a little bit of a bad position
*  But if I find the right boxing trainer that kind of understands mma and understands my style
*  I could see it being effective, but I haven't found that yet. So you just put it all together. Yeah
*  That's your thing
*  Well, listen man, um, i'm bummed out that you're going through all this bullshit
*  But um, i'm really excited to see you back in there man
*  I really really am especially after the anth- well, i've been a fan for a long time
*  But the anthony smith fight was like it shows me that you are
*  You're right there. You're right there. I hope you know, jeff sorted out
*  Everybody in Nevada state athletic commission
*  Sort it out and hopefully you can call the next one too, right? Oh, I hope so. That'd be amazing
