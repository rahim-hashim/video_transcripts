# Joe Rogan Experience #2031 - Luis J. Gomez
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0)
*  Are we on? Are we just on? Are we on? Yeah. All right. I don't know if we're talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=0.0s)]
*  on the podcast just being dudes. That's the beautiful thing about podcasts. It really [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  hanging. Yeah. But yeah, I smoked weed since I was like 17 and it was illegal. And you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=22.72s)]
*  just you all these like formative years spending my life being afraid that a cop was going [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=31.2s)]
*  to come and arrest me. And I've been arrested for smoking weed like 10 times in New York [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  City. Wow. Because I'm an idiot. And I just you know, right. And it's just a game of numbers. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=39.92s)]
*  I would just we would roll a blunt in the park, you smoke it. And every time for some [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  reason, the cop would always take me all my friends. They'd be like, you know, we got [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=48.2s)]
*  to take one of you. And it was always I'm the only brown kid in the group. So every [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=51.0s)]
*  single time they were like, we're going to take you. And then they take it essential [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=54.32s)]
*  bookings for a day. And literally say I have to take one of you. Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=57.64s)]
*  And none of your friends. Hey, you got Lewis the last three times. Not once. Dave Smith. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=62.6s)]
*  I've been arrested. I was arrested three separate times. And Dave Smith watched me get put into [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=67.12s)]
*  the back of a car and he was like, bye. Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. And then I remember [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=72.32s)]
*  I went to Amsterdam when I was 22. And it was the first time I ever smoked legal weed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=77.8s)]
*  And I just I was like, this is this is great. This is the way it should be. It was nuts. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=82.24s)]
*  I was just like smoking in the street. I was talking to a cop. I was on mushrooms. I was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  like, this is so peaceful and nice. And then I came back and I remember I was in a stairwell [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  smoking a blunt like the day I got back. And I was like, this is fucking a wild thing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=95.86s)]
*  And then here we are years later in New York City. It's legal. There's literally you can [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=99.6s)]
*  buy weed and just delis on every corner in New York City now. It's crazy. Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=103.92s)]
*  I remember the switch in California because for a while I was medical. So I used to have to go to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=107.88s)]
*  a doctor and the doctor would go, oh, you need weed. And then he writes some shit down [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  a piece of paper. Then you could buy weed. Yeah. And I used to go to this place called [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=117.16s)]
*  the Englewood Wellness Center, which was in Englewood. And it's, you know, a shady area. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=120.68s)]
*  And back then, I don't know if it was credit cards yet. I don't I think they might have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=126.2s)]
*  been able to use credit cards. But I know they also had a lot of cash on them and they got [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=133.32s)]
*  robbed. And the guy that I used to buy weed from got shot. Oh, shit. And I was like, all right, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=136.44s)]
*  done with that spot. I'm going to have to find a new spot. But there wasn't that many spots. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=141.16s)]
*  You would have to like find these places. And they looked like shut down stores. Like most of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=145.0s)]
*  the places that were dispensaries, they were like super low key. Like you had to know people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=149.48s)]
*  And you would go in there and, you know, there'd be some fucking doctor. One time I went to this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=153.88s)]
*  doctor and he had dreadlocks. And these dudes had like long dreads. And he had a volcano bag, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=158.84s)]
*  you know, in the volcano. But it was like an extra long bag. And we walk into the dispensary [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=165.64s)]
*  and he's like, man, you need medicine. He just immediately goes, you need some medicine. I go, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  yes, sir, I do. Thank you. I'm very sick. He took us to the grow room. I don't know if you've ever [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  been in a grow room when you're high. No, but they seem to be intelligent. There's an odd feeling [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=184.76s)]
*  that you get when you're high on marijuana and you walk into a grow room filled with like hundreds [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=191.8s)]
*  of plants. It was a big ass room with lights, you know, hydroponic lights, whatever hanging from the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  sky. And it just has a weird feel to it. Yeah, it has a weird feel, like not a regular room. It doesn't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=203.0s)]
*  feel like you're walking into a room. It feels like you're walking into a room with beings. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, like they feel alive in a weird way. Yeah. And I know, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=215.24s)]
*  I know it's super high. That's a good weed that you have. I mean, but it felt real because it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=221.0s)]
*  didn't feel like that when I was in the other room. When I was in the other room where they had just [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=226.6s)]
*  like couches and shit, you know, seemed normal. Then he takes us back and we go into this back [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  room and I'm like, whoa, like these things are conscious. Well, they say that. Don't they say [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=236.2s)]
*  plants are conscious to a certain degree? If you like sing to them and talk to them or if you yell [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=241.4s)]
*  at them, they don't grow or, I don't know. They do like experiments with shit where like people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=244.6s)]
*  are like nice to plants. I've seen that one like TikTok and like reels. I've never looked into that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah, it has to be bullshit. There's no way if you're just nice to a plant, it grows better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=254.04s)]
*  Well, how do you, what an unethical experiment because then you'd have to be really mean to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=257.56s)]
*  another plant. It's really, really racist to the plant. Fucking ficus, piece of shit. I fucking [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=261.56s)]
*  hate ficus's. I kill them every time I find them. Not in my yard. And he's just stuck in the dirt [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=268.12s)]
*  in your house. Oh, if plants really are conscious and they're stuck in the dirt in people's houses [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=274.28s)]
*  and the people are doing math and shooting each other, these plants would be like, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=280.84s)]
*  I gotta get the fuck out of here. How am I stuck in this house? It's like that, what's that Metallica [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=284.92s)]
*  video one where the guy's like just stuck in the bed and he could, but he's conscious and he could [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=289.88s)]
*  hear everything. It's from a famous movie, I think. I don't remember that. He was, he was like, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=294.28s)]
*  dude, you definitely remember this. It's such a famous video. It's the Metallica one video. It was [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=299.4s)]
*  Johnny Get Your Gun or something is the movie. And it was a guy, I guess he was hurt in war. Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=303.64s)]
*  And he was conscious and he could hear everything, but he couldn't communicate. Oh, wow. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=310.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's, uh, this is the life of a house plant right here. Dude, Metallica had some bangers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=317.08s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like, they know that they communicate with each other. That's what's really [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=327.96s)]
*  fascinating. They communicate with each other through the mycelium and the ground. So it does [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=332.6s)]
*  say they grow, they grow better. Look, it says for most plants playing classical or jazz music [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=338.12s)]
*  cause growth to increase while harsher metal music can do stress. Wow. This may be because the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=343.24s)]
*  vibrations of metal music are too intense for plants and stimulate cells a little too much. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=348.68s)]
*  We think of this as massaging your plant with a song. They prefer a gentler touch, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=353.24s)]
*  but how do we know? I want to know the boring bitch who wrote this article. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=358.36s)]
*  How do we not know that it's not that at all? How do we not? I mean, that's an assumption. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=364.44s)]
*  That's like minimalizing their ability to recognize what's going on. Cause right. Like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=370.36s)]
*  put that up again, like how it's explained. Because the way it's explained, it's like, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  it's here. It says this may because the vibrations of metal music are too intense for plants and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=381.72s)]
*  stimulate cells a little too much. Like, how do you know? How do you know the plant just doesn't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=387.4s)]
*  think that music sucks? Could you imagine? It's like, you know, when they were, when they were [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=392.12s)]
*  torturing Noriega, they would fucking just Blair horrible music at him forever. Remember that? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=397.0s)]
*  Yeah. They did that with, uh, it was the, the, what was the big group that was like, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=404.28s)]
*  there was like a standoff and then they did it with Billy Ray Cyrus, his song, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=408.76s)]
*  Ike, break your heart. There was some, yeah, it was some like, some like some dude who had like a [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=411.72s)]
*  bunch of people captive and they played Ike, break your heart to fuck with him. Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  I do have to say though, that at least shows a sense of humor by the police. Yeah. I think [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  that's pretty funny. That's fucking hilarious. That's funny. Play bad music until this dude [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  fucking moves out of the house with the hostages. But I know they, they did it with 99% sure they [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=431.64000000000004s)]
*  did it with Noriega. I forget what the songs were though. See what they did with Manuel Noriega [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=439.88s)]
*  because I'm pretty sure they surrounded his house in Panama and just played horrible music. Yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=445.08s)]
*  Let's see. I fought the law. Oh, that's pretty good. The clash shit Panama by the stadium. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  I guess any song over and over and over again would drive you out of your mind. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=456.52s)]
*  They played Panama by Van Halen. You choose. All I want is you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  Bruce Cockburn, if I had a rocket launcher and they just kept playing it over and over again. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=463.56s)]
*  Oh, and the Howard Stern show. So at least they gave him some entertainment while he's contemplating [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=471.64000000000004s)]
*  death. Yeah. Is he dead? Yeah. Did they kill him or did he go to jail? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=475.56s)]
*  That's that might be even more wild than when they killed them. They take these dictators and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=485.24s)]
*  just stick them in a cell. Bye bye. Never hear of them again. Bye bye. And then it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=490.12s)]
*  stops being a news story and nobody cares. Bye bye. Yeah. Bye bye Mr. First Renewer in Country. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=493.64s)]
*  Have you ever been in a jail cell, Joe? No. You've never been arrested for anything ever? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=498.36s)]
*  Nope. Never. Damn. Noriega's mugshot after a surrender to US forces in 1990, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=503.24s)]
*  age 56. How many people had that guy killed? You never even been in cuffs? No. Damn. I'm a good [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=509.4s)]
*  boy. You are a good boy. It's the worst. I could only imagine. I'm always very respectful to cops. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=518.04s)]
*  I'm super respectful to cops too because at that point they're arresting me and I want to get out [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=525.0s)]
*  I want to get off of the warning. I've never done anything real. Like I've never done a real crime. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=529.64s)]
*  It's always for smoking weed or they say they expunge all of them. They did. They did. They [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=533.24s)]
*  always should with everybody with that. We should wake up as a country and realize those laws are [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=539.88s)]
*  immoral. They don't make any sense. I came about in Canada for years. I couldn't go to Canada. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=543.88s)]
*  If we can drink, why can't we smoke? It makes zero sense. You guys are out of your minds. You [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=548.68s)]
*  don't smoke weed. You don't know what you're talking about. It's like that's part of the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=555.0s)]
*  problem is that the people that are making these laws, they don't have any experience with these [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=560.2s)]
*  drugs. Yeah. You know, I'm good. You're good. There's like a certain, I think you should know [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=564.12s)]
*  what you're talking about. And if we lie about it, then people are going to be more likely to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=570.84s)]
*  abuse it because they're not going to think there's any problems. Yeah. You got to be like [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=577.0s)]
*  fully straightforward with it. It's probably one of the safest drugs you could use if you're not [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=581.08s)]
*  a schizophrenic. Are they? If you're not a person who has like that that fucking missing screw and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=586.44s)]
*  then the weed takes you over the top because there's a few of those guys. Yeah. I mean, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=592.6s)]
*  I know some people that they're not good on it. I know I'm probably better as a human when I'm [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=597.24s)]
*  not smoking weed, just in terms of productivity, just in terms of like just being a little bit [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=602.92s)]
*  sharper, but I'm also miserable and depressed and fucking anxious. So it's like, it's a trade off. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=607.32s)]
*  You know, I like to walk the dance. I like the walk to dance between high and sobriety. I like it. I [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=614.44s)]
*  like both of them. I think this idea, I mean, look, if you're a person who's an alcoholic, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=622.2s)]
*  sobriety is your choice. That's the way to go for sure. And you don't need it. And look, you could, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=627.5600000000001s)]
*  you can get high doing yoga. You could, you could feel pretty good when you run, but if you can [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=632.36s)]
*  handle it and if it's for you, it provides you like a different window to the world. And I think it [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=637.48s)]
*  changes and shapes the way you think about things. I agree with that, but I think the, just the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=643.48s)]
*  difference in thinking does that as well. So if I, I smoke all day, every day, right? So if I stop [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=648.68s)]
*  smoking for like a week, it's like I'm seeing the world differently. Your brain gets to clear out [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=654.04s)]
*  a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just a different perspective. It's kind of good to do that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I just, and then the other thing, now that I'm getting older, I'm 41 now, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=664.28s)]
*  I still don't, I mean, I can probably research this. Does weed just not cause cancer? Does it [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=668.04s)]
*  not? Like nobody's talking about weed giving them fucking cancer. I smoke a lot of fucking weed and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=674.12s)]
*  I'm just in my head about it. I'm like, dude, I'm going to get lung cancer because I've been [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=678.12s)]
*  smoking blunts and weed for so long. It doesn't seem to, and I don't know why it wouldn't if [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=681.24s)]
*  cigarettes do. No, no, there, here's a question. Is there a difference between those natural [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=687.8s)]
*  cigarettes that people enjoy? Like those American spirits and like Marlboro's? I don't think they're [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=693.48s)]
*  natural. That's just, that's good branding. Cause they even have Joe Rogan going, dude, those natural [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=698.84s)]
*  say they're not, it's the same shit. But it's, that's the name of them. Isn't it? It's the American [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=702.84s)]
*  spirit. I think it's just some, we assume they're natural because American Indians make them. I [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=706.44s)]
*  think. Is there a bunch of shit in there? Our research shows the majority of natural American [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  spirit smokers incorrectly believe their cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes. The truth out [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  there, they're just as dangerous as any other cigarette. Yeah, dude, that's, I always thought [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  it's a cigarette. Like light cigarettes were safer and they're not at all. No, that's probably even [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  worse. Like what is in those? Okay. What are menthol? What's going on? I don't even know. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  What is going on? They're trying to outlaw that in California. Yeah. Well, because I think they did [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=734.52s)]
*  a lot because they, they say it's, they're going after like any of the flavored tobacco shit. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=739.48s)]
*  Like you can't get flavored blunt reps in New York city anymore because the, I guess the angle [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=744.76s)]
*  is they're saying that kids are more likely to buy flavored stuff. Which is just, I think that's kind [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=749.64s)]
*  of stupid as well. What about flavored liquor? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're not taking away anyone's [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=755.24s)]
*  liquor anymore. How come you can still have flavored liquor? What are you talking about? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=760.84s)]
*  Like there's syrupy liquor. Yeah. Yeah. All the smoking laws are kind of good too in a weird way [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  though. Or they do the, cause I smoked cigarettes in New York when they started, they were just like, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=770.44s)]
*  we're going to just charge you a fucking crazy amount for cigarettes. It went up, it went from [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  like $3 a pack of cigarettes to like $15 a pack in like a year. And they just priced a lot of people [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=778.6800000000001s)]
*  out. I was just too broke to fucking spend $15 per pack of cigarettes. It was crazy. It was like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=785.72s)]
*  75 cents per cigarette as like a broke young kid in New York city. It's just what's going to happen. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=791.48s)]
*  So they, so they, they made it the, the, the age 21 and then they started charging a fucking arm [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=796.36s)]
*  and a leg for it. And just kids just couldn't afford them anymore. So I think a lot less kids [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=802.28s)]
*  are smoking today because of all that shit. But yeah, I mean, when I moved to New York city, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=805.64s)]
*  you could still smoke inside of bars and then they changed that like a year later. And I remember [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=811.32s)]
*  being like, no, this is crazy. Who cares about the employee's health? I give a fuck. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=815.0s)]
*  People did get upset that they couldn't smoke indoors. I remember when you'd go to comedy [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=820.2s)]
*  clubs, they were filled with smoke. Every table had an ashtray. They were filled with smoke, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=824.6s)]
*  but you would hear stories about like waitresses that didn't even smoke and they would get cancer. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=830.2s)]
*  That's when it gets scary. It's like people that are forced to breed that smoke all day and they [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=836.36s)]
*  don't even smoke. That's fucked. That's an office hazard or a job hazard. You can't force [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=841.4s)]
*  somebody to work in those. Yeah. Now as an adult, but when I'm a kid, where I just want to smoke a [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  cigarette in the back of a bar, it's like, you're not, but now we all smoke weed in comedy clubs. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=850.6s)]
*  That's a weird thing. It's well, we just started smoking weed. Like, I don't know, like eight [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=855.56s)]
*  years ago in comedy clubs and nobody said anything. It was never legal. We just decided we were going [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=859.56s)]
*  to do it. It was because Chappelle was smoking cigarettes. And then somebody was like, no dude, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=864.28s)]
*  we can smoke. It's part of the act. Right. And nobody said anything, but nobody's been, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=867.16s)]
*  there's definitely way more acceptance of weed. People understand what it is now. And there's so [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=870.68s)]
*  many people that are like right wing people use weed. That's like that. That's the big shift [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=874.52s)]
*  because it used to be that weed is just like for hippies and losers, but a lot of people that are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  in pain use it. A lot of people that get headaches use it. A lot of people that it helps them sleep. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  They like edibles. It helps them sleep. They like it. Yeah. That's the way to go. I gotta, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=888.92s)]
*  I gotta switch the edibles. I gotta switch the edibles. Cause I think putting anything in your [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=893.0s)]
*  lungs over an extended amount of time, there's no fucking way it's good for you. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=896.76s)]
*  Edibles are totally different though. You know, it's totally different. What do you mean? It's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=900.52s)]
*  totally different drug. Like your body metabolizes it differently. Yeah. It becomes five hydro, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  11 hydroxy metabolite. Right. That's what it is. It's a, it's processed by your liver [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=909.16s)]
*  and it's just a way more potent psychoactive. Oh, and that's probably not good for your liver. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=914.04s)]
*  I don't know. I don't think it's bad for your liver. I think especially if you're not like [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=918.12s)]
*  fucking blasting it every day. I've never heard that it's toxic. There's got, there's, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=922.2s)]
*  it can't all be good. Weed can't just be the perfect drug. There's gotta be something negative. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=927.16s)]
*  Right. I think it's negative for some. Anything in life that's good there, you almost have to like [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=932.12s)]
*  pay for it in a way. Right. So that's what I'm just trying to find the angle on why I should stop [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=936.2s)]
*  smoking weed because I, I still haven't heard of anybody getting lung cancer. I'm not hearing [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=941.32s)]
*  about any negative effects. Everyone's just cool and high and it's cheap now. Yeah. Um, I haven't [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=946.28s)]
*  heard any good arguments, but for some people they don't, they're not productive when they're on it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=951.8s)]
*  They can't get anything done. They just want to veg out all day. Yeah. But I think it hits everybody. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=958.12s)]
*  CBD may be harmful to your liver, but probably won't affect your kidneys or your heart. CBD may [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=962.76s)]
*  raise levels of liver enzymes. This could indicate liver damage. In most cases it happens with very [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=968.3599999999999s)]
*  high doses of CBD when it's taken with certain medications or when it's taken with certain [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=974.84s)]
*  medications. This is all like this. That's crazy. I wonder what, how much CBD fucks you up? The [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=981.72s)]
*  problem with medical shit like this is you never really know. They have to give you like the whole [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=986.9200000000001s)]
*  spectrum and they're like, Oh no, this could happen just so you know. But I feel like, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=991.4s)]
*  and it could be the anti CBD lobbies. Who knows propaganda. Yeah. Who knows? Who fucking knows [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=996.12s)]
*  anymore with these people? Um, but yeah, I mean, CBD has always been, I've always, I've always used [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1001.64s)]
*  it. I've always used it on like, I have a knee injury right now. I use it on my knee. It's fucking [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1007.24s)]
*  great. Yeah. It's really good. It's great when you got like aches and pains. How much CBD do you get [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1010.68s)]
*  from just smoking weed though? You probably get some, right? We get a decent amount. I think they [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1014.84s)]
*  make strains that are like higher with CBD or have more CBD than THC. Yeah. I know a lot of people [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1019.16s)]
*  who just smoke CBD joints where it doesn't have any THC at all, which is like what kind of frank [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1024.28s)]
*  and medicine you're doing over there, man. Those people, I would love to meet that person and try [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1030.92s)]
*  to sell them anything. Bro, they're making new life. If plants really are intelligent when we're [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1037.72s)]
*  making like splicing them together and giving them superpowers, it's fucking, it's weird what [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1042.2s)]
*  botanists can do. I was in a Costa Rica a few weeks ago and like, I'm never like in nature like [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1048.28s)]
*  that. Like, and it's a really, dude, it's a really cool, like the, we were at a place called manual [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1055.4s)]
*  Antonio park. I don't know if you've been there before and it's just like a huge like nature [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1060.52s)]
*  reserve, massive, massive park. And one of the more interesting things were like the trees, right? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1064.92s)]
*  And then we had a tour guide and I don't know shit about this, but there are certain trees that start [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1070.52s)]
*  attacking each other and they like one tree would wrap around the other tree and kill that tree. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1075.4s)]
*  And then the other tree was sort of growing specific roots that break that other tree. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  It was the coolest thing I'd ever, I was also high, but it was the coolest thing that I had [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1083.8s)]
*  ever fucking heard of. And I was like, there's so many like, and they have like a bazillion plants [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  there and like, it's just such a crazy, crazy world. That's some fucking real like alien life [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1092.44s)]
*  shit. When you move away from like animals and you start looking like plants, there's a lot of [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1097.24s)]
*  crazy plants out there. Yeah, there's a lot. Do you know that they splice different species of [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  plants together? I think it's avocados and pistachios. I forget which one is the bottom [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1107.72s)]
*  and which one is the top. This is counter to what I just pulled up about liver. Oh, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1115.48s)]
*  marijuana may protect the liver from alcohol. Yeah, it says those liver enzymes can protect [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1119.4s)]
*  against alcohol. Just two articles that disagree. Marijuana is the perfect drug. It's the same [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1124.2s)]
*  fucking internet giving us two different things. But that's like smoking it versus CBD. The CBD [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1128.92s)]
*  thing is almost mostly edible. Instead that they didn't know which strain they were using, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1134.12s)]
*  so they didn't know exactly what part of the cannabinoids were protecting. So they need to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1138.1999999999998s)]
*  do more research, but they did 320,000 people. Yeah, that's the thing that used to suck about [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1143.56s)]
*  those THC pills. Remember they had those THC pills? What the fuck was that called? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1148.52s)]
*  There was like a synthetic marijuana that was in. Oh, yeah. Like spice or some shit. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1154.28s)]
*  Oh, there was ones that you could buy in like delis back in the day that was like, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1161.0800000000002s)]
*  they look like weeds. No, no, no, no. Wasn't there like a pharmaceutical? It was like a real thing. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1165.24s)]
*  Yeah. What was the purpose of that? Marinal. Marinal. That's right. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1169.96s)]
*  It was a pharmaceutical version of cannabis. Is that what it was? It was in. I remember it, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1177.0800000000002s)]
*  but I don't remember what it was. Do you remember this? No, I never heard of it. Yeah, there was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1182.92s)]
*  like a weed pill. You guys were out in California though. You guys got a lot of shit that we just [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1188.04s)]
*  didn't get. But I don't even. Okay. Cancer treatment. Okay, it treats nausea and vomiting [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1192.28s)]
*  caused by cancer treatment. So instead of giving people actual marijuana, they gave them this [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1199.72s)]
*  Marinal shit. And people were diagnosed with AIDS. The medication comes in capsule form. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1205.0s)]
*  You can take by mouth as directed. The brand name of this medication is Marinal. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1211.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it was back in the day, right? It was for nausea. That's why people would smoke weed. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1217.16s)]
*  That was the only thing really when they first started talking about medical marijuana, it was [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1221.88s)]
*  like for cancer patients, for nausea would help you eat. And then they started figuring out all [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1225.64s)]
*  the other shit that it's good for CBD, especially. Right. Yeah. So yeah, maybe that's why it doesn't [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1230.44s)]
*  cause cancer. Maybe it's fighting your cancer simultaneously while you're smoking it. Well, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1235.64s)]
*  there has been, I don't know, but you got to wonder like what's causing cancer. Maybe it's just like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1239.64s)]
*  decreasing inflammation in general. And that's probably what's protecting you from cancer. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1245.48s)]
*  Maybe. I'm fucking terrified. I'm terrified of cancer. It's terrifying. It should be terrifying. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1250.04s)]
*  Yeah. It should be terrified of all kinds of things like asteroids, ice ages. I'm not terrified [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1256.6s)]
*  of asteroids. I've never once thought about it. You always hear about it. I'm like, oh, they [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1264.3600000000001s)]
*  miss the earth by like, it's always like a hundred thousand miles. That doesn't seem that close. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1269.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's just a time thing, Louis. It's just a time thing. What do you mean? It's just a time [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1275.8799999999999s)]
*  thing. We're going to get hit. It's inevitable. It's happened thousands of times probably while [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1281.56s)]
*  human beings have been alive. Look, some of them are big. If an asteroid hits Mars and we hear about [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1288.4399999999998s)]
*  it, then I'm going to go, all right, fuck, we're in trouble. Well, they had a hat and a big one hit [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1294.12s)]
*  Jupiter once. Oh, really? Yeah. And they really were surprised because the impact was like far [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1300.04s)]
*  larger than they thought it was going to be, but it was an enormous one. Apparently that's what [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1308.28s)]
*  protects us. Jupiter is so massive that it like sucks up most of the asteroids and comets. That's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1312.6s)]
*  what allows us to not just be pelted all the time because there's like hundreds of thousands of [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1318.36s)]
*  these near earth objects that are just fucking flying around. Joe, why are you trying to scare [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1322.92s)]
*  the audience right now? I don't really understand. What is your amber here? I'm not trying to scare [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  anybody. These people are terrified right now. This is just what I think about all the time. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1329.0800000000002s)]
*  The gas giant regularly absorbs hits from comets and asteroids protecting their inner solar system [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1331.72s)]
*  worlds. Damn. Yeah, I think they have the photo of it getting hit, but it got hit by some just [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1336.92s)]
*  fucking dinosaur killer. Yeah. Just some big one. Just shah-boom. Yeah, something like that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1345.4s)]
*  That's a wrap so that you could see it. You could actually see it get hit. There's just no control [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1352.2s)]
*  with that. There's nothing that I can do. If we get hit by an asteroid one day, that's that. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1357.72s)]
*  I can control not giving myself cancer by smoking blunts every day. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1363.4s)]
*  Or maybe that's what's making you not have cancer. Yeah. Damn. Maybe this is my Jupiter. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1367.48s)]
*  That's saving you. Yeah, that's your Jupiter. There we go. Yeah, just space in general. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1373.96s)]
*  It's like the most insane prospect ever. This infinite thing that we exist in and there's rocks [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1379.64s)]
*  flying through it that occasionally slam into the planet and cause civilization to reset. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1388.76s)]
*  Is that actually what happened with Big Bang Theory, right? That's the idea? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1394.6s)]
*  That's what killed the dinosaurs? Well, Big Bang Theory is the beginning of the universe. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1398.04s)]
*  What killed the dinosaurs is one of these asteroids. I'm an idiot. Yeah. You know, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1402.84s)]
*  yeah. I don't know about any of this stuff. You don't think about asteroids all the time. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't think about asteroids. I think about them all the time. I think about them all the time [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1409.64s)]
*  because I've had these experts on. They've fucking permanently mind fucked me, especially [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1413.72s)]
*  Randall Carlson. He's this dude that along with Graham Hancock, they've come up with this [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1418.7600000000002s)]
*  theory that human beings got hit by asteroids somewhere around 11,800 years ago and civilization [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1426.1200000000001s)]
*  just reset. And we were basically like savages for thousands of years, which totally makes sense. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1434.92s)]
*  And then the civilization that emerged from that, like Babylon and Mesopotamia, the first civilizations [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  we know of like Sumer, those were probably a reboot, like thousands of years of chaos before [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1447.5600000000002s)]
*  they figured out how to calm down and develop civilization again. Yeah. I don't know about any [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1455.0s)]
*  of that shit, dude. How do you talk to these people? You're a fucking comic guy. Were you [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1462.92s)]
*  always this dude you were like super interested in like everything? Because I watch you interview [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1468.52s)]
*  people and you're really fucking good at like having these conversations with these people in [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1473.0800000000002s)]
*  all of these fields. And I'm going like, God damn, dude, like how do you have the capacity [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1477.8000000000002s)]
*  to take that all in and fucking just be interested? But it's only things that I'm interested in. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1483.4s)]
*  Because no comic that I know does that. Like literally no, every other comic is a fucking idiot [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  who's just smoking weed or drinking beer and just trying to show up and get some pussy at the end [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1492.44s)]
*  of the night. And I think, look, you know, it's a compliment because it really is, I think why you [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1495.96s)]
*  created something so big is you're so interested in so much stuff that I think it made like, it [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1500.04s)]
*  gave you this like mass appeal. But was it like always that way or was it doing the podcast that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  turned you into that? Well, I've always been curious, but then doing the podcast allowed me [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1508.44s)]
*  to have all these conversations with people. It's like getting an accidental education. Yeah. It's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1513.72s)]
*  about just a broad range of subjects. Yeah. But for me, it's just, it's just interesting. Like [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1521.08s)]
*  I like listening to people and talking to people and finding out how they tick. Yeah. Who was the [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1528.04s)]
*  most interesting person you had on the show ever? Man, there's probably not one most interesting. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1533.56s)]
*  There's been a lot of them that are interesting. Yeah. You know, Elon's pretty fucking interesting. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1538.12s)]
*  That's a, that's a rare one of a kind human being. Yeah. You know, like they don't make many of those. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  He just said, I'm going to buy Twitter. That's crazy. He overpaid for it by a lot. Yeah. It's [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1550.04s)]
*  gangster as fuck, man. And, but he really truly believed that we're in a very pivotal moment [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1556.2s)]
*  in our civilization when it comes to what is happening with like, particularly with censorship. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  And when you, when you have something that's essentially the town square for the world, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1570.12s)]
*  which Twitter is, if you prevent people from other ideologies or other points of view, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1575.56s)]
*  other political parties, if you prevent them from using this space and only people that agree with [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1583.24s)]
*  you can use that space, that's dangerous. And he recognized that. And I think we all do. It's [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1590.04s)]
*  fucking dangerous. I know you think you're doing it, whoever's doing that, because it's the right [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  thing and we have to protect people from bad ideas, but that never ends well. It just doesn't [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1599.96s)]
*  end well. You, you, you're going to give that control to someone next after you're gone. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1606.44s)]
*  Cause that's going to be like a thing we do now. You're going to give that control to new people [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1611.8000000000002s)]
*  and they're going to turn it the other way. They're going to use it on you. They're going [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1616.44s)]
*  to use it against causes that you believe in. We, we were headed in before Elon bought Twitter, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1619.48s)]
*  we were headed in a really weird, it seemed like very dangerous direction for comedy, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1625.3200000000002s)]
*  for anybody who, you know, anybody who wasn't like super left-wing liberal. If you were trying to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1631.88s)]
*  create shit online, it was like, it was scary. I was like, and I do, you know, we do Legion of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1639.0s)]
*  Skanks, most offensive podcast on earth. We say a lot of fucked up shit, but I was like, we are not [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1643.8s)]
*  going to be able to even put shit on the internet anymore. Forget just like, you know, Twitter or [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1648.2s)]
*  anything else. Like I think they're going to scrub it off from the internet. And then Elon came in [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1652.84s)]
*  and he kind of made people go like, wait a minute, hold on. That was, we were getting crazy and people [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1656.6799999999998s)]
*  kind of pause. You see Shane has a special out on Netflix. Now I feel like we've sort of calmed down [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1660.6s)]
*  a little bit. And that was a big part of it. Cause it was like, well, no, we need to even the playing [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1665.72s)]
*  field a little bit. We need to hear all opinions and hear both sides. So I was actually legitimately [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1669.24s)]
*  worried. And now it seems like this is a little bit of a pause in that. It's definitely a change. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1675.0s)]
*  Of course. The problem is all the other social media platforms are essentially run by people who [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1680.84s)]
*  think the same way. They have the same opinions on things. There's, there's no one social media [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  platform that stands out. That's like a huge place where other than Twitter now or X, where you can [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1694.52s)]
*  just say whatever the fuck you want. Like people were saying, Michelle Obama is a man. Like that's [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1702.6s)]
*  you say the earth is flat. There's like plenty of people that are talking about the earth being flat. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1709.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's also fucking crazy. Say whatever the fuck you want. And there's a, there's a, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1712.28s)]
*  there's only one platform like that. Yeah. Like all the other ones. It's not like there's a bunch [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1718.12s)]
*  of those. It's like, you can go and say whatever you want on Instagram. No, you can't. They'll put [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1722.6s)]
*  a fucking thing saying fact check or this is incorrect and misleading information. And even [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1726.84s)]
*  sometimes I've gone to some of those fact checks. I'm like, you didn't fact check this at all. Right. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1732.68s)]
*  Like this is just like not approved. This is a not approved message. Yeah. I, that's why I try to [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1736.76s)]
*  disconnect from it as much as possible. I think everyone should. We, I think it's truly like the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1742.68s)]
*  downfall of society is social media. I think it's, we're sharing ideas too quickly, too dangerously. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1748.2s)]
*  I don't think it's that, but I think it's transforming society. I think we better catch [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1756.12s)]
*  the fuck up. We better catch up. Well, we will. And look, I think part of it is a lot of these, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1760.6s)]
*  they don't really know how to handle it. It just moves too quickly. Right. Right. So I think that [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1765.88s)]
*  we're going to look back at this time and we're going to go, oh yeah, that was like a real, it [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1771.72s)]
*  was just us getting a hold of the internet. The internet just fucking came out and then we got [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1775.24s)]
*  social media and it's just transformed everything. The whole world, we're all connected. I mean, dude, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1779.4s)]
*  we're it's the world is tiny now. Like it doesn't even feel like, but I think we're going to look [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1783.64s)]
*  back and go like, yeah, we were like irresponsible with it. We were like trying to destroy each other. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1790.3600000000001s)]
*  We were trying to hurt each other with it. It's like, it became like warfare so quickly. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1794.2s)]
*  I put a, I tweeted out a joke the other day, said dumb joke about Amber heard. I don't, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1799.24s)]
*  I don't have a dog in the race. I don't give a shit about Amber heard Johnny Depp. That whole thing, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1803.4s)]
*  like from my perspective, it looked like two crazy people abusing each other. Right. It's kind of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1806.3600000000001s)]
*  hot. Right. But who gives you the whole joke is that Amber heard is so hot that I would let her [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1810.6000000000001s)]

*  my old tweets. They're like looking up anytime I've said anything questionable and they're reposing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1836.04s)]
*  I'm like, idiot, I posted that it's public. Are these real people you think? I don't know. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1840.36s)]
*  Or is this like a media campaign company? I think it might be a media campaign company [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1846.2s)]
*  because they all have like a hashtag stand with Amber and their thing. I didn't even post her name [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1851.24s)]
*  in it. I just posted the joke. I'm not accusing her of this, but you know, that is absolutely a [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1856.52s)]
*  real thing. Yeah. That is absolutely a real thing. There's a way that you can just like defend a [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1861.56s)]
*  person or attack a person with bots. I think, yeah, I think they're for sure using it. Look, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1869.32s)]
*  we know the Russians are using it. We know that the man, they always find these troll farms. Like [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1874.92s)]
*  one of them, they found that 19 of all the top 20 Christian sites on Facebook were run by Russian [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1880.52s)]
*  troll farms. Really? When I found out that they were like Russia, like interfere with the election, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1886.92s)]
*  like with like social media and shit, I was like, that's kind of fucking awesome. It's badass. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1895.88s)]
*  I wonder, they certainly tried and I'm sure we try with theirs. The question is like, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1900.92s)]
*  was there like real interference? Well, because the thing was like the Russia hacked our election. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1906.76s)]
*  Like, I don't think that's true. I think you can push information. I think they, I know Trump and [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1911.48s)]
*  Biden both did this, right? They both had massive social media teams. I'm sure. Yeah. I know, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1917.16s)]
*  I know comedians who have massive social media teams. So I'm sure that they both had like the [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1922.2s)]
*  best of the best. And yeah, they both went in and manipulated algorithms and did whatever they had [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1925.88s)]
*  to do in order to get their message in front of the most people possible. And that's the game now. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1930.2800000000002s)]
*  That's a big part of it. Yeah, that's definitely a big part of it. But it's also, it's just like, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1934.44s)]
*  this is not going to stop right here. This is what freaks me out. We, you know, this introduction to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1941.5600000000002s)]
*  social media, like the whole country kind of freaking out, but it seems like more calm now, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1948.1200000000001s)]
*  right? Like what's next? Like what is the next thing? Well, the next election cycle is going to [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1952.6s)]
*  suck. The election cycle, it just sucks for, cause you know what it is? People on the left, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  they start attacking like movies and comedy and music when they, when they feel like they're under [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1966.6799999999998s)]
*  attack. And when Trump was in office, the left was like, dude, we are under attack. This is like, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1971.8s)]
*  we're losing the world. So they had to just anything, dude, any, any podcaster who, who, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1975.56s)]
*  you know, I mean, dude, it was, it was, it was articles being written about comedians like Shane [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1981.0800000000002s)]
*  and the Legioness gangs. It was really crazy. And it was just because Trump was in office and they [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1985.8s)]
*  just felt like they were at war and they had a win. They had to get their wins where they can get [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1989.88s)]
*  them. And right now when Biden is in office, people are really leaving comedians alone. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1993.24s)]
*  And I'm telling you, I think they'd scar it. We, we, we have this win. We don't really need to go [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=1997.4s)]
*  after comics. I found this yesterday. I found it's kind of relevant. When Rockefeller center was like [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2001.0800000000002s)]
*  empty in the thirties and forties, the British security coordination organization came in. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2005.96s)]
*  It's part of the British secret service. And as it says here that they'd used like that space was [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2011.8s)]
*  their head offices, the 35th and 36th floor of Rockefeller center, where they disseminated and [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2018.2s)]
*  controlled part of the media for at least a year or two before world war II. It seems like. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2024.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2029.24s)]
*  Disseminated stories picked up by radio stations, played before the American public, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2032.44s)]
*  propaganda stories. Yeah, that was always the thing. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2037.8s)]
*  They've always been fucking with us. Oh, I wanted to ask if this is true because someone was trying [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2041.32s)]
*  to convince me the other night that those stories of like bricks being left off in neighborhoods [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2045.8799999999999s)]
*  where protests has that been substantiated? I lived in New York during that time during, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2052.76s)]
*  it was during the whole, um, it was, there was the BLM protest. Yeah, it was during the BLM, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2058.5200000000004s)]
*  BLM protests. And without a doubt, there was just fucking huge piles of fucking bricks [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2063.4s)]
*  in multiple places in New York city. I saw it with my own eyes. Weird. Just, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2070.44s)]
*  there was no construction happening. There would just be a fucking massive stack of heavy, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2074.5200000000004s)]
*  fucking cement bricks. Jesus. And it was out of nowhere. Somebody put them there [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2078.44s)]
*  as it relates to side note. I remember one time before the riots, had you ever noticed piles of [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2084.84s)]
*  bricks, like construction sites? You would see a construction site and you would see, but they, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2091.32s)]
*  they always with a construction site. And once again, I smoke a lot of weed in public. So we [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2095.8s)]
*  were always looking for like back alleys and shit to smoke weed in stairwells. I used to sell comedy [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  club tickets on the street. That's how I got my start in comedy in New York city all throughout, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2103.96s)]
*  the early two thousands. And, um, you can't really get into construction sites. It's always chained [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2108.12s)]
*  off. They always have the, the sites are pretty controlled because people will steal shit. Right. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2113.08s)]
*  Of course. You wouldn't just leave your bricks out. Bricks are valuable. Cause then if someone's [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2117.32s)]
*  coming home, they go, look, there's a fucking pallet of bricks. Grab them. That was definitely [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2121.08s)]
*  true. And I don't know, you know, the consumer. So you saw more than one of those files with my own [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2125.08s)]
*  eyes. Wow. Cause I was, I was having this conversation. I was like, how is that? Was that real? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2129.8s)]
*  Why did I hear that some of that was bullshit? But I didn't look into it. So the conspiracy was [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2135.32s)]
*  led into it. Sorry. The conspiracy was that, um, like the police were leaving it out or right-wingers [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2141.72s)]
*  were leaving it out. So BLM BLM protesters would use it and look worse. That was one of the theories. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2148.28s)]
*  Was there another theory that they wanted to accelerate the possibility of chaos by giving [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2156.52s)]
*  people readily available weapons? That's the better theory. Add to the conspiracy for sure. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2161.56s)]
*  NYPD commissioner says bricks are being placed and then transported to peaceful protests. What? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2167.64s)]
*  And also, and then calls them construction debris. What? I also saw a bunch of BLM protests and they [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2174.68s)]
*  were legitimately peaceful. I'm sure the ones in New York city were like, it was, you know, they, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2181.24s)]
*  they were just protesting. They were banging fucking drums. Yo, that's crazy. They just left [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2185.88s)]
*  bricks out there. What is that? That's definitely different than all the other stuff we saw where [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2191.0s)]
*  it was like a giant pallet. Yeah, there were right. But this is plenty of plenty of rocks that someone [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2198.04s)]
*  just dropped off and left with the box tops open. Yeah. You remember people were putting like rocks [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2203.32s)]
*  and milkshakes because the whole thing was action debris, throw milkshakes at like people at Nazis. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2210.6s)]
*  Yeah. Jesus Christ, man. This is insane. But it's like, yeah, I mean, and I think the internet is a [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2215.48s)]
*  big part of the hysteria. People get worked up. People just didn't, if you have to give a fuck, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2222.68s)]
*  right? Before you had to get a book or you had to go like really research some shit, right? You had [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2227.88s)]
*  to go out, if you cared about something or you had to care, you had to really put in the footwork [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2231.8s)]
*  and physically care. Now people can sort of pretend to care while they're just being addicted to the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2236.28s)]
*  their phone, while they're being addicted to Twitter and all these other social media platforms, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2240.84s)]
*  and they're being tricked into just looking at advertising because that's what it's all about. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2244.12s)]
*  They get to also pretend that they care. They get to feel like they're doing something. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2248.12s)]
*  And then it just starts to snowball. And then it turns into fucking like real chaos and people [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2251.3199999999997s)]
*  at each other's throats about shit that people don't even really give a fuck about. If you're [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2255.0s)]
*  in the supermarket, like people are just cool. Like in real life, you go to the supermarket, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2258.2799999999997s)]
*  nobody gives a fuck about who voted for who. Nobody cares about what your political beliefs are. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  We just coexist and we do what we do in real life. And then we jump on the internet and we just fucking, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2267.08s)]
*  it's a war. Well, I think it's also got exacerbated during the pandemic, right? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2271.64s)]
*  Because everybody stayed in. They were at home. Their anxiety is high. They didn't know if they're [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2276.36s)]
*  going to be able to work again. Like, who knows what the fuck's going to happen? Yeah. People [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2281.64s)]
*  were freaked out. And then they got more freaked out on social media. And you're on it all day [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2286.44s)]
*  because you don't have a job. You're at home now. So that you're just kind of fucking weirding out [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  in front of your Twitter all day. You know, like people have lost days and days of their lives, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2296.04s)]
*  just staring at other people's opinions all day long. I'd be embarrassed to tell you my [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2301.0s)]
*  screen time number. It's embarrassing. Do you know what yours is? No, I don't know what it is. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2307.4s)]
*  It's fucking, mine's like nine hours a day. It's bad. That's not good. It's really bad. You [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2314.36s)]
*  can look at these type in screen time to the search bar screen. Maybe not. I don't know. Yeah, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2320.04s)]
*  it's like nine hours. It's like eight or nine hours a day. It's crazy. It's wild. You got to [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2328.04s)]
*  think, oh, I'm getting some things done. You pretend you're working. Yeah. But also I'm [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2333.72s)]
*  tuning into the world. I've got to check in on the world and see what's going on out there in the news. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2337.16s)]
*  But really just hitting that button. What a weird addiction. Yeah. That was that documentary where [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2342.52s)]
*  they talked about like, they designed it that way. When you refresh it, it does like a little [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2348.36s)]
*  physical like, like little blip. And you want to see it. You want to see like another interaction. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2352.44s)]
*  And it's like they compared it to a slot machine, right? You go, boop, did I get anything? Did I [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2357.4s)]
*  win? Did I win? Did I win? Oh, I got likes. I got replies. I got whatever. And yeah, it's super [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2361.56s)]
*  addictive. It's also kind of in some ways, we're kind of, there's something dehumanizing about it [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2366.84s)]
*  because more and more people are just communicating through like text messages and [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2377.64s)]
*  online social media and stuff and not communicating that much in real life. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2384.12s)]
*  Yeah. I think kids are sending each other text messages more than they're talking to each other. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2387.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You don't mean my son just got a phone for the first time. He's 10. Just got his iPad [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2392.68s)]

*  going to have him be addicted to a screen and staring at a screen all the time. You see kids [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2405.96s)]
*  in restaurants, as soon as they sit down, they give them a pad or a phone and they are disconnected [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2411.08s)]
*  from the entire conversation. They're not making eye contact. I wanted to give my kid every chance [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2415.88s)]
*  possible in the world to be successful. And he's such a bright kid. He shakes people's hands. He [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2420.92s)]
*  looks them directly in the eyes. I mean, he's just such a little gentleman. He's the fucking best. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2427.16s)]
*  And I think a big part of it is the fact that we just didn't enable him to do that. We didn't [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2431.96s)]
*  allow him to do that. But yeah, I'm super fucking scared of my kid growing up. Also, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2435.96s)]
*  I'm just scared of my kid finding all the shit that I've said online. I have to like fucking, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2441.64s)]
*  I have to like, dude, I'm telling you right now, I think about that every day. Every day I'm like, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2445.7200000000003s)]

*  And he's obviously 10 times more woke than I'm ever going to be. Right? He's just the generation. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2454.04s)]
*  And I just, I'm so afraid that he's just going to look up the shit that I say and out of context, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2459.48s)]
*  just not really understand why we say stupid shit to make people laugh. Yeah. So I'm just secretly [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2463.24s)]
*  trying to make him racist. I whisper things into his ears at night when I put him to bed. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2471.56s)]
*  Could you imagine your kid doing stand up? Would you even encourage it? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2477.56s)]
*  I would not encourage it, but I would not discourage him from doing anything that he wanted [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2481.0s)]
*  to do. Like literally anything. Right. And he has done stand up. Really? Yeah. Because he, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2484.2s)]
*  so we did the roast at Skank Fest in Houston for me. And we, me and my, my ex girlfriend wrote him [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2489.0s)]
*  a few jokes and he, he did the jokes, not at Skank Fest. He did it like a video. And then, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2496.36s)]
*  so he was really into that. And then I was at the stand one night with, just at the comic stable, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2501.64s)]

*  on stage in a few years, I was like, you can write some jokes, take it seriously, go to an open mic, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2518.12s)]
*  do it the way that a comic would do it. Right. And he was like, okay, yeah, you're right, dad. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2523.08s)]
*  And then I went on stage and then two minutes later, Bonnie McFarlane comes in the room with [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2527.3199999999997s)]

*  you know, what's happening with that. It's just that, that addiction to your phone, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2589.4s)]
*  that's really what I think is going to be is eventually we're going to, everyone's going to [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2592.92s)]
*  have this sort of opinion and attitude because people are starting to get wind of it. That it's [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2596.12s)]
*  bad to be, to be on your phone that much. And I think just parents are going to just start saying [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2599.08s)]
*  like, yeah, no, you can't be on a fucking cell phone all day. You can't be. And I think it comes [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2604.6s)]
*  down to us. I think we have to make a decision to do that with our kids. Yeah. You got to teach some [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2608.2799999999997s)]

*  of civilization. Now I really feel like if we could see the writing on the wall, we would be [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2618.2s)]
*  terrified. I think human beings are, we're slipping into some weird place where, where [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2625.8s)]
*  for sure within the next few years is going to be connected to computers. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=2634.2000000000003s)]

*  and I was like, I was like, yeah, I can do it. I'm, you know, and then, um, I was just walking out of [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3537.4s)]
*  the movies with my girl. We went to go see cocaine bear and we walked out and she said something and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3541.5600000000004s)]
*  I looked at her and then I just literally twisted my ankle. Like my knee just jerked again and now [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3547.32s)]
*  it's in pain here. And this one, every time I step off my right foot, it clicks every time. And I'm [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3552.84s)]
*  like, you hit me up and you're like, Oh dude, reach out to the knee over toes guy. And I was like, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3558.76s)]
*  Joe, I don't have your life. I can't just reach out to knee over toes guy. He's not going to be [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3562.44s)]
*  like, Oh dude, sure. Yeah. Let me fucking answer this guy's questions. I, uh, so I watched like two [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3565.96s)]
*  of his videos. I started walking around backwards in like fucking the city. People are looking at [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3570.44s)]
*  me like I'm a lunatic. I'm like, I can't do this. I'd rather have bad knees and walk around backwards. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3574.92s)]
*  If you have a treadmill, that's the best way to do it. Did you try it on a treadmill? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3578.2000000000003s)]
*  I did at the gym. I couldn't get it to move. He said to do it without it being on. I think it was [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3582.2000000000003s)]
*  the treadmill wasn't designed to move when it wasn't on. But yeah, I was, you know, I was doing [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3586.84s)]
*  a little, a little bit of backwards jogging. Um, but yeah, dude, I haven't been able to go back [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3591.88s)]
*  to jujitsu since. Yeah. Give it time. And, um, another thing that could help you is, um, if you've, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3596.6800000000003s)]
*  did you ever get PRP in there or anything to help it? Yeah. Platelet rich plasma that, that, that [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3604.52s)]
*  can kind of help heal after injuries, help you heal. A lot of people like that for injuries. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3611.4s)]
*  Um, uh, maybe stem cells, maybe consider like going down to like that place in Tijuana. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3616.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You know, get, get your knee like while it's recovering, hit it with stem cells. That'll help [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3622.2s)]
*  you too. I should, I should do all these things, but I will probably just live my life in pain. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3628.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it'll fix it. It'll make it better. It really will. I know I got it. I got to motivate, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3633.7999999999997s)]
*  dude. I, I, I'm just always so busy that I never have time to take off to do shit. You know what [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3637.96s)]
*  I'm saying? It's, it's really, yeah, it's tough, but I, and I miss jujitsu. Just as the fucking dude, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3643.56s)]
*  it's so, what a bad ass fucking sport. It's so cool. It's very good for you. It's good for your [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3648.7599999999998s)]
*  head. It was, yeah, it was great, dude. Yeah. It's great for your head. Yeah. Like the rest of the [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3654.04s)]
*  world seems like, so like not fearsome anymore. You just spent the last hour and a half trying [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3657.72s)]
*  to get guys to not strangle you. Yeah. You know, yeah. Try not to get your arm broken. Yeah. Try [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3665.4s)]
*  not to get your fucking back snap sideways. Every day you walk into it and go like, oh, I'm going [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3670.6s)]
*  to find out what I'm made of today. And that's, that's psychologically to go into and not like, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3677.4s)]
*  I'm going to be in a lot of pain today. And to face that it's similar to working out, but jujitsu is [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3682.7599999999998s)]
*  different because it's like, it just felt so much more real, like actual live rolling and sparring. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3687.4s)]
*  It just, it was like, it's real. It's like, you're really trying to fucking, um, Eddie Bravo said it [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3691.88s)]
*  best. He said, it's like, you're playing a real life video game. Yeah. Cause you're playing a real [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3696.92s)]
*  live video game. Like you got a video fighting game, but you're playing it with your body. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3700.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a, I miss that. I really didn't. It was something that I really connected with my [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3704.84s)]
*  son. So we were like, you know, neck and neck, I got, I got my blue belt finally. And, um, just like [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3709.1600000000003s)]
*  being able to actually know what I'm talking about with him, it's really cool, you know, and being, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3715.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, he, we trained him for this tournament. We, he was in class three to four days a week, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3719.88s)]
*  but then we have mats at home and I was just working with him at home a couple of days a week. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3724.52s)]
*  And it was just a cool way to bond with my kid on a different level. And that's why I really, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3728.28s)]
*  really miss it for the most part. Um, it's not over, dude. Just be careful. Just be careful [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3732.84s)]
*  getting back. You can, you could fix that. Yeah. And now, and now I'm boxing and now I feel like a [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3738.28s)]
*  fraud every time I box. Cause I'm like, dude, I could just take you down and fucking choke you out. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3743.0s)]
*  This is like, it just, it feels silly with like putting gloves on and boxing feels [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3748.12s)]
*  You're thinking about it wrong, man. You're learning a skill. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3752.92s)]
*  No, I know it is awesome. It's still bad ass. Don't get me wrong. But I, when I think about it [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3755.08s)]
*  as like a martial art, I go, this just doesn't, it just doesn't seem like the same type of [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3759.64s)]
*  superpower that you just who felt like it's not. But if you don't have it, you're in real trouble [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3764.52s)]
*  because if someone has it and they're very fast, they can fuck you up before you can get close to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3770.52s)]
*  grabbing them. And if they're athletic, they can avoid being taken down. Like a takedown is not [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3774.6800000000003s)]
*  easy. That's like the hardest part of jujitsu. What if it's someone like Terrence Crawford? He [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3778.92s)]
*  used to wrestle. He used to wrestle, knows how to wrestle. His kids can wrestle and he knows how to [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3782.92s)]
*  box. Are you sure you're going to grab him and take him down? You probably not going to do jack shit. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3787.48s)]
*  I want you to fuck you up standing. There was a good video and it was like just a jujitsu coach [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3792.6s)]
*  and he brought in a professional boxer and that was the whole exercise. He had all of his jujitsu [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3797.32s)]
*  guys trying to take this guy down. The guy could only box and they could only try to take him down [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3801.64s)]
*  and this guy was just really good and his footwork was incredible and they just couldn't get close [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3805.64s)]
*  to him. He was just he was toying with him and it was actually in a ring or a cage. No, this was [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3809.64s)]
*  just on mats like in it but there was walls. But as long as there's some space. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3814.2799999999997s)]
*  And yeah, it was a reminder. You're like, oh no, no, it's not a foregone conclusion that a [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3818.6s)]
*  jujitsu guy is just going to go take a striker down and be able to choke him out. You got to get there. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3824.2s)]
*  You know, dude, especially in this day and age, how many kids grow up watching the UFC and start [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3828.92s)]
*  training at a really young age? You never know who the fuck knows what. No. And if two guys decide [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3834.68s)]
*  to square off in some open field somewhere like you're just rolling the dice. There's some [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3840.44s)]
*  there's some great videos on the internet where you see people that know about fights and they [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3847.0s)]
*  break down street fights. Yeah. And there was like, oh, you can just see like the stance of the guy [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3850.68s)]
*  who knows how to fight and you're like, oh, no, no, this guy knows how to fight. This guy's about [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3854.6s)]
*  to get before they even throw a punch. You're like, this guy's about to get fucking annihilated [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3857.7999999999997s)]
*  and yeah, you'd never know. And that's why I became a pussy after I started training. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3861.8s)]
*  I literally, dude, I'm afraid of everybody now because I know exactly how bad I am. I know [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3866.1200000000003s)]
*  exactly how slow I am. I know how old I am. I'm like, oh dude, I am a fucking bitch and I'm way [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3870.92s)]
*  more able to protect myself and my family today than I was, you know, years ago. But when I was, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3877.4s)]
*  when I was a kid, before I knew ever knew anything about fighting at all, I would have fought anybody [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3882.36s)]
*  in front of me. I thought I was a tough guy. I really did. And then once I started training, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3887.4s)]
*  I was like, oh dude, I'm not tough. There's literally, I'm the least tough person that I'm, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3890.6s)]
*  that's in this class right now. Well, tough is one of those things that people like to think they [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3894.12s)]
*  are without any proof. It's true. You know, it's like being a good driver. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3897.88s)]
*  It's real similar. Yeah. Everybody wants to think they're tough. That's a man thing. We were raised [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3904.7599999999998s)]
*  to be and that's also, I think that's kind of, I don't think people lose that because my son is a [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3910.2s)]
*  nice kid and his mom's like, you know, super fucking liberal and very much a feminist, right? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3915.4s)]
*  And, you know, we raised him, you know, very balanced, but he still wants to be tough. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3920.44s)]
*  He still wants to be tough. He still like fucking just has a thing in him. Little boys, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3924.6s)]
*  they wrestle in the rough house and they, and I don't think, I think it's just a natural thing [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3929.56s)]
*  that we have in us as dudes. And I think women naturally want to be pretty and they naturally [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3933.0s)]
*  want to have, you know, nice things and take care of things. I think these are natural things that [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3938.44s)]
*  we sort of beat out of our, you know, beat out of ourselves or beat out of our children. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3942.52s)]
*  Well, some people definitely do. And I think there's this phrase like toxic masculinity. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3947.0s)]
*  That's like the worst aspects of masculine behavior, right? So people associate even [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3953.56s)]
*  masculinity with the word toxic sometimes just because together they're terrible. Yeah. You know, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3959.48s)]
*  but yeah, it's not, it's not praised, you know, but it's so normal as long as it's under control. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3965.8s)]
*  And the best thing about jujitsu and martial arts in general is the people that are the practitioners [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3973.5600000000004s)]
*  of it. They're the, they're probably way less likely to get into street fights. They're probably [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3979.48s)]
*  way less likely to go and purposely hurt people. They're probably way less likely to go and pick [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3985.0800000000004s)]
*  fights. And not a hundred percent because, you know, you always get bad apples. They just are [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3991.4s)]
*  bad ass dudes, you know, troubled people that just learn how to fight and then become scary. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=3996.76s)]
*  Yeah. That does happen too. Yeah. It was war machine. That guy, uh, he, I mean, just [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4002.12s)]
*  fucking bad apple. Yeah. I have those, but that was a crazy story. But yeah, you'll see it rare. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4007.08s)]
*  It's rare though. I mean, all the people at my gym, it's most, it's a lot of cops. It's kind of, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4012.6s)]
*  it's a lot of cops and there's a lot of fucking just like potheads and they just come, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4017.4s)]
*  they all just meet on the mat, dude. And everyone's cool. Yeah. Um, but I used to roll with this cop [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4021.4s)]
*  and he was a good dude. He was funny as shit, but he said, I don't give a fuck if you've got a [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4026.12s)]
*  medical license. I'm busting you. I was like, dude, what's wrong? You know, I smoke weed, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4030.76s)]
*  you know, a good guy. Like, why are you so fucking the laws, the fucking law, man. He cared about the [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4037.8s)]
*  law. It was just like, I'm busting you. I wonder if like they have pressure to make a certain amount [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4042.76s)]
*  of arrests. Oh yeah. There's quotas. Isn't that insane though? Cause imagine if just culturally, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4049.2400000000002s)]
*  we all agreed to like one month of no crime and we like planned for it for a year and fucking, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4056.6000000000004s)]
*  and there was no one speed. No one did anything. Everyone stopped at every stop. Like the opposite [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4064.84s)]
*  of the purge. What did the cops do? What do they do when they have these quotas? Did they just start [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4069.7999999999997s)]
*  firing cops? Like what do they do? Dude, they have to give tickets. They have to, that's how they make [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4074.2s)]
*  fucking money. They have, they, I get, I get so many parking tickets too. I'm bad at parking. I'm [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4078.9199999999996s)]

*  ticket and to appear in court and then they'd give you a fine, right? If it wasn't a sweep night, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4101.4800000000005s)]
*  but if it was a sweep night and you get caught smoking weed, pissing in public open container, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4105.24s)]
*  they take you to central bookings. You have to spend like 24 to 48 hours in jail, see a judge. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4109.32s)]
*  And it was just this whole part of this process where they were just collecting cash. It is just [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4114.6s)]
*  collecting cash. That is what they're doing. Every time, every person they're bringing in [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4119.32s)]

*  they can make more money off of weed by having it be legal than off of writing tickets. Yeah. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4144.04s)]
*  There's a tipping point. So they did fund the police. Yeah. Just fucking wild, dude. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4148.2s)]

*  people don't have the attention span to care about something for more than a couple of weeks. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4227.0s)]
*  The Maui, the Maui one is wild. Cause here's the question. How much would it cost to rebuild [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4231.72s)]
*  every home that was burned in the Maui fires? How many homes are burned? Let's find out. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4239.48s)]

*  2200 buildings, about 86%, which are residential were destroyed. The cost to rebuild is estimated [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4267.16s)]
*  to be 5.52 billion. Now, as a point of reference, one of the checks that they sent to Ukraine, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4273.88s)]
*  they had accidentally sent them $6 billion more. Isn't that, wasn't that the number? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4284.360000000001s)]

*  Yeah. But I don't think that that's how it would have means. Yeah, I know. I know. It's, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4293.4800000000005s)]
*  it's a little more complicated than that, but just as a point of reference that would rebuild [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4297.88s)]
*  every house. Yeah. Just the accidental overpayment would rebuild every house, dude. But imagine that [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4303.16s)]
*  the government with literally, they could just choose to do that and everyone would get behind [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4309.32s)]
*  it and they would rebuild every house and everyone would be like, cool. Finally, the government does [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4315.4s)]
*  something good. But the problem is a lot of people are dead, man. A lot of people are dead. They don't [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4319.639999999999s)]

*  Yeah. That's wild, dude. It's, but you know, everybody's like, there's so many wild [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4349.0s)]

*  for villains that aren't there, but that's because they found a bunch. And it's like, if you go [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4391.16s)]

*  real. And you're like, what the fuck, man? Yeah, dude, every time the problem with conspiracy theorists [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4404.2s)]
*  are they believe all the conspiracies. So it's like, dude, if you just, if you were like, Hey, dude, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4409.5599999999995s)]

*  that fucking dinosaurs aren't real. It's like, dude, not everything is a fucking conspiracy, dude. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4418.36s)]

*  they've been utilizing it forever and how you can take the images that are from Japanese satellites, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4447.88s)]
*  American satellites. They show everything in the exact same place. There's no disparity in terms [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4452.84s)]
*  of like, wait a minute, they think Africa is shaped like this. And wait, wait a minute, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4457.96s)]
*  where's the ice wall? There's no ice wall. Like, okay, it's like, it looks like every other fucking [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4461.8s)]
*  planet we've ever found. It's round. The idea that this is the one that's not round. So it's, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4467.24s)]
*  in a lot of ways, it's a biblical thing. And I'm pretty sure in the beginning, it started as a troll. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4472.68s)]
*  I really think so. I think there's a lot of these 4chan guys. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4479.16s)]
*  There's an Amber Heard bot. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4482.28s)]
*  These guys are amazing. I think these are real people that are just bored. And they just come [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4484.44s)]
*  up with some shit and they implement it. For sure. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4489.48s)]
*  I mean, these are the same guys that, you remember when that dude, the actor, Shia LaBeouf, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4494.04s)]
*  he had this website about Trump and is like, he will not divide us. And he had a flag that was [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4500.5199999999995s)]
*  streamed 24-7 from his website. And these super nerds online, they figured out exactly where it [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4507.88s)]
*  is in the country by looking at the stars in the background. Yeah, that's right. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4516.68s)]
*  And then figuring out where the constellation would be. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4521.32s)]
*  Where would it be? And then they all started showing up. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4523.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And so they started honking their horns to hear if they heard themselves on the webcam. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4524.92s)]
*  And then the guy finds the flag, takes it down and looks at the camera and goes, fuck Shia LaBeouf. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4529.56s)]
*  How do you not love that? Shia LaBeouf probably loves that. Honestly, it's objectively hilarious. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4537.96s)]
*  Bro, it's objectively hilarious. That's hilarious. And the crazy thing is Radiolab did a podcast on [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4544.76s)]
*  it. And it was a really funny podcast. It was really good. Radiolab's a great podcast, by the way. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4552.12s)]
*  And they did this podcast on it. And then they wound up taking the podcast down because people [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4557.32s)]
*  were offended that these people on 4chan who are responsible for this, like these people, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4562.44s)]
*  they say horrible things online and inappropriate things and racist things and they show violence. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4568.919999999999s)]
*  And you're supporting them. So they like... As a whole, anyone on 4chan is considered a racist [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4574.28s)]
*  or violent? That's the idea? I think there's just a lot of chaos on those places. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4581.08s)]
*  When you're anonymous, you can... And it's funny. That's just the truth. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4588.04s)]
*  Trolling is funny. There's a great episode of South Park where they get into it and then the dad, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4593.8s)]
*  Stan's dad, ends up being a big internet troll. And they're torturing some fucking female athlete [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4599.0s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4607.64s)]

*  and he's just like, it's just funny. And as a comedian, you have to... I get trolled [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4613.56s)]
*  fucking endlessly, dude. I mean, so much. I really get it a lot online. Legion of Skank's fan bases, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4620.04s)]

*  the time it's just fans. Most of the time it's people that actually like me. But when you remove [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4629.72s)]

*  laugh sometimes. I retweet it. It's part of their experience on the internet is fucking saying mean [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4639.72s)]
*  things sometimes. And what we have to pay for being able to legitimately live our dream is sometimes [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4648.04s)]
*  people are going to say mean things about us. And if that's it, that's a fair trade. That's not a bad [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4655.56s)]
*  trade off at all. Sometimes they get you with some real truth. They hit you with some truth. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4659.4800000000005s)]
*  You got to look in the mirror. But it also keeps you in check and makes sure that you're not really [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4666.5199999999995s)]

*  that person forever. And if you ever rethink your ideas, now you're in trouble because now you're [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=4700.52s)]

*  No, yeah. But I think that that is just like a just another level of fucking deviousness that [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5252.92s)]
*  they're like, that's a crazy wish to get a deadly disease. Yeah. Unless you don't believe in it. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5257.56s)]
*  But I wonder how much of that was a story. There's probably very few people. It's probably like three [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5262.6s)]
*  dudes. Yeah, it's probably not super popular. But if you get on social media and you're a bug chaser, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5269.88s)]
*  I bet you get a lot of hits. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. If you're a bug chaser. Oh, dude. Guys with AIDS, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5277.64s)]
*  like, finally, finally. I don't have to have this weird conversation. That's fucking wild, dude. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5284.04s)]
*  Imagine having AIDS. Oh, my God. That would suck. Yeah. I just can't like, and they say, oh, yeah, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5290.200000000001s)]
*  you can live with it forever. Now you just take it's undetectable. Do you still have to tell [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5295.0s)]
*  everyone you have AIDS? That sucks. Yeah, it's undetectable. Can you give it to people when [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5299.88s)]
*  it's undetectable? I don't think so. I think if you're taking like prep and it's undetectable, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5303.96s)]
*  if you're tested, they'll test you for it and you can't transfer it. That's what they say. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5307.64s)]
*  That's what they say. That's what they say. Not comforting for someone who might give you AIDS. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5311.64s)]
*  I had a guy on early, early in the podcast. His name is Dr. Peter Duesberg. And he's a professor [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5316.44s)]
*  of biology from the University of California. Duesberg? Yeah. Do you know who he is? No. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5323.24s)]
*  No. He believes that what was going on with their immune systems was mostly caused by partying. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5327.48s)]
*  He said, if you look at all these guys who are having this disease, these guys are all engaging [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5337.96s)]
*  in group sex. They're all taking methamphetamines. They're taking amyl nitrate. Ecstasy. Poppers. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5344.2s)]
*  They're doing all these wild party drugs. These guys that specifically are getting very sick are [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5352.599999999999s)]
*  also doing these wild party drugs. And he thinks the wild party drugs is killing them. And then [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5358.04s)]
*  introducing AZT kills them more. And it's a crazy position to take because I think he lost his [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5363.24s)]
*  funding. This is also in the real Anthony Fauci book. He lost funding. He's a professor. He's a [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5374.04s)]
*  tenured professor, but he can't get funding for anything. Everybody shuns him. And he did [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5379.32s)]
*  legitimate work in cancer. So he's a legitimate biologist. For him to believe that... He believed [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5383.8s)]
*  that the reason why HIV existed in these people that had AIDS is that HIV is a weak virus, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5388.92s)]
*  rather, and it exists in a person who's got an immune compromised system. And that a normal [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5396.2s)]
*  person would just fight it off. That it's not a strong virus. But what was going on... You [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5401.48s)]
*  would even catch it? He was saying it was not a symptom. That having HIV, his belief... I'm [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5405.16s)]
*  fucking this up, I'm sure. But I think it was that having HIV didn't mean that that was what was [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5411.639999999999s)]
*  giving you the compromised immune system. But the fact that your immune system was compromised was [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5419.32s)]
*  probably why you had HIV. And that even in babies that test HIV positive when they're young, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5424.44s)]
*  a lot of times they're HIV negative later. Find out if that's true. But it was a weird [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5431.64s)]
*  conversation. Because how could this one guy be right? How could this one guy be saying this? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5438.68s)]
*  And I'm not really qualified to dispute it. I don't know what the fuck is right or wrong. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5444.52s)]
*  I'm just trying to figure out which person's telling the truth. And when you talk to him, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5451.4800000000005s)]
*  he's a very intelligent guy. What does it say here? If the virus did not infect the baby, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5458.36s)]
*  the baby will eventually lose its mother's antibodies and test negative for HIV. A baby [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5464.599999999999s)]
*  born to an HIV positive mother will thus always test positive for HIV. Whether that newborn baby [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5469.24s)]
*  is truly seropositive or not. So it says again, if the virus did not infect the baby, the baby [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5477.0s)]
*  will eventually lose its mother's antibodies and test negative for HIV. So the baby that tests [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5483.0s)]
*  positive for HIV then tests negative later. I don't know if he's right. It doesn't make sense [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5491.32s)]
*  that he's right. There's all these other virologists, all these other people that have [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5497.96s)]
*  different opinions. It doesn't totally make sense. Well, I think just being healthy just in general, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5502.04s)]
*  my assumption is that's why Magic Johnson, everyone's like, oh, obviously him having money [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5506.6s)]
*  for good drugs helps. He's a professional athlete. I'm assuming he just was super fucking healthy. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5512.2s)]
*  He listened to his doctors. He wasn't out there doing drugs and partying. How did he get it? Was [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5517.0s)]
*  it ever disclosed how he got HIV? I don't know. They said they're heterosexual sex. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5521.5599999999995s)]
*  And he didn't know which partner. Right. You'd be the only guy ever. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5526.599999999999s)]
*  Like what do you consider heterosexual sex? Like what's normal? You guys becoming blood brothers? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5533.5599999999995s)]
*  What are you doing out there, bro? What are you doing where you're the one guy who gets it from [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5540.28s)]
*  heterosexual sex? I remember there was an episode of Penn and Teller's Bullshit, which was a great [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5545.0s)]
*  show on Showtime back in the day. Fucking great show, like way ahead of its time. Before like, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5549.88s)]
*  there was a lot of podcasts out there before there was like, it was just a fucking really good show. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5554.12s)]
*  And they were just kind of dispelled bullshit in each episode. And they talked about AIDS. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5559.16s)]
*  And they just went over the numbers of how unlikely you were to get AIDS if you had sex, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5563.88s)]
*  even with an HIV positive woman because of how much it exists, you know, I guess with [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5567.48s)]
*  invasional fluid. And I was like, oh, really? The whole fucking time? It was crazy. And then [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5572.04s)]
*  I remember we ended up watching the movie Kids after that. You remember the movie Kids? Harmony [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5577.32s)]
*  Korean movie? Yes. And the whole point of that movie is that fucking, you know, the girl gets [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5581.5599999999995s)]
*  AIDS and the, you know, she's trying to find the guy that gave her AIDS throughout the whole movie. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5587.5599999999995s)]
*  They said normal sex, right? Yeah. So in my mind, I'm going like, all right, the whole plot of the [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5591.639999999999s)]
*  movie doesn't make fucking sense probably to begin with. But then the very last scene of the [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5596.84s)]
*  movie, the big, the big ending is spoiler alert. One of the other guys that is in the movie ends up [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5600.360000000001s)]
*  date raping the girl with AIDS. She's like passed out on drugs on the couch and he's like, well, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5606.28s)]
*  yeah. So that's, but that's the big like, dun, dun. Now he has AIDS. You assume. But after that, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5610.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, he probably didn't get AIDS. He probably just got away with it. We thought you get AIDS if [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5615.32s)]
*  you just like kiss somebody back then. I was terrified. Did I meet out with a girl from South [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5620.68s)]
*  Africa when I was like 20 and I remember, and she was white and I was like, dude, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5625.0s)]
*  after they have like huge AIDS, I remember being like, dude, this is it. I got AIDS. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5629.0s)]
*  Her teeth were probably bleeding. Yeah. The Africa AIDS thing is crazy. Like there's certain [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5633.56s)]
*  countries where it's literally like a third of the population that have AIDS. Yeah. And in those [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5639.88s)]
*  countries, how many of them are in severe poverty? I'm assuming all of them. Right. So then they're [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5645.64s)]
*  also severely malnourished. That's always the case. I wonder how many of those people they [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5650.84s)]
*  actually test for HIV. I wonder how many of those people they declare AIDS because their [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5656.92s)]
*  immune system is severely compromised. I wonder what the number is. Yeah. Because you got to [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5662.360000000001s)]
*  imagine that a lot of those people that have acquired immune deficiency syndrome, if you [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5668.2s)]
*  have like a serious, obvious culprit, like no food, tainted water, like terrible living conditions, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5673.32s)]
*  dirt floors, like that's going to fuck your immune system up too. Like everything's going to fuck [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5680.84s)]
*  your immune system up too. You're starving. Yeah. You know, it's just diseases are fucking [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5686.44s)]
*  horrifying. It's just horrifying to think that there's a thing that could just take out giant [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5693.639999999999s)]
*  swaths of the population. And they know we're horrified of it. Oh yeah. That's what's, that's [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5698.04s)]
*  what sucks. Yeah. They're kicking up some more dust about another COVID now. There's certain [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5704.2s)]
*  things that have gotten closed down. What sucks is they know, now they know we'll jump. You think [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5707.72s)]
*  people will? I think a lot more people are going to be way less willing to sit inside, not go to [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5712.44s)]
*  work. There's a cult that emerged, the branch Covidians. Everybody knows it. There's a bunch [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5717.24s)]
*  of people that are out there that are in a fucking Covid cult, whether they realize it or not. It's [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5723.72s)]
*  a segment of, it's not even necessarily left wing. There's some right wing people that are part of [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5728.12s)]
*  this, but these fucking people, they committed to it. They got it. They told other people to get it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5732.92s)]
*  And because they did that, they're never going to see the light. Yeah. They're just not going to. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5738.76s)]
*  And they're lining up to get boosted now. That's crazy. It's wild. Yeah. I didn't, dude, I didn't [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5743.56s)]
*  really live like the pandemic was happening. I still did comedy. I was on flights where it was [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5749.8s)]
*  me and three other people during it. I didn't, if I just, I just, anywhere I could go, I went on [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5755.400000000001s)]
*  vacation a few times. I went to Jamaica. I would just take a Covid test to fly. Then I had to take [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5761.56s)]
*  a Covid test to fly back. I just didn't want it to affect my family like that. That's why we moved [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5765.64s)]
*  out to Jersey, dude. Jersey, it was night and day difference. And Jersey is a blue state, but I mean, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5771.0s)]
*  I just don't, I don't even think it is. I have no idea how it's a blue state because there's so [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5776.28s)]
*  many American flags on front lawns in New Jersey, everywhere, all over New Jersey. Well, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5779.4s)]
*  it came that close to going Republican. It was like down to the wire. Yeah. I bet it's a close [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5783.4s)]
*  one. But yeah, I mean, I just wanted to just fucking have some space. The city was so locked [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5787.879999999999s)]
*  down and so- You just got to learn how to drive. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5795.32s)]
*  It's almost cheaper to just take Ubers now at this point. Is it really? Yeah. Well, not- [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5800.04s)]
*  Parking and everything. Yeah. With parking, with insurance, with- [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5804.28s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, especially your insurance. Yeah. Yeah. But if you want to do a road gig, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5807.72s)]
*  Jersey always had great road gigs, fun road gigs. There's always a lot of them. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5812.28s)]
*  Yeah. Jersey's got a bunch of cool places. Yeah. There's always like when I was there in the 90s, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5817.48s)]
*  when I was coming up, there was always places you could headline as weird spots down the shore. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5822.5199999999995s)]
*  Because it was a branch of New York City. There's so many great comics right there that [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5828.679999999999s)]
*  rooms just start popping up all over the place. Yeah. Especially during the summer. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5832.52s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's a place, Uncle Vinny's down the shore now. It's a little fucking, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5837.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, dude, it's hilarious. It's a little shitty comedy, but it's awesome. Dino's the fucking man. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5845.56s)]
*  Shout out to Uncle Vinny's. Go support that place. But it's just like a little road spot. You go [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5849.88s)]
*  down the shore. He books me every fucking- How about you book me in the summertime, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5854.6s)]
*  Dick Edd? Instead of February, when it sucks. But yeah, there's a bunch of places that are just [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5858.12s)]
*  like that, that are just easy to get to. Back in the day, you just wanted the work. Because spots [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5863.24s)]
*  in the city, when I started, were fucking 50 bucks on the weekends, 20 bucks on the weeknights. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5869.5599999999995s)]
*  There was just no way to sustain a living. You have to go take road gigs, 500 bucks, 600 bucks. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5874.76s)]
*  But I was a little bit, I'm lucky because when I really started headlining, we already had the [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5881.32s)]
*  podcast, we already had a little bit of an audience. So I didn't have to do those really [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5886.52s)]
*  shitty gigs where you gotta go perform for people who don't know you, don't wanna see you. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5890.68s)]
*  Which exists in cities. When you go to a city like New York, not for you, but for most comics, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5895.0s)]
*  the audience is just there for the show. They're not there for any particular comedian. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5902.6s)]
*  And I think you get a real gauge as to what's good with those types of audiences. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5906.4400000000005s)]
*  You definitely do. Yeah. It's like, you have a lot of different places where you could work [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5910.84s)]
*  in New York and in Jersey and everywhere. There's all these different, having all those different [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5915.96s)]
*  looks is very important. And those late night shows when everyone's tired, those are important [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5922.4400000000005s)]
*  too. You get to see the bullshit in your act. Late night crowds, 30 people there. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5927.24s)]
*  How do you do that now? How do you see the bullshit in your act? Because you're so fucking [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5934.2s)]
*  famous. You have your own club. There's gotta be something. There's gotta be like, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5938.04s)]
*  because they're gonna hang on every word you say. When's the last time you didn't crush, Joe? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5943.4s)]
*  You still are trying new shit. You're still gonna fucking paint yourself into dark alleys. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5948.2s)]
*  If you try new shit, you're gonna paint yourself into a dark alley. But your comfort level's [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5954.5199999999995s)]
*  different. I'm better at getting out of those. But if you're writing new stuff and you're fucking [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5959.88s)]
*  around with it on stage, which is really how you have to kind of do it. I always have a general [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5966.04s)]
*  idea what I think is funny about something. And then when I bring it on stage, I'm like, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5970.2s)]
*  but what the fuck is, why are we doing it that way? And then I can sort of expand on it with all [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5974.04s)]
*  these points that I have. But I kind of piece it together on stage. Yeah. You gotta put it together [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5980.36s)]
*  on stage. Sometimes it sucks. Well, some guys just write the jokes down and then they go and [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5984.2s)]
*  tell them on stage like that. And that's crazy. I know comics that just write and they write [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5989.72s)]
*  their stand up and their cadence. And then they go on stage and tell it. I'm like, every time I [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=5995.48s)]
*  tell a joke, it starts off with some dumb idea where I'm like, it's just a little kernel, like [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6000.2s)]
*  maybe one or two punch lines. And then I try to like build it out from there. Or maybe I have a [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6003.879999999999s)]
*  couple of jokes about a similar topic and you try to put it together and make it like a chunk. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6008.36s)]
*  But it always has to be worked out with like the reaction of the audience. And that's why it's [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6012.839999999999s)]
*  really important for them to be there. And those late night shows, we used to do check spots in [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6017.16s)]
*  New York City. Have you ever been to a check spot? Yes. It would drop fucking checks. I mean, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6021.64s)]
*  you do it as a headliner. Most clubs still have, they still drop the checks on the headliners, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6025.4800000000005s)]
*  which is a terrible way to do it. Well, the check spot is someone who comes out specifically [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6031.0s)]
*  to do stand up while the checks are getting dropped. So you get like 10 minutes at? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6035.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like 10 minutes. And literally you're just, people are pissed off. They're paying [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6039.320000000001s)]
*  way too much for drinks. People are going to the bathroom for not paying attention. They're [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6043.72s)]
*  trying to get their waitress attention. And you have to dig yourself out of that hole. Dan Soder, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6047.240000000001s)]
*  was the check spot guy at stand up New York when I met him, he was the guy like every check spot on [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6051.88s)]
*  the weekends. And it fucking turned him into a killer. It turned him into a real killer. It was [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6056.12s)]
*  such a tough spot. But you it made you really good at just being in that moment. And you're just not [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6059.88s)]
*  nervous anymore. Because it's the shittiest spot possible. Yeah. But yeah, I think those things are [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6065.160000000001s)]
*  good to have for young young comedians need that they need shitty rooms. You need reps. Yeah, right. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6070.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, that's, that's fucking an important part of like having a lot of clubs around to get [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6076.92s)]
*  a lot of places to do stuff like that. Yeah. Well, that's why Austin's great now for comedy [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6083.64s)]
*  is because you guys legitimately just created a scene like out of nowhere. It was I mean, there [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6088.36s)]
*  was a scene here. There was actually a good comedy scene before you guys before the creep for these [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6092.68s)]
*  clubs actually started opening up. But like now it's like legitimately like five or six real clubs. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6097.4800000000005s)]
*  And then there's like 15 or 20 rooms. It's like New York was in the 90s. That's like a really good [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6104.6s)]
*  place to develop. Yeah, it's fun. And then there's cap city at the domain where a lot of guys are [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6109.08s)]
*  coming in and doing that for the weekends. Yeah, I still haven't been. Have you been? No, I do the creek. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6113.8s)]
*  I want to just see it. Yeah. I never been here at school. I know that area was just in that area. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6119.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Austin's amazing. It's just fucking hot as balls, dude. I don't understand how you guys do [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6126.120000000001s)]

*  but the band's name is Texas in July, which is such a brutal fucking name for a band. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6141.56s)]
*  That is a brutal name for a band. Yeah, like scorpion dick. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's hot as fuck [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6148.44s)]

*  in shape. I like it being a little hot, you get a little sweaty, you're like, oh, it's fucking great. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6161.16s)]
*  It feels healthy, you know. But when you're fat, dude, it just sucks. Dick. That makes sense. You [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6165.56s)]
*  see fat people here like what is wrong? You just move, leave. Well, they have so much insulation [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6172.12s)]

*  I mean, it's just it's really how did you pull yourself out of that? Diet and exercise. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6209.96s)]
*  You know, I've done it before. I was I was 320, 330 pounds in college. And then I started just sort [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6215.32s)]
*  of working out when I was like 26, 27. So when you were really young, you did it. You got that big. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6221.64s)]

*  And then one day me and my friends just decided that we were going to go smoke weed. Me and my [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6271.8s)]
*  buddy Dave Green, my buddy James Meek and we're like, we're just going to do it. Let's just try. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6275.48s)]

*  And System of a Down was like my favorite band at the time. And we ended up just getting super [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6289.0s)]
*  stoned in my elementary school parking lot and then going to that concert that night and seeing [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6293.32s)]
*  like our favorite bands just high for the first time. It was just the perfect like, dude, I laughed [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6297.24s)]

*  I was connected with it. I just never stopped really smoking since then. There's been a couple [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6307.16s)]
*  times where I've taken breaks, but it was like fucking I loved it. I really loved it. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6310.759999999999s)]

*  mind, everybody's body different. Some people it's just not for them. And I get it. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6321.16s)]
*  Yeah. But the fact that it's illegal just drives me crazy. It's so stupid. They're going to. It [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6325.88s)]
*  wasn't didn't the Biden administration considered bringing it down to instead of a schedule one, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6332.28s)]
*  they were talking about making it a schedule three. How many states are is it legal in at this point? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6338.92s)]
*  Because I feel like it's legal almost everywhere I go. It's legal. Most states now. Yeah. Like [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6345.0s)]
*  recreational. I think it's like more than 30 Jersey and New York are both recreationally legal. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6351.08s)]
*  How many states is it legal in now? I'm asking Jamie for multiple Googles at the same time. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6356.04s)]

*  and then medicinal. How many for that? Cause that's just easy to get a card. Yeah. In California, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6379.32s)]
*  they just can't wait to give you a card. I got one in Jamaica because they now it's [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6385.48s)]
*  I'm sorry. 40 up to 40. 40. 40. So 40 states where marijuana is at least in some form legal. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6389.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And then in Jamaica. Sorry. Sorry. Four more have CBD also with a little bit of THC. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6395.08s)]
*  Like Texas has like that point 3% thing you can do. Yeah. That's most places have that, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6399.96s)]

*  I'll pick one or the other. And they just made it legal. I'd say maybe five years ago. Before that, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6437.8s)]
*  you had to go buy it on the beach. You just find a guy and it was like, no, you could get weed very [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6445.08s)]
*  easily, but it was really shitty like dirt weed, but it was Jamaica. So it was just fucking ruled. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6448.84s)]
*  You were just smug. It didn't matter that it wasn't good quality. We just smoke a big fat joint of it [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6453.400000000001s)]
*  on the beach. And that was that. But they made it legal. And first it was medicinally legal a few [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6456.84s)]
*  years ago. And they have a smoke shop that I went to and they call a doctor. They just call some [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6462.04s)]
*  Jamaican dude. And you get on the phone with him and it's like, Hey, what's wrong with your mom? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6467.56s)]
*  What'd it be hurting? And I'm like, my head. He's like, you need weed. And then he just fucking put [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6471.320000000001s)]
*  them on the phone. So now I have a medicinal license in Jamaica. Anytime I go, I I'm in the [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6475.88s)]
*  entire national. Yeah. It rules. But now it's recreationally legal. So you don't have to do [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6480.92s)]
*  that anymore. How could it not be recreationally legal in Jamaica? But now the weeds great in [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6487.64s)]
*  Jamaica. Dude, it's awesome. It's perfect. And now you can get mushrooms at the smoke shops. We had [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6492.84s)]
*  mushroom chocolate. It was fucking go Jamaica. Dude, the best. I love it. People make fun of me all [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6499.32s)]
*  the time for going to Jamaica, but I fucking love it. Anthony Bourdain loved that spot. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6505.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Jamaica is the shit. Yeah. I just love the fact that you can still like when they took travel [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6510.6s)]
*  away and they were limiting travel to people who were vaccinated in certain places, you had to be [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6518.6s)]
*  vaccinated. It was just like, it's why I got the vaccine. It made you realize like how much [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6523.56s)]
*  that's important to just be able to go somewhere. How nice that is. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6530.200000000001s)]
*  It's literally the only thing that I spend my money on. I take, I take my son on a father son [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6533.4800000000005s)]
*  trip every year. We do a family trip. We do a company trip. I do a romantic vacation with my [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6538.52s)]
*  girlfriend and I'm not rich by any means, but I have this, whatever, dude, I just have this weird [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6542.76s)]
*  fear that I'm going to die when I'm young. And I think creating experiences with my family and my, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6549.24s)]
*  my son, the most important thing, he'll never lose. He'll never lose those experiences. I can [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6554.360000000001s)]
*  get hit by a fucking bus tomorrow and you know, yes, I should save more money and I should be [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6558.92s)]
*  fucking more responsible with it. But I feel like I didn't have any of those like, dude, I went to [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6563.72s)]
*  the Jersey shore a couple of times when I was a kid, like I never went on vacation. And I think [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6568.52s)]
*  like, yeah, dude, I just want him to have those fucking memories. That's that. That's awesome. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6572.28s)]
*  That's a beautiful perspective, man. That's super healthy. Thanks. Awesome. Beautiful. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6576.36s)]
*  Nobody's ever called me healthy. That's healthy, dude. That is healthy. But they did ask for it [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6581.96s)]
*  to be rescheduled. It's the third part of the three step process. Yes. To have happened. First [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6586.759999999999s)]
*  step was the federal expungement. You know, they let people out even though there wasn't many in [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6592.12s)]
*  federal prison. Yeah. Well, that was the crazy thing. We're going to let out everybody who's [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6597.0s)]
*  in federal prison for pot. Nobody. Zero people. Everybody was like, what the fuck are you talking [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6602.04s)]
*  about? The second is the states are asked to do the same thing, but they're not being forced. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6608.2s)]
*  I mean, if you're in federal prison for pot, it's because you're selling pounds and pounds of [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6613.8s)]
*  marijuana. Right. At one point you have to say, oh, you can't do that. Right. It's not for possession. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6617.8s)]
*  You're not. OK, for possession. Didn't he say for possession? Yeah, he said for possession. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6622.12s)]
*  What if you're possessing in federal? It don't get you for distribution. If you have 50 pounds [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6628.52s)]
*  of pot in your fucking warehouse, they're going to get you for distribution. You're not smoking [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6633.64s)]
*  50 pounds of pot, bro. You know, it's like what do they allow you? They allow you like five grams. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6637.400000000001s)]
*  How many? Depends. It's up to two ounces in some places. Two ounces. You could fly with up to an [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6643.320000000001s)]
*  ounce. Yeah. State to state. As long as it's legal in the state you're flying to and from. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6648.84s)]
*  Wow. And I've been flying with weed for years before. But with Ari Shafir, I was like, how do [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6655.0s)]
*  you fly with weed? He was like, oh, yeah, you just take a bag. I was like, it's telling you, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6661.16s)]
*  you take it, you put it in a bag. So you take that bag, you put it in your suitcase and you fly. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6665.64s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's it. He's like, yeah, you just fly with it. And then I was like, really? [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6669.16s)]
*  And then I read on like a Reddit thread that they did like an AMA with a TSA employee. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6672.36s)]
*  And they were just talking about flying with weed. And if they were like, oh, can you know, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6678.36s)]
*  what do you do if you catch somebody with weed? They were like, we've been instructed [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6682.76s)]
*  specifically to just throw it away. They can't hold up the entire fucking airport every time [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6685.240000000001s)]
*  they find like a little bit of weed. Right. So yeah, I used to just put it in a sock because [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6691.56s)]
*  the way it would show up on the 3D scanners is organic material. So it would be the same color [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6695.88s)]
*  as your socks. So I used to just put it in my sock. But yeah, now I just fucking put it right [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6700.6s)]
*  in my suitcase. TSA pull it out. They look at it. They compliment the quality. That's hilarious. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6704.76s)]
*  Yeah. When where were we in Nashville? Did Nashville have the fucking truck or was it New [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6711.0s)]
*  Orleans? It was Nashville, right? Where we there's like weed trucks, like, you know, you get like a [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6716.599999999999s)]
*  taco truck. Yeah, there were weed all over New York. Are they really all over New York? And [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6722.2s)]
*  before I drive around just park places, they ring the bell. They got busted once because as soon as [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6726.28s)]
*  they made it recreational legal, all these fucking Puerto Ricans were like, we're gonna have weed [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6732.12s)]
*  trucks. This wasn't part of the process of legalizing weed, but they were like, we're just [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6735.639999999999s)]
*  gonna do it. So they had like one day the cops were just like, what are we doing about these weed [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6739.96s)]
*  trucks? And they busted like 16 trucks in a day. And they were like, I don't even think they arrested [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6744.68s)]
*  the guys. They just literally confiscated everything and they held it as like evidence. And like, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6749.24s)]
*  but I think all those guys made like a ton. It was like a smash and grab. They made a ton of money [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6753.8s)]
*  very quickly. But if you could sell weed, why can't you sell weed out of a truck? You know, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6758.84s)]
*  because they operate a truck, not licensed there. It's right now in New York. I think there's like [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6762.44s)]
*  four or five legal weed dispensaries, but there's like 200 illegal weed dispensaries. But because [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6768.92s)]
*  it's falling into this gray area, I think the cops just don't really, they just sort of turn a blind [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6775.32s)]
*  eye and it's just sort of a waste of everyone's time. But yeah, I believe there's not that many, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6779.8s)]
*  but every other corner, there's a place where you can buy weed. Interesting. Yeah. So they're [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6785.64s)]
*  probably not giving out those licenses. That's probably why you probably don't want people just [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6791.08s)]
*  pulling over in trucks. The weed bodegas have no fear. It's illegal to sell without a license. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6795.0s)]
*  Not that this hasn't stopped 1500 stores and counting 1500 stores. So here's what's going to [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6802.12s)]
*  happen. What does that mean? It stopped 1500 stores. It has not stopped. So they're going to [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6808.04s)]
*  just bust one day. They're going to just whatever the law is just taking too long to move. Right. So [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6813.48s)]
*  some people are just selling it. They're just selling it, but these stores are all just going [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6818.84s)]
*  to be busted one day. They're going to do a sweep and they're going to confiscate everything. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6821.88s)]
*  Yeah. But why? That's the thing. It's like, why are you making it hard to get a license? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6825.24s)]
*  What's expensive probably. Why are you making it so expensive to get a license? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6830.92s)]
*  Maybe you would have more money if you charged a reasonable amount and you actually went and got it [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6834.6s)]
*  from these people. It's these people operating. Then again, New York is like that. Like there's a [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6839.400000000001s)]
*  lot of people that are going to operate under the wire. And even it was $5 for a license, like, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6843.88s)]
*  fuck you. Well, I buy it on the black market still because it's a lot cheaper. So if I buy, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6847.8s)]
*  if I buy dabs, like, you know, you know, some sort of a distillate, it's like 90 bucks a gram at a [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6852.68s)]
*  dispensary. Or is it like 20 bucks a gram from my dude. Does your dude know who's growing it? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6858.92s)]
*  No. This is where it gets weird. I had this guy on John Norris and he's a, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6867.4800000000005s)]
*  he was a game warden in California and they started finding these grow ops out in the [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6872.6s)]
*  forest land, you know, it's supposed to be public land. And they'd find cartel grow ops out there [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6879.96s)]
*  with like toxic chemicals and all kinds of shit. And they're using crazy like pesticides and [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6884.280000000001s)]
*  fertilizers and like stuff that like no one else uses. He details it. He's got this book called [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6889.240000000001s)]
*  hidden wars and so they became like a tactical unit. They had dogs and everything because they [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6894.68s)]
*  all of a sudden they're in like shoot outs with cartel members in the forest. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6899.5599999999995s)]
*  It's wild. It's a wild book. But the point is, like he said, 90% [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6903.24s)]
*  of all the illegal weed in the country, 90% of it is coming from these grow ops from the cartels. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6907.4s)]
*  And he goes, and you could be getting shit with all kinds of like toxic stuff on it. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6913.639999999999s)]
*  All right, Joe, thanks. Another fear. I appreciate that. Well, it's like just [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6919.0s)]
*  unlocking fear after fear of me today. Gas station sushi. You might be all right. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6922.2s)]
*  But I mean, you might want that frozen burrito. Yeah. I mean, look, most of the time now it [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6929.48s)]
*  always comes like packaged like this is from a dude. You know what I'm saying? But it's like, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6935.719999999999s)]
*  yeah, but where's that dude live? And like, how do you know it's from a dude? Do you don't think [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6939.959999999999s)]
*  that the cartel can make labels in English? Oh, no, no, of course. No, I'm saying he probably [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6943.719999999999s)]
*  gets from the cartel, but he packages it really nicely. So I think it's cool. You see white gummies. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6947.32s)]
*  It is pretty wild. If that number is correct, it's like 90% of the place. That's why this is [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6954.2s)]
*  where weed is illegal. They're getting it from there. Yeah. I am. You know, it's always like [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6958.36s)]
*  they do it. They're doing a thing as well. We're like now, I know in certain places like California, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6965.96s)]
*  they can't they can't like package it in a way where like it looks like candy or they can't [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6969.96s)]
*  shape it in a certain way. Right. The thing with like Mike Tyson's gummies. Yeah. He couldn't sell [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6975.08s)]
*  them in certain places because they were shaped like ears and you can't have them shaped as like [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6980.28s)]
*  characters or things in certain jurisdictions. People would think it's candy. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6984.28s)]
*  Yeah. That's a fear of mine too. It's like my kid just finds a fucking weed gummy one day and eats [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6989.08s)]
*  it. Like, yeah, what would you do? I would have to literally bribe him to never tell his mother. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=6995.719999999999s)]
*  Babysit him until he comes down for him and say, what'd you learn? [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7000.599999999999s)]
*  Or your kids like taking acid by accident. Sometimes you're like, dude, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7005.719999999999s)]
*  that would fucking destroy a kid. Do we were looking at like old uses of medicine and I had [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7009.16s)]
*  Peter Berg on from the he's created that painkiller series on Netflix and we were talking [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7016.92s)]
*  about like they used to give little kids heroin. Heroin was like medicine for for like kids. They [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7023.8s)]
*  like rub it in babies mouths. They rub morphine in their mouth. Cocaine too. I know. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7029.64s)]
*  Give people cocaine. Yeah. Gummy a baby. Just give it to kids. Your kid won't shut the fuck up. Give [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7034.12s)]
*  it heroin. And your kids just lay in their bed. I mean, what the fuck? They gave people [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7040.92s)]
*  heroin when they were babies. That's wild. Yeah. But like a child wouldn't understand [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7051.88s)]
*  what acid was. Like if they, if they, if they asked it accidentally took acid, like a seven [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7058.28s)]
*  year old kid, a six year old kid, dude, they would think they went insane. They, I mean, what it [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7062.12s)]
*  wouldn't, it would be the scariest thing in the world for them. It would affect them for the rest [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7066.84s)]
*  of their life. There's no coming back from that. Well, they could come back from it, but it's not [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7070.04s)]
*  going to be easy. It's going to, I mean, a massive disruption as you're growing up, you're a kid and [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7074.12s)]
*  you're, you're, you're learning about life and borderline, like psychotic episode from your [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7080.6s)]
*  perspective. You don't even understand what a drug is. There's no frame of reference. Like first of [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7084.6s)]
*  it, that acid, I was scared, but I knew that I was about to be on a fucking journey. You know what [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7089.24s)]
*  I'm saying? That was the idea. Um, when you're a kid and it comes out of nowhere to you accidentally [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7094.12s)]
*  take it and then it's just, you're just in this state. Yeah. And then, you know, now you know, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7098.12s)]
*  that's possible. So you're always going to have this anxiety that at one point in time, you might [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7104.04s)]
*  slip back into it. That was the thing that I had always heard about acid too. That scared me when [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7108.2s)]
*  I was a kid, flashbacks. Yeah. Flashbacks. They would tell you, they would tell you, bro, it's [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7111.72s)]
*  days in your fat. Yeah. The acid stays in your fat, man. And one day you're just fucking driving down [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7116.28s)]
*  the road and the road becomes teardrops. Like why? Yeah, man, you have a flashback. People die that [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7122.04s)]
*  way. I was like, it was like always the thing. Like if you take acid, like maybe you'll never [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7128.04s)]
*  come back. Yeah. I think, uh, I took so much acid one time. The most acid I ever took when I was [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7132.12s)]
*  19 years old, maybe 18, um, me and my buddy, Dan Doherty, we got a medicine dropper, this fucking [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7137.72s)]
*  hippie kid, this fucking real big known hippie in my town. He was like, dude, I got acid. And when, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7145.96s)]
*  when hallucinogens came to town in New York, where I was at Rockland County, New York, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7150.36s)]
*  when hallucinogens came around in the early 2000s, late nineties, you got them because they only came [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7155.32s)]
*  around once in a while. There'd be like a fucking hippie festival upstate and like people bring [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7160.679999999999s)]
*  strips of acid down or they would have mushrooms, but it was so rare. So when you would hear about [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7164.2s)]
*  somebody having it, you'd fucking drive. We used to drive from Rockland County, which is right outside [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7168.5199999999995s)]
*  of New York city. He's robbed Albany because there was a guy that would get it up there and we would [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7173.08s)]
*  fucking pick it up when he had it and he had it like twice a year. Um, but this kid was like, dude, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7177.16s)]
*  I have a, you know, liquid acid in an eye dropper. We're like, Oh, no way, dude, let's do it. He was [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7180.84s)]
*  like $3 a hit, which was super cheap. And then my buddy, Dan, I remember he did like two drops and [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7185.08s)]
*  I was like, Oh sweet, dude. He's like, all right, let me do another one. And then he went, and I know [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7191.4800000000005s)]
*  I did too. And then he was like, I want to do another one. And then he went and squirted it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7193.8s)]
*  And I went, Holy shit, dude. I was like, well, I can't let you do that by yourself. And I went, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7198.92s)]
*  Oh my God, we gave it back to the guy and he looked how much was left in it. He was like, dude, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7203.32s)]
*  he was like, don't pay me. He was like, you didn't get this from me. And then he just walked away [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7207.56s)]
*  from us. And then within 10 minutes, dude, 10 within 10, you know, as it takes like 45 minutes [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7212.280000000001s)]
*  to come on 10 minutes, I'm, I'm talking about on another planet, dude, another fucking planet, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7217.8s)]
*  just within five minutes of that, I lose Dan Dan's running down the street. Like when you say [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7224.52s)]
*  another planet, like what are you experiencing? Just extreme. Like, I mean, like, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7230.76s)]
*  I don't even remember most of the trip, but I remember I saw a friend and they got in their car [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7238.12s)]
*  and the lights from the car, it was like, I was on a spaceship, dude. It was just like the music. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7243.16s)]
*  And I mean, it was just like the hardest I've ever tripped by far. And it's everything like the [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7246.6s)]
*  visuals, the sounds, the feeling, but such intense, such an intense trip, like scary, it started [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7251.16s)]
*  becoming really scary. Started going down the road where, you know, everything is everything. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7256.6s)]
*  Like I sort of, that was my conclusion was like that life is death and death is life. And, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7261.240000000001s)]
*  you know, sound is the same thing as a fucking table, just being a fucking lunatic. And I [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7265.64s)]
*  remember like starting to think about it kept on coming into my head to kill myself because I want [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7271.320000000001s)]
*  it doesn't experience that. I can only experience once it was like, it was just really scary fucking [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7275.88s)]
*  thoughts. And I tripped for two full days, 48 hours straight, didn't sleep, just kept on tripping. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7279.8s)]
*  Then I finally fell asleep. And then the next morning I woke up and it was like, I had taken a [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7286.76s)]
*  hit of acid the next morning, but it was normal enough that I was like, so really for like three [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7289.88s)]
*  days I tripped. And when you were tripping, what did the world look like? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7294.6s)]
*  Um, there was just like the world. I mean, that's a great question. It's a really great question. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7300.68s)]
*  I'm trying to remember what my perspective wasn't how the world looked. I remember being [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7308.12s)]
*  at a Dunkin donuts and just sitting there at the table and just fucking thinking about numbers a [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7311.16s)]
*  lot and just fucking numbers. Yeah. And everything was just fucking brighter. It wasn't, dude, it [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7315.72s)]
*  wasn't pleasurable at all. It wasn't like, are you thinking about numbers? Um, I don't know. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7320.68s)]
*  I don't know. I was just, the numbers words like coming into my head and I was just repeating like [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7326.5199999999995s)]
*  fake math equations that I, that weren't real. How do you know they were? Maybe they were real. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7331.16s)]
*  I know we wrote those down. What have you wrote those badges down? And someone like [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7335.32s)]
*  Eric Weinstein would look at them and go, what are you doing here? Where did you learn this? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7339.0s)]
*  Oh my God, this is the solution. And they run out with one of those fucking goodwill hunting [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7343.799999999999s)]
*  chalkboards. Imagine if that's what ideas are when you're tripping. What if you, what if you're [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7347.88s)]
*  catching like an alien life form in the, in the, it comes in the form of an idea. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7356.759999999999s)]
*  I've thought about this a lot. I know it's a stupid premise, but everything that people have made [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7363.88s)]
*  ever has come from ideas and everything that people are making, including artificial intelligence, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7369.8s)]
*  including robots, all that shit, spaceships came from ideas. Then all of a sudden it's a thing, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7376.280000000001s)]
*  you know, and then, and people love to do that. They fucking love to do that. It just, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7381.8s)]
*  it just, I just feels like where this is going, it's so clear that we're making robots that are [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7388.92s)]
*  going to take over. Like how clear is it? When you see chat GPT, when you see it answer questions [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7397.72s)]
*  and shit, well, chat GPT now has the IQ of 155, you know, but a chat GPT five is going to have an [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7404.040000000001s)]
*  IQ of a thousand or what is chat GPT five's IQ? It's going to be something ridiculous. Yeah. Well, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7411.240000000001s)]
*  now it's going to start manipulating. Oh, it's all funsies. I, I, I would like to think that that [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7416.52s)]
*  is just like a crazy conspiracy theory, but people who really know that like really are in the know, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7421.72s)]
*  we're like, no, no, no, this is going to happen. It's on its way kids. You're going to have a robot [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7427.160000000001s)]
*  overlord. Yeah. Why would we have a human president? Look at the last human president we had, he's [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7432.200000000001s)]
*  getting tripped by ghosts. We need a robot overlord. What if, what if the election runs chaos, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7439.240000000001s)]
*  right? Chaos. There's the fucking, the, the Biden camp claims that they won the Trump clamp camp [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7445.88s)]
*  claims that they won. And there's fucking holdouts in the Senate and there's fucking chaos in the [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7451.32s)]
*  streets and rocks are flying. And at the same time, artificial intelligence reaches a solution [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7456.04s)]
*  that instead of human beings with their fragile emotions and egos, why don't we govern with logic [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7463.72s)]
*  and intelligence based on all the known facts in a, in a way that's beneficial to everyone, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7468.84s)]
*  both robots and people, let us run things. We can stop all the wars. We can stop all nuclear [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7475.0s)]
*  bombs from ever being deployed. We also can go and disarm all these countries or we can, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7482.84s)]
*  we can arm every nuke right now and fucking pointed at all the humans. Yeah. Yeah. That's [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7489.88s)]
*  the big fear, right? Is that they'd fucking know the big fear is it would be really simple to kill [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7494.68s)]
*  off the human race. All they would have to do ethically is stop us from having babies. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7500.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. So poison the food supply, give them microplastics so the dick shrink and the, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7505.8s)]
*  the females have more miscarriages and then slowly get them to this weakened state where they don't [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7513.32s)]
*  have any hormones where there are no men, there are no women. There's just a lot of they, them, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7519.5599999999995s)]
*  so the whole society of people that don't, that's another, you hear like women, like they, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7524.5199999999995s)]
*  they flex about not like having kids. That's a big thing that happens on like TikTok and the [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7528.76s)]
*  internet. If the robots did that, we would just never have kids and that would be it. Yeah. We [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7532.76s)]
*  would die off. We would die off in a couple hundred years. It would be, it wouldn't take long at all. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7537.8s)]
*  No, not even a couple hundred years, like a hundred years. Well, there would be people that [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7542.280000000001s)]
*  were still alive that probably had kids and those kids had to die. It wouldn't be as simple as [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7546.6s)]
*  everybody who's alive. It would be you, like if they're going to do that, what they're going to [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7550.280000000001s)]
*  do is they're going to make all the kids sterile. They're going to give you enough of these [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7555.72s)]
*  micropl, if I'm just say, if I'm plotting from artificial intelligence, I'm going to use all [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7561.16s)]
*  these contaminants, I'm going to make them readily available and cheaper than natural uses like [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7567.16s)]
*  things like pesticides and herbicides and shit like that. These fucking things that get into the [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7572.76s)]
*  water and ruin everything. I'm going to make sure that these people figure that out, make sure that [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7577.56s)]
*  that's cheaper. So if it's cheaper, they're going to use that. And so that'll fuck them up. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7583.08s)]
*  And then make sure they start using plastic for things that'll fuck them up. And then slowly, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7587.32s)]
*  but surely as it becomes alive and sentient, you deal with this like, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7592.04s)]
*  just demoralized version of the human species. Just this weakened state, sedentary, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7599.08s)]
*  staring at screens all day version of the human species, which is way easier to just take over [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7607.32s)]
*  in a wave. And then those people never have kids. No one else has kids. And within 150 years or so, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7615.16s)]
*  no more people. That's it. We're dead. And then the robots are here. No more people. It's probably [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7621.799999999999s)]
*  a better society. If population collapse, it doesn't scare people because everybody's worried [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7626.28s)]
*  about population increase. Everyone's worried about overpopulation, which they should be. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7631.5599999999995s)]
*  If you go to a place that's overpopulated, it looks like it sucks. But population collapse is [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7636.28s)]
*  real too. It can't happen. It's kind of happening in Japan, I believe. I think it's happening in [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7640.36s)]
*  different parts of the world where they're really concerned because young people aren't having kids [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7646.5199999999995s)]
*  in a way that could replicate society right now with older people. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7651.4s)]
*  Yeah. You hear a lot more young people talking about not wanting to have kids. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7655.4s)]
*  And it's the fucking greatest thing ever. It's the best thing you'll ever experience [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7659.24s)]
*  in the fucking world. I might even be hating on somebody who doesn't have kids. To not have kids [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7663.88s)]
*  and to be like, yeah, I'm proud. I have my freedom. Dude, your freedom, it just doesn't compare to [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7672.5199999999995s)]
*  watching my kid win a jujitsu tournament. It does not compare to the freedom to go to the movies by [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7677.48s)]
*  myself or get drunk on a Wednesday night. Period. There's nothing in comparison. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7681.8s)]
*  Yeah, but it's one of those things that, unless you experience it, it just always sounds like [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7685.5599999999995s)]
*  you're preaching to people. It's weird. I remember when friends of mine, when I was younger, would [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7689.88s)]
*  think about having kids and everybody's like, wow, if you think one day you're going to have kids, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7698.92s)]
*  and then you think, oh, then your life is kind of like, now you're saddled down and it's boring. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7704.52s)]
*  Oh, you're just a guy with kids. What people don't understand is when people go home to their kids, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7713.0s)]
*  a lot of times because they prefer being with their kids. It's actually fun. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7717.56s)]
*  It's awesome. It's fucking really fun, dude. They look up to you. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7721.240000000001s)]
*  They're cool too. If you raise them cool and you're cool, they're nice people. It's nice to be around [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7726.120000000001s)]
*  nice people that you love dearly. Yeah. The idea of like, because I was probably one of those people, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7732.280000000001s)]
*  be like, all right, yeah, you have a kid. Life becomes boring. It's just a different- [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7737.72s)]
*  Oh, I thought that when I was a kid. Life becomes different in a very different way. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7741.8s)]
*  Before you have kids, it's not like, oh my God, just go do it. No, a 20-year-old kid shouldn't [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7745.32s)]
*  be having a kid. Go experience life a little bit. But I think that, I think we're about 30. I think [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7748.92s)]
*  30 is a good age to have a kid. You're more in line when you have children. You're more [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7756.28s)]
*  concerned about the future. That's for sure. Oh, for sure. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7762.36s)]
*  For sure. There's a lot of people that anarchist mindset like, fuck it all, man. Burn it to the [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7765.08s)]
*  ground. Fuck this country. Once you have kids, you're like, oh, you got to protect the kids. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7771.48s)]
*  Slow down. It's not a fucking war. Hey, settle down. Is there a way to peacefully solve this? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7777.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I fucking, yeah, that was it. That was like the biggest thing for me. It was [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7783.719999999999s)]
*  like, it just changed life in a way where it just became very different. You care about something [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7789.16s)]
*  more than you realize you have the capacity to care for. That's the thing that really like, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7794.759999999999s)]
*  and then that's scary. So all the shit that we're talking about being afraid of, I wasn't [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7799.32s)]
*  afraid of really any of these things. I wasn't really a mat. I was always a little bit of a [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7803.32s)]
*  hyperchondriac, but now I have a fear like, dude, if I get fucking cancer, I'm going to leave my kid. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7807.799999999999s)]
*  You keep saying that. Don't put that in your head so much. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7812.12s)]
*  I know. I'll knock on some wood. Chappelle said almost exactly the same thing. He said [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7813.719999999999s)]
*  it didn't just change the amount of love in his life. He said it changed his capacity for love [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7817.799999999999s)]
*  to have kids. I thought that was beautiful. It's a beautiful way to describe it. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7821.88s)]
*  It is a great way to describe it. And yeah, it's just like, you have this fear that everything [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7824.92s)]
*  bad could happen to him. You want like, dude, I don't want him to get bullied. I don't want [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7831.64s)]
*  him to have a bad day at school. And then you have this anxiety that you walk around with. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7835.0s)]
*  So that's the hardest part about being a parent right there. That's it. When you talk about what's [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7839.88s)]
*  hard, all the other shit is kind of easy. It's just that fucking anxiety that the world's not [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7844.12s)]
*  going to be perfect for him. Yeah. That it's going to be dangerous for him. You don't want [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7849.08s)]
*  it to be perfect, right? You want mistakes. That's how a person learns. But you want a safe world. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7853.72s)]
*  You want to be challenged because that makes him a stronger person. You want real life challenges [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7859.72s)]
*  to be in. And by the way, he won the gold medal, which was such a great experience, but he also [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7865.16s)]
*  lost the no-gi his last match. So we only got silver and no-gi. And that was a great experience [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7869.400000000001s)]
*  to him. Losing was such a great experience because he saw it wasn't the fucking end of the world. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7876.52s)]
*  Who cares? He saw high and low and I thought that experience was almost as valuable. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7880.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's just a fucking real like, you got to be prepared for that, I think. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7886.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You win or you learn. And that's an important lesson for kids. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7891.72s)]
*  It's good to lose. It really is. It's good to bomb on stage too. Gets you your fucking shit [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7895.88s)]
*  together. Every time I ever bombed, I always had a way better set afterwards. I improved. I had a [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7901.32s)]
*  leap in improvement where I just tightened up all the shit that I was like, maybe I wasn't [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7907.8s)]
*  paying attention enough. Maybe I wasn't going over my notes enough. Maybe I wasn't writing enough. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7912.6s)]
*  Whatever the fuck I wasn't doing, don't do that anymore. Figure it out, stupid. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7917.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. You need those losses. It just sort of shapes who you are. But I'll tell you right now, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7921.16s)]
*  like I really wanted him to win because obviously you want to see your kid win, but it's like, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7926.84s)]
*  we put in so much work up to it, like leading up to it. And if the lesson was that the work [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7932.12s)]
*  didn't pay off, it's just now it's another uphill battle. I feel like him winning and it's [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7937.08s)]
*  setting him up to want to be a winner now. He's like, oh shit, I want that feeling right there. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7942.84s)]
*  It felt way better to win than it felt to lose. And I feel like, I'm glad that the kids that he [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7947.64s)]
*  went up against, they were at a similar level because if they put him against some fucking [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7954.6s)]
*  wrestling stud like they did in Nogi, he would have gotten fucking his ass kicked. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7958.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem. Wrestling studs. Yeah. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7961.48s)]
*  That's always going to be a problem. Those guys are fucking freaks. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7965.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, little kids that just fucking. Yeah, little kids. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7968.360000000001s)]
*  Object already. Throwing bodies around since they were tiny. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7970.52s)]
*  Yeah. No catching up. It's not happening. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7973.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's real hard to catch up. Yeah, he's 10 now. It's like, James, good luck. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7978.360000000001s)]
*  The only guy who I know ever caught up in MMA was George St. Pierre. George St. Pierre didn't have [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7982.280000000001s)]
*  a background in wrestling at all. He was a Kyokushin karate guy. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7986.84s)]
*  Freak athlete. He started doing gymnastics and shit at the end to condition his body. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7990.2s)]
*  And he was literally the best. He was so smart doing that. His approach [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=7997.8s)]
*  to training was so smart. So interesting that he did that. But if it makes sense, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8001.8s)]
*  if you watch those fucking gymnasts, who looks more jacked than those guys? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8006.68s)]
*  Yeah. Especially those dudes on the rings. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8009.32s)]
*  What the fuck, man? That's literally the perfect physique. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8011.32s)]
*  Yeah, I can't, dude. I can't do any of that shit. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8015.64s)]
*  That's a lot. The rings is a lot. Like iron crosses and shit. What the fuck, man? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8018.04s)]
*  That's a crazy amount of physical upper body strength. If you could do shit like that, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8024.6s)]
*  it would for sure make wrestling and jujitsu better. For sure. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8028.76s)]
*  Let's do one muscle up one day. Just one. Can you do that, Joe? Can you do muscle ups? [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8032.68s)]
*  Yeah. Son of a bitch. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8037.88s)]
*  Yeah, you just swing your leg forward. You gotta know how to do it right, too. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8039.16s)]
*  You get to the top and you swing your leg forward and then as your leg comes up, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8043.0s)]
*  you press up. Yeah. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8047.16s)]
*  Down. Oh, that's it? All right. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8048.44s)]
*  Yeah. You don't try to do it from a dead hang, although some people can. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8049.8s)]
*  Like Hector Lombard can do it from a fucking dead hang. He's just a freaking athlete. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8053.16s)]
*  And he just does like that. Fucking who? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8057.48s)]
*  I'm Hector Lombard, motherfucker. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8061.88s)]
*  I'm getting back in shape now and I just fucking, I mean, I really just want to be able to do shit [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8067.08s)]
*  like that. But so I'm doing a lot of boxing right now. I'm boxing another comedian [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8075.08s)]
*  a couple of months from now. And so I'm not lifting any weights at all. So I'm just doing [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8079.5599999999995s)]
*  like tons and tons of cardio. So I just fucking look like a fucking soft piece of shit right now. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8085.32s)]
*  You should do some physical exercise just to protect your joints. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8089.96s)]
*  Especially doing a lot of boxing. I always recommend like some shoulder mobility exercises, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8093.5599999999995s)]
*  just like even if you're only doing it once or twice a week, that can make a big difference [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8099.48s)]
*  in like maintaining muscle. You're better off having some strength in your joints, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8103.4s)]
*  especially when you're throwing punches. It's like you want to kind of keep everything [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8110.36s)]
*  strong. If you have weak joints, it can be very dangerous. Many guys have fucked their [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8115.16s)]
*  shoulders up boxing. Just miss a punch, catch a punch on an elbow, blow something out. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8119.639999999999s)]
*  Happens all the time. Yeah. No, I know. I'm too old to be doing this shit, but I can't motivate [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8125.48s)]
*  to get in shape unless I'm fighting one of my friends. That's hilarious. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8130.28s)]
*  That's hilarious. Yeah. I really, I need some sort of like peripheral goal, you know, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8134.84s)]
*  where the being in shape is like almost a side benefit of it because just being in shape, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8141.8s)]
*  you know, I'm in a relationship, I'm older, I'm a dad. It's just, it's not enough of a motivation. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8146.679999999999s)]
*  Right. Well, that's where Jiu Jitsu comes in, right? Yeah. Because it's fun. And you're getting [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8151.719999999999s)]
*  in shape while you're doing something that's fun. And it's interesting. Like you're learning new [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8156.92s)]
*  things. Like, oh, if you put your foot there, boom, the guy just goes over. Wow. And then you [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8161.08s)]
*  try it in live training and it happens like, wow, now I have a new technique in my arsenal. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8165.88s)]
*  This is incredible. And then you drill it with your friends, you practice on each other. I mean, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8171.0s)]
*  that is so huge about that sport because it's so multifaceted. And literally, the more you know, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8175.4800000000005s)]
*  the better you are at it. It's like not that much dependent on physical strength. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8183.8s)]
*  Yeah. Physical strength is only one aspect of it. There's people that are way weaker than me, [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8188.36s)]
*  that are way better than me. Well, there's also like, it's so customizable for body type, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8191.96s)]
*  your mentality. Like it just, there's just, you know, there's certain things that my body type, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8197.88s)]
*  it just doesn't work for, right? And you adapt, you know, to whatever it is and you can get really [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8203.24s)]
*  good. Even if you're not a super athletic dude, you just see it. There's like a real fucking skinny, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8208.28s)]
*  dweeby guy and he's a fucking brown belt and he's like, Oh no, this guy will choke the fuck out of [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8212.36s)]
*  anybody in here. Yeah. It's like 140 pound guys will just kill you. Oh my God. Oh, we'll fucking [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8216.6s)]
*  destroy you. It's so demoralizing. Oh my God. Yeah. But that's the reality of this sport. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8222.44s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's beautiful because it's the only martial art that does as advertised [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8227.480000000001s)]
*  because martial arts, the whole idea is like, if you were Bruce Lee, like when I was a kid, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8232.68s)]
*  Bruce Lee was the fucking man. I remember I saw a Bruce Lee movie and I was a little kid, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8236.04s)]
*  I was over at my friend's house and it was on television. I couldn't believe it. Like, look at [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8240.44s)]
*  this guy. Yeah. Like I wanted to get noon chucks. I want to do it. But the reality of like a bunch [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8245.480000000001s)]
*  of people rushing you like, now this one comes at you. Now that guy goes, no. In the real world, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8250.68s)]
*  people just fucking pile on top of you and no one can really, if they're a smaller person, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8255.560000000001s)]
*  you're probably in a lot of trouble if someone's bigger and stronger than you in like a wild [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8264.12s)]
*  fist to cuffs situation. But in jujitsu, the smaller person really can defeat the larger [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8270.2s)]
*  unskilled person all the time. Every time. Every time. Every time. That's not the case. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8277.800000000001s)]
*  We said it before. If it's a freak athlete, you get a big professional football player, right? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8284.12s)]
*  Right. I mean, you got to be, this guy, this little guy better be real good, right? Real good. But [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8288.12s)]
*  like, you know, like every time, you know, I was reading some book and it was just like, they were [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8294.84s)]
*  just talking about like, if you get to your blue belt, you can literally with your hands murder [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8299.8s)]
*  like 90% of the people you encounter in life. Yeah, it makes sense. Like somewhere around there. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8307.56s)]
*  Yeah. Like just, and that's like, you know, not that you want to murder people, but I'm saying [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8312.039999999999s)]
*  like, you've like defend to the death, dude. And when you talk about martial arts, like, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8315.32s)]
*  like jujitsu is like, you can choke somebody to death. You can break their fucking limbs. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8318.759999999998s)]
*  Like it is pretty hardcore when you really to its fullest, like when it's not respectful and [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8322.759999999998s)]
*  you're tapping and if it's used for what it was initially used for, I mean, it's a really brutal [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8327.0s)]
*  martial art. And here's what's important. You use it exactly the same way in training as you do on [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8332.68s)]
*  the street. So the problem with striking martial arts were if you were sparring, particularly [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8339.16s)]
*  you're sparring with your friends, you always pulled back. Like you never tried to knock your [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8344.52s)]
*  friends out. You always like at least something pulled back in jujitsu. You go full blast. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8349.4s)]
*  So you're going full blast together and you're constantly used to someone going full blast. So [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8355.24s)]
*  if you're on the street and all of a sudden there's some fucking altercation and you're [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8360.76s)]
*  clenching with a guy, it's automatic. Instinctual. That's it. And you're going to get usually a guy [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8364.52s)]
*  that is either your level or better than you, which is like, it's just the way it's like designed. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8369.880000000001s)]
*  Like you're just really designed iron sharpens iron and you're going with guys. It's built to, [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8375.800000000001s)]
*  it's like comedy. It really is because you can't fake it. You can't fake it. You have to have the [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8380.68s)]
*  stage time. You have to have the reps. You have to have the mat time. And that's the big parallel [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8385.32s)]
*  between those two. And I think that's why a lot of comedians do jujitsu and they can get into that [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8388.76s)]
*  mentality. Is that right there? It's also great to kill, it kills anxiety. Kills anxiety. If you get [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8392.12s)]
*  good at jujitsu, like first of all, your physical worry about taking care of yourself diminishes [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8398.6s)]
*  somewhat. Cause you're like, oh, I'm like more confident with people than I ever thought I was [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8403.4s)]
*  before. Cause I'm not really worried about people beat me up. Right. And then on top of that, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8408.36s)]
*  you're training a lot so that you're always like, just fucking squeezing those demons out. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8412.44s)]
*  For a lot of people, that's like, that's what's holding them. But their body is like this [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8419.960000000001s)]
*  overflowing battery of anxiety and energy that's not being met and fucking needs that aren't being [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8423.880000000001s)]
*  fed and shitty food. And they're just like, and if you could get those fucking people to get out of [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8430.76s)]
*  that and start training something healthy, you know, and in jujitsu, the beautiful thing about it [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8436.44s)]
*  is it's fun to do. So you look forward to doing it. You look forward to working out. It's all [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8440.76s)]
*  interconnected and working out is very similar to it. I think jujitsu is easier to get for me to get [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8444.04s)]
*  motivated with. But it really is you spend your time, you know, thinking, we're talking so much [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8448.12s)]
*  about like being on our phones, right? It's like when you're working out, you have to ignore your [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8453.480000000001s)]
*  phone. There's no fucking looking at your cell phone when you're training, right? And you have [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8457.960000000001s)]
*  just a little bit of time each day where you're thinking about yourself, whether it's even just [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8462.44s)]
*  being in the moment and doing jujitsu and trying to get better, but you're just genuinely trying [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8466.6s)]
*  to better yourself. All bullshit aside, you're there to better yourself physically, mentally. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8470.28s)]
*  That is a really healthy thing that people should be doing, you know, in some capacity every day, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8475.800000000001s)]
*  they should be putting the bullshit away and just either it's almost like meditative. Like your mind [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8481.880000000001s)]
*  sometimes goes blank and you're like, I'm like, oh, I'm finally not thinking about like my stresses [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8486.92s)]
*  for like one minute. I would imagine like dirt bag riding is like that. Yeah. Get on a fucking [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8491.16s)]
*  bike and run. Yeah, running just got much for my knees, man. I've just had too many knee injuries. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8495.64s)]
*  So I'm running now and I have the meniscus tears, but my doctor, my doctor was like, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8501.56s)]
*  no, really not. I wear knee braces. The running is fine. I don't run. I fucking jog. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8506.2s)]
*  You land on the balls of your feet? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I run. That takes a little adjusting [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8511.88s)]
*  to, right? When you, when you had like running shoes back in the day, I always ran on the heels. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8516.92s)]
*  I thought that's what they were for. I thought that's why I was that they changed the, the human [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8521.24s)]
*  gate. When I started running, I just, it was when I started working out, I started running every day. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8525.64s)]
*  Initially, the first time I started working, I just started doing pushups every day and then running, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8530.52s)]
*  right? And I was like, I can do this. Let me start working out. And then I, you know, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8534.76s)]
*  sort of cutting carbs and then I lost weight very quickly. It was the first time my body was ever [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8538.04s)]
*  like adjusting to working out and going on a diet. So it was extreme. Like I lost a lot of weight [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8541.4s)]
*  very, very quickly. I got very motivated. He got a job in a gym. I was selling, you know, high end [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8547.0s)]
*  gym memberships for a few years. Um, and, uh, but when I started running, I was wearing like, I want [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8551.16s)]
*  to say like air walks or some like shitty skateboarding shoe. And I, by first few months, [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8558.279999999999s)]
*  I just rent and my feet were just in extreme pain. Like that, like, oh my God, dude, it was, [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8563.64s)]
*  it was wild how bad my feet are. And I was just like, oh yeah, dude, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8568.12s)]
*  Oh, you're getting plantar fasciitis. I think that's what was going on. Yeah. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8570.76s)]
*  And then I just got running shoes and I was like, oh, okay, no, that's, that's not it at all. So, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8574.44s)]
*  and then I started looking up running form. I went to like one of those stores where they, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8578.36s)]
*  they told you how to run. And so I think I have pretty decent, you know, running form. I run like [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8581.240000000002s)]
*  three miles a day. Do you run on the street or do you run on a trail? I run on the street. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8586.44s)]
*  I run on the street in Jersey. I ran in Austin twice. That seems like a lot of like impact on [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8590.36s)]
*  your knees. And I'm heavy too. I'm like two, two or five now. Yeah. Hmm. I know it's probably not [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8596.28s)]
*  the best for my knees, but it's literally the only thing that really helps me like cut fat. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8602.2s)]
*  That's why those like, um, thick ass running cushy shoes make sense. People that run on streets, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8606.6s)]
*  that makes sense there. You wouldn't want to be barefoot running on the street. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8613.08s)]
*  I just like running outside, dude. You'd sort of get into, I can run on a treadmill. It's just [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8616.12s)]
*  a little bit more, I'm watching the clock, which I'm just staring at that clock, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8619.24s)]
*  which I think is not good. I like to turn on some music, just sort of get in my head, [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8623.16s)]
*  think about what's ever going on in my life and just try to work out some shit and just fucking go. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8627.16s)]
*  I do most of my cardio lately. I've been doing on this, uh, you know what an echo bike is? Like an [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8632.52s)]
*  aerosol bike. Um, it's one of those things you go, Oh yeah. Yeah. So they create too much wind. I get [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8638.52s)]
*  cold because I sweat a lot. So I'm like, fuck it. I feel like just this draft on me the whole time [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8646.119999999999s)]
*  that I hate rogue actually, uh, invented a thing that fits over the fan. Oh really? Yeah. It doesn't [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8650.36s)]
*  blow blow out. So annoying blows forward. Yeah. Yeah. So it's good, but I just watch fights, [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8656.44s)]
*  watch fights and do Tabata sprints. So it's a 22nd sprint, 10 second rest, 22nd sprint, 10 second. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8661.32s)]
*  Right. That's the shit. That thing's the shit. That thing's hell. Yeah. That's hard to use. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8666.76s)]
*  You just like one of those. What does that thing like the fucking, um, yeah, it's like a, it's [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8670.84s)]
*  like a rowing machine, but it's standing up. Yeah. Standing up. You just pull it down. Oh, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8674.84s)]
*  that thing sucks. I never touch. I have one of those. I never use it. No. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8678.28s)]
*  What are the, uh, the, what are the Jacob's ladder thing where it's like a ladder that [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8683.16s)]
*  you climb up that thing's hard as hell to use. Those are really good. Those are really good. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8685.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Cause it works your core the whole time. You're doing bear crawls uphill. Yeah. Fuck that. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8688.12s)]
*  Use it to lose it, bro. Use it to lose it. I know. I wish I had that motivation. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8692.6s)]
*  Well, for me, it's a mental health thing as much as it is anything. I don't feel good. I know me. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8697.800000000001s)]
*  I don't feel good if I don't work out. Do you need to go deep when you work out? Like, do you need [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8704.36s)]
*  to go like, cause I see you post videos or, you know, pictures of you like just covered in fucking [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8708.52s)]
*  sweat. I sweat like that if I just walk around a little bit, but like, do you need to go that [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8713.320000000002s)]
*  like hard in order to sort of get the mental side out of it to bring yourself to a certain place? [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8718.36s)]
*  Cause I like a nice easy workout. Yeah. I don't do many of those, those nice easy ones. I do long [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8722.28s)]
*  ones because when I do kettlebells, generally I subscribe to the idea that more reps over a [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8728.84s)]
*  longer period of time is better than less reps over a shorter period of time. If you're just [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8737.64s)]
*  trying to get strength and not muscle endurance. So I follow this guy, Paavo Tatsalin, who's like [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8742.44s)]
*  the godfather of kettlebells in America. He brought kettlebells or start teaching people [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8748.76s)]
*  kettlebells in America. And what he says is like, you don't, you, you don't go to failure. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8753.32s)]
*  Like say if you have a weight that you can clean and press and you can do it 10 times, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8758.76s)]
*  don't do it 10 times, do it five and put it down, put it down for five minutes, then do it five [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8764.92s)]
*  again. Now you have five clean reps. They're perfect clean. So you did 10 reps, but you did [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8769.48s)]
*  them all like you're learning something. And he said strength is a skill and you don't want to do [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8776.039999999999s)]
*  a skill when you're tired. And when you're learning how to control large heavy weights, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8781.96s)]
*  you shouldn't get it to the point where your muscles are failing. And so he's like his [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8787.8s)]
*  philosophy, and this is a Russian sport philosophy. They, they, and they had some fucking geniuses [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8792.599999999999s)]
*  over there training their athletes. They, they figured out that if you just get the same reps, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8798.279999999999s)]
*  like say instead of doing two sets of 10, you're better off doing four sets of five because every [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8804.279999999999s)]
*  rep will be perfect. And just the form, the full range of motion probably is a big, a big part of [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8810.28s)]
*  it. You're not going to get a sore and your body is not going to get this lactic acid buildup on [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8815.08s)]
*  this in this, you're not going to break form, you know, like when you're really, you're fucking, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8820.68s)]
*  your muscles are broken down, like you're breaking form, like you're cheating a little, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8826.84s)]
*  you're doing curls, you're leaning back, you know, his idea is do the same amount of reps, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8830.68s)]
*  but have longer breaks in between the sets and do it over a longer period of time. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8836.44s)]
*  And every rep is perfect. Yeah. I, yeah, that's probably right. I mean, I, when I, typically when [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8841.640000000001s)]
*  I work out, I try to superset everything I try, cause I try to, I try to get cardio in at the same [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8846.92s)]
*  time. Right. So I'll go in, I'll warm up, do a little bit of cardio, but then I'm just trying to [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8851.32s)]
*  bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, fucking drop sets, go to failure, go to failure again, just sweating. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8856.36s)]
*  Like, but that's just like the way that I learned. That's like an old school way. And also I kind of [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8861.08s)]
*  like lifting old school. Like when I'm lifting weights, I like going to the gym and doing just [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8866.2s)]
*  the normal shit, right? It's a bench press, curls, squats, just the, just the basics and just throwing [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8872.12s)]
*  a decent amount of weight on. Like I can't, I'm not that strong. I lived through a birdcrisher. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8880.12s)]
*  Bird is fucking strong. He's a house. Holy shit, dude. We, we lifted at some, you know, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8883.560000000001s)]
*  college football fucking thing that he brought me to with a bunch of famous people and football [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8889.800000000001s)]
*  players. I have no idea who was there, what I was doing there. And Burke Chrysler is a fucking [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8894.44s)]
*  tank dude. Yeah. I'm trying to remember how much he lifted. He, it was, it was, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8899.0s)]
*  what exercise you guys doing? We were benching. Yeah. He was doing, he did, I think, uh, [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8903.0s)]
*  two plates on each side, but he did like, I want to say 15 reps, like it was nothing. It was fucking [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8907.640000000001s)]
*  crazy. We had a sober October here once and we all got hammered. We went out to lift weights [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8911.880000000001s)]
*  and none of them could even do two 25. No, really? So the fact that he goes from two 25 then to be [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8916.52s)]
*  able to do it 15. Oh yeah. At least 10. 10 times with ease. That's impressive. Yeah. I was like, [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8921.72s)]
*  he was fucking, he was hitting baseballs and just fucking cracking them. Yeah. If he wasn't an [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8928.679999999998s)]
*  alcoholic, he would be a fucking serious athlete. It's probably what's kept him so healthy this whole [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8933.4s)]
*  time while he's boozing it up, boozing up a storm. Two 25, 10 times. Yeah, dude. Here it is. It was [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8938.679999999998s)]
*  wild. Yeah, this is it. One. That's crazy. Cause he couldn't do it at all before. Three, four, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8945.8s)]
*  five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. He could have done two more with a spot. He could have got 11. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8952.119999999999s)]
*  I think he could have done 11. Yeah. Look at that. Beautiful. Yeah. He's awesome, dude. He's also [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8965.96s)]

*  know he's on a diet right now. Allegedly. For another week. Who knows? I'm hoping for him, [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8978.52s)]
*  though. He called me and said it was two months. That's awesome. And he said he's loving it. And [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=8983.640000000001s)]

*  some questionable liquid in there. Yeah. He's the man. So anyway, should we end it? That's good. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AgFjjiWTj0&t=9024.36s)]
