# Joe Rogan Experience #1410 - Ash Dykes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGLgfGT032s)
*  Do you think a salt lamp's real? Do you think that thing does anything?
*  I don't know how much you'd need, hey. Well, it keeps, it's got a hat on it.
*  Yeah. So it's not being taken too seriously. And that's actually a big one, you get a lot smaller than that, don't you?
*  Yeah, I saw that one, that was the biggest one you could find on Amazon, so I got that.
*  Yeah. Cause I'm a glutton. I like big things, big salt rocks.
*  Why the hell not? Yeah, why not? I'm like, I want a big one. Do it.
*  It's very, very flashy. Do you think that does anything though?
*  I don't know, good question. It's, it just lets the air off and just breathing in the natural salts on you. Helps with the sleep as well.
*  But how is it doing that? It's just by being in the room? Yeah.
*  Hmm. Maybe I should have them everywhere. Well, isn't it the light underneath as well?
*  So the light, the heat from the light? The heat sets off the air, I believe so.
*  Sounds like horseshit, right? I studied it. Could be, could be a little bit.
*  Yeah, it looks good though, right?
*  So you asked me before if, if you were the first Welshman. Yes.
*  I think you are. Is that the case? Really, Jamie? Do you know if that's the case?
*  Somebody might have snuck in and didn't tell us. There we go. Yeah.
*  What is this thing that you brought? So I thought if I'm the first Welsh person, I've got to bring.
*  Try to keep this like our fifth. Sure. There we go.
*  I got to bring a Welsh dragon for you. A Welsh dragon? A Welsh dragon.
*  So this is on our flag in Wales. Goes back a long time ago since we were like protecting ourselves.
*  Pride. Wow, it's cool. Don't really know the history, but there we go.
*  So this is a classic Welsh dragon. Welsh dragon, yeah.
*  I think his name like one of the coolest flags in the world.
*  He's just got this big, big raging dragon on our flag. That is pretty cool.
*  So I thought if I'm the first Welsh person, I've got to bring you a, the red dragon.
*  Look at it right there. There's some, some images of it. There we go.
*  Yeah. Have you been to Wales before? No. No? No. How badass is it?
*  Should I go? Yeah, beautiful. It is a good place.
*  Lots of mountains right on the coast there as well, of course.
*  Forests, lakes, good for training. It's where I do all my training. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Hardcore elements. Speaking of training, Ash, tell everybody what you've done.
*  So I've recently, only five months ago now, five and a half months, came back from achieving my third
*  world first record in walking the entire length of the Yangtze River in China.
*  So it's the third longest river in the world, the longest to run through a single nation.
*  So it's 4,000 miles. It took 352 days.
*  And it's from the Tibetan Plateau in the west of China.
*  So you're talking 5,100 meters above sea level, which is equivalent to Everest Base Camp.
*  And yeah, 4,000 miles later, 352 days, you end up near the, near Shanghai, where it pours out into the East China Sea.
*  You know, when I thought, when I heard that you did this, I thought two things.
*  One, I thought this guy's insane. Like, what kind of willpower does it take to walk and hike 4,000 plus miles?
*  But the other thing I thought is this kind of validates a lot of the ideas that people have always had about human
*  beings migrating from Africa and through Siberia and through the Bering Strait.
*  Like, if you can do that, what you did, what you did is not dissimilar.
*  You know, that's it. Yeah.
*  You've got trails all over the world.
*  And you're just doing it for a world record.
*  Imagine if you're doing it because you're trying to stay alive.
*  Exactly.
*  You're trying to keep your family alive.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll tell you what.
*  Yeah, we would have had, oh, there's so much, so much history in journeys that man kind of, kind of taken on since.
*  Wow.
*  I'm reading Sapien at the minute.
*  Oh, it's great.
*  I only just started.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's just mind boggling with the numbers, you know, it takes right back and it's like, whoa, whoa.
*  But yeah, so the source of the Yangtze, it was actually only discovered in 2009, the true and scientific source.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, that gives us, we had to do two, it took over two years of planning.
*  So it was a case of working heavily in China, finding out whether this had ever been done before it took, we had to get different teams involved globally.
*  And then we discovered that I was always, I was always preparing to go from the traditional source, which is most famous for the source of the Yangtze River being there.
*  But then we only discovered about a year into the planning that actually there's a true and scientific source found by the same guy who mapped the traditional source.
*  Yet he partnered up with NASA, used all the satellite technology, was able to correct his wrong, slightly longer than the traditional source.
*  And that was it, we were like, right, it's got to be the true and scientific source.
*  How much longer is it?
*  It's probably only a distance of 20 to 30 miles, which that's only really a day's trek.
*  But it was more close to Tibet, it was more south, southwest of China.
*  So it was closer to the Tibetan border, which means it's a little bit more sensitive.
*  So it was tougher to go from from the true and scientific source for sure.
*  But it's the longer one.
*  If you're going to walk that distance, you've got to do it the proper way.
*  Yeah, I agree with you.
*  I'm glad you think that way.
*  But obviously a person that's willing to walk 4,000 miles would think that way.
*  You wouldn't skip on 20 miles.
*  Imagine if you skipped on 20 miles and everyone's like, well, you did a pretty good job.
*  But actually Mike over here just did the whole thing.
*  Exactly.
*  The actual scientific one.
*  He's the real one.
*  Well, that happened towards the end as well.
*  So coming up near Shanghai, there's an official point of where the Yangtze pours into the East China Sea.
*  And they're like, you know, you only have to go to this point.
*  I'm like, no, I walk into where the land ends.
*  So that took me an extra, only an extra couple of days.
*  But can you imagine finishing?
*  It's like, oh, you didn't quite make it, did you?
*  You were close.
*  But you didn't quite make it.
*  What is the feeling like when you know you only have two days left?
*  Oh man.
*  Well, we were hit by storm, storm Rikima.
*  So it was one of the biggest storms they've had in the past 30 years.
*  And that put me into hiding.
*  You know, I had to shelter up after everything that I faced over 350 days, you know.
*  And that stopped me only a couple of days before I crossed into the East China Sea
*  before the finish.
*  But at that point, it's almost I had visualized the completion over and over again in my head.
*  I played it so many times of what it would be like, what it would feel like.
*  It's, you know, everything to to cross the finish line that almost when that day happened
*  and I did cross the finish line, I almost over visualized.
*  I didn't feel anything.
*  It's just like, well, it's about damn time, you know.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And I believe, you know, the law of attraction visualization.
*  I've always been a big believer in that.
*  And same with Mongolia and Madagascar, which were my previous expeditions.
*  I almost lost my life on both of those trips.
*  By the time that I'm suffering, I'm just constantly visualizing.
*  You know, I was focusing on recovering, getting better, visualizing the finish.
*  Keep getting up, keep pushing on.
*  I want to get to that.
*  I want to get to those.
*  But I want to I want to ask you, when you decide to plan this trip.
*  Yeah.
*  So how much had you learned from the first two crazy trips that you had?
*  And how did you calculate, like, how much food you're going to need?
*  Where are you going to meet neat pit stops?
*  Were you going to be able to like, how did you do it?
*  So with that, we're always looking for communities along a long route.
*  You know, if there's a community, there's food.
*  And so and actually that brings me back to the traditional and then the true scientific source.
*  If we went from the traditional, we'd go maybe one week or one and a half weeks
*  without coming across any locals.
*  So we'd have to carry a week and a half worth of Russian packs in our backpack.
*  But that's true in scientific source centers back.
*  I think it was two or three weeks.
*  We couldn't find any community along the way via satellite
*  and via the people that we were there.
*  My logistics managers.
*  So that means we need to carry craziest way to try to visit people.
*  Yeah.
*  Find them through satellite as you're trekking through a forest.
*  Yeah.
*  And then try to get food.
*  That's it.
*  And we're always maximizing it as well.
*  So we're saying, OK, that's three weeks.
*  So let's carry food for three and a half or four weeks
*  because that community is now empty or abandoned.
*  Then we're out of food.
*  What what are you carrying for food?
*  I would carry ration packs.
*  So and the ration packs were pretty good.
*  We had like chicken tikka masala spaghetti bolognese carbonara
*  and each ration pack was around 800 kilocalories.
*  And are you using are these dehydrated?
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  So you just boil the water.
*  You pour it in there.
*  You wait about 15 minutes like a mountain house like that kind of a deal.
*  Yeah, yeah, similar.
*  That's it.
*  So you must be so looking forward to regular food by the time that's over.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, what's the first thing you ate?
*  You know, the one that I was protein, the one I was craving was just protein.
*  So I was thinking of peanut butter.
*  I was thinking of cheese on toast because you had just mostly carbohydrates.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So I was like chicken as well as a big thing.
*  I was just craving all of this big time.
*  That's I don't know what the first thing I.
*  It's funny how your body knows what you need.
*  Exactly. Yeah, you've got to listen to your body.
*  Yeah, you got to listen.
*  It's hard to listen.
*  I mean, it's hard to know.
*  Well, I don't not really sure what I hear.
*  Yeah, you know, you had an odd craving.
*  Sometimes I'm craving ice cream.
*  Is that supposed?
*  I'm supposed to listen.
*  Just have ice cream.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Seems weird.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  Just listen to your cravings.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think, yeah, no, you are.
*  It is.
*  I think almost listening to it.
*  You've got to be stripped of all the all of the protein and what not running for you
*  your body currently having you.
*  I think if you fool, you're craving ice cream.
*  You know, if you feel you want a dessert, but I think if you're now at the point of
*  not starvation, but if you're really hungry and you know, what's good?
*  What's not good?
*  You I think your body gives a good tail sign of what you can at the last month of
*  Mission Yanksy.
*  I was really bad.
*  I was coming across cities every day because you can imagine like towards Shanghai.
*  You coming across cities coming across towns communities.
*  And so I was just craving protein.
*  I was craving fats.
*  And a lot of the time for that last month, I was just eating really unhealthily.
*  Just getting in stodgy foods, dodgy fats, protein.
*  You know, there was fast food chains along the way KFC, you know, that's sort of
*  real.
*  Yes, I was out of the wild.
*  The wilderness was like six months worth.
*  Once I'd finished the first half, it was gradual for then another two or three
*  months, but the last three months you're going through city after city all really
*  built up high population there.
*  And I found that my body was crazy.
*  So I was listening to my body scraping fat, scraping protein.
*  And yeah, you're right.
*  It did get ridiculous.
*  I was going to these, you know, fast food and I the translation I could speak
*  Chinese a little bit.
*  I was just going to ask you to get by.
*  But some say Chinese like which dialect.
*  Oh, there's over a hundred dialects.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's where it got difficult.
*  Oh no.
*  So even yeah, it was nails.
*  It was nails really difficult.
*  So what mandarin would you speak your basic mandarin?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Enough to just about get by but I skipped all of the basics and went straight into
*  the sentences where all where are there bears here?
*  Are there bears?
*  Where are the wolves?
*  Where are the wolves?
*  Water, food and shelter.
*  So yeah, skipped a lot of the basics went straight into those are two questions.
*  I don't ever want to hear.
*  Are there bears here and where are the wolves?
*  Yeah, not are there wolves here?
*  Where are they?
*  Where are they?
*  Fuck that's it.
*  And you're out there walking.
*  Yeah.
*  For a year.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  I'm for the first six months, especially.
*  So the first six months is mostly hiking in the woods.
*  It's hiking in the wilderness on the Tibetan Plateau.
*  Are you carrying your camp on your back?
*  Yeah.
*  So you have a baby sack.
*  Like what do you sleep in?
*  A tent.
*  So we have a really lightweight sort of Kailas tent.
*  Get it up storm proof.
*  It's amazing how light they can get those things to know.
*  Great.
*  It was incredible.
*  Yeah, because I had to carry all of the foot we were filming for a documentary.
*  So I had to carry electronics and got too heavy.
*  Now do you when you're in this tent, do you go with a double layer tent?
*  So you have provides more insulation.
*  It's a little heavier or do you have like a really lightweight tent and just
*  try to tough it out in the cold?
*  We have, I had a double layer, but that's because the double layer was just
*  so small and so light.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was a case of yeah, you know, that's your comfort.
*  That's your shelter.
*  Right, right.
*  And I'm going to be facing some big storms.
*  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
*  I was like you'd sacrifice probably the weight for just something that's going
*  to keep you insulated in there.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have a pad that protects you from the ground?
*  Yeah.
*  So I had a little mattress pad on top of that.
*  Yeah, we've got the pad like the waterproof pad on the ground from the
*  tent and then we've got a sleeping mat, maybe about this, this thick about
*  a half an inch to an inch thickness.
*  And then I had a minus 25 or minus 30 degree Celsius sleeping bag.
*  And what that is in Fahrenheit.
*  But that was a, you know, you got toasty inside.
*  It could be minus 20.
*  What is the issue with the ground though?
*  Like do you have to have an insulated pad to make sure that the ground
*  cold doesn't get to you?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  That's what the sleeping mat is.
*  So it's sort of, you can roll it down.
*  It's really small, really tight, really lightweight as well.
*  But once you roll it out, it's got like memory foam almost inside something
*  similar and you have to blow in it, pump it up a little bit more.
*  Oh, I see.
*  Only takes 10, 20 breaths.
*  Easy to pack away as well.
*  Really protects you from the cold, the ground, it protects from there.
*  Cause that's what you need.
*  You know, the ground just, dude, I've never been comfortable camping.
*  It's always just like, it's always like you wake up like popping.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  You're awake.
*  You made it, but still you feel weird.
*  Yeah, you can do, you do get used to it.
*  Yeah.
*  But, um, especially after the trekking, we were covering 50 kilometers
*  some days, we were covering about 20, 25 miles, especially in the Tibetan plateau.
*  So after that day's trek, only two ration packs per day.
*  So you're taking in 1600 calories.
*  That's not a lot.
*  It's not a lot.
*  And we were carrying.
*  How much weight did you lose?
*  I probably, and I've still lost weight now, about 13, 12 to 13 kilograms.
*  I would say in weight, which over the year was I lost the same amount in Mongolia.
*  32 pounds something.
*  It's about 32, is it?
*  32 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  So, um, wow, that's a lot of weight to lose.
*  You're not a big guy.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Fuck man.
*  That must've been, you must've been really drawn out at the end.
*  Big time.
*  Although it kind of worked itself out because towards the end I was coming
*  across more food, didn't need my, my ration packs, of course.
*  So I was coming across more, um, restaurants.
*  I can collect food as I, as I go.
*  It's not solo and unsupported journey.
*  Um, so I was just utilizing that.
*  I was eating with the locals and I was, you know, taking as much calories down as I
*  possibly could whilst I was trekking.
*  Did you pick like the type of meals based on calories?
*  Did you like when I'm talking about like the mountain house type deals or I don't
*  know what company you used.
*  What kind of,
*  Oh, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Expedition foods.
*  I think.
*  So they have different ones that are more nutrient rich and more calorie rich.
*  Yeah.
*  They have the smaller light ones as well, which you get about 600 calories.
*  Um, they are smaller.
*  They are lighter, easier to pack, but I needed as much as I could possibly get.
*  You know, they have a bunch of healthy options now because a lot of crossfitters
*  are out there camping these days.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  They want to get that healthy paleo food while they're out there in the mountain.
*  But the, what's undeniable has, has got to be for you is that once you've made
*  those steps, the first steps for the first day, you have this monumental thing
*  in front of you.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what, what was that like knowing when you started like here ready?
*  All right.
*  Bye Ash.
*  Bye.
*  It was, see you in here.
*  Oh man.
*  Yeah.
*  It was exactly that.
*  It was exactly that.
*  It was daunting.
*  It was so before we got to the, before we got to the source of the Yangtze River,
*  we lost, I think four members.
*  When I say lost, they survived, but they got altitude sickness.
*  Um, they were fearing for their lives because of the bears, because of the walls.
*  So before we reached day number one, before we reached the start line,
*  we've already got four members of the film crew of guides, uh, evacuated,
*  taken off the mountains, which brought me off the mountains as well.
*  Cause I needed to regroup with a different team.
*  So everyone was scared and people also got altitude sickness.
*  That's it.
*  How high are you up there?
*  We are just over 5,000 meters.
*  Oh my God.
*  At this point.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's equivalent to Everest Base Camp, I'd say.
*  Oh my God.
*  Which you can get altitude sickness from.
*  One of the guides about it.
*  That's really fucking high.
*  That's 15,000 feet, right?
*  That is about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's uh.
*  And there's wolves up there?
*  There's wolves.
*  Yeah.
*  There's bears.
*  You can't even run.
*  You got no air.
*  Yeah.
*  What, how help us would you feel at 15,000 feet when you see a pack of wolves?
*  Like, oh man.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're looking at you like, Hey, you don't look too good, buddy.
*  It's the bears that scared me the most.
*  Oh, they should scare you.
*  You can't do anything against a bear.
*  Can you?
*  You can't do anything against a wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do anything against a wolf.
*  Especially 15,000 feet.
*  Exactly.
*  When you can barely tie your shoes.
*  Pack of them as well.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And we can't carry any weaponry.
*  So leave it there.
*  So literally.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, sitting duck.
*  Really?
*  You can't carry any weaponry?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't even have a knife?
*  I tried.
*  I took a knife out.
*  Did I say?
*  Yeah.
*  I took a knife out, but I was, it was taken from me in security, flying out to the West.
*  So I bought another one in Yushu.
*  Yeah.
*  I did have a knife for the first month or two.
*  Yeah.
*  But again, a pack of wolves.
*  Yeah.
*  You ain't going to do shit with a little baby ass knife.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  You're going to rip your ankles apart.
*  That's it.
*  They tear your legs apart.
*  Yeah.
*  Wolves are the nastiest hunters.
*  Big time.
*  And we had a close encounter as well with a pack.
*  There was a, yeah, there was a Tibetan.
*  He was trying to warn us.
*  He was trying to say, well, this is, this is my angle.
*  We were just talking to him.
*  He looked a little bit worried.
*  It looked a little bit stressed.
*  We're high on the mountains.
*  He keeps pointing down at a valley talking to his Tibetan.
*  We didn't understand.
*  We just sort of waved.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Bye.
*  Big smile.
*  Off we go.
*  Say, well, it was me and my friend, also videographer, Kyle.
*  We cracked on, but Kyle filmed all of that conversation.
*  And four months later, we find out that from a girl from my
*  editor team in Beijing, who could speak Tibetan, that he
*  was saying right ahead, right down that valley is a pack of
*  wolves.
*  And only yesterday they had killed a local lady and trying
*  to, you know, they were trying to get us not to go down there
*  saying don't go.
*  But we didn't know.
*  So we like, oh yeah, well the best.
*  Thanks.
*  See ya.
*  And we cracked on and for the next two days we were followed.
*  We believe we were followed by or stalked by a pack of wolves.
*  Oh my God.
*  And they cover bigger distance than then humans cover, you
*  know, for two days.
*  They were just out in the same proximity, same distance away.
*  Fuck it.
*  You have a sign of a fuck.
*  Fuck.
*  How do you go to sleep at night?
*  What's that like?
*  Yeah, it was luckily it was windy.
*  The wind would pick up at nighttime.
*  So it would rile your tent.
*  So you couldn't hear the howling.
*  Don't hear it during the day.
*  Yeah, you still stood there.
*  You're nice.
*  They told us that you constantly shout over to your
*  buddy.
*  Are you okay?
*  You just going to become a burrito in the middle of the
*  night?
*  Yeah.
*  Tent.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was scary.
*  I felt vulnerable, really vulnerable up there.
*  Fuck, bro.
*  And the local.
*  How many days were you doing this with the wolves?
*  So it was two days that they were following us, but we
*  were in sort of Wolf County, if you like, for the best part
*  of two or three months, I would say.
*  With the bears as well.
*  And the bears became an issue because I sort of went out
*  there with a healthy mindset.
*  As long as I leave the bears alone, the bears are going
*  to leave me alone, right?
*  But the locals were telling me otherwise they would start
*  showing me photos, start showing me videos and sending
*  me clips saying this happened only one, two kilometers away
*  from where you are now.
*  People were killed by bears.
*  People were killed just running into huts, killing
*  families.
*  And they were trying to say that they're coming off the
*  mountains because it's too cold.
*  They're looking for calories before they go into hibernation.
*  So we were there in the wrong season.
*  And it's that terrified us the most.
*  It was the stories of the locals.
*  And you know, if the locals panic, then you should
*  definitely be panicking as well.
*  There's a lot of parts of the world where you have to be
*  really worried about wild animals all the time.
*  Yeah, we here in America, for whatever reason, we've
*  forgotten that.
*  I think everybody that lives in a big city is basically
*  kind of forgotten that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you make that trek, you realize like, oh, there's
*  no rules out here.
*  They're they'll eat you.
*  That's it.
*  They'll eat everything.
*  They'll eat a caribou.
*  They'll eat a moose.
*  Why wouldn't they eat you?
*  Yeah.
*  What do they think?
*  You're special.
*  They don't even know what the fuck you are.
*  That's it.
*  It's probably the only thing that keeps you alive is they
*  haven't eaten a person lately.
*  Yeah.
*  And they take like you said caribou.
*  They can take the best.
*  They gonna just time caribou like moose.
*  Yeah, moose are huge as well.
*  My friend watched a moose kill or excuse me, watched a
*  bear kill a moose on a spotting scope.
*  He was looking through a spotting scope and he saw a
*  bear swat down the back of a moose just break its back.
*  It's terrifying.
*  He said the grizzly hit the moose so hard.
*  It snapped its back.
*  Geez.
*  I'm like what?
*  The power, the shish, the strength in a bear and they
*  are big on the moose.
*  Moose are huge.
*  Yeah.
*  This bear swatted that thing and broke its back and he
*  said he watched it go down.
*  He watched this chase.
*  There's like this altercation between this bear and the
*  moose and he stayed on it and the bear gets a hold of
*  the moose and just fucking swats it.
*  The moose is like I gotta get the fuck out of here and
*  the bear's like bitch you're going nowhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Those animals are up there in China too.
*  Yeah.
*  They're very similar type of bear, right?
*  It's a type of brown bear.
*  Isn't it?
*  Type of brown bear.
*  Yeah.
*  Slightly.
*  You've got the big ones here.
*  Haven't you?
*  The grizzlies in Alaska.
*  Not here.
*  They killed them all in California.
*  Everything that they had.
*  Yeah.
*  That was here in California.
*  It's on our flag.
*  It's our state flag.
*  If you look at the California state flag, there's a giant
*  grizzly bear in the middle of the California state flag.
*  No way.
*  Because it used to be an issue here.
*  Got you.
*  They killed so many people that we just killed all the
*  bears.
*  Not we.
*  I wasn't here.
*  Got you.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah.
*  So further north now, are they?
*  That's it right there.
*  Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah.
*  They're nowhere near here.
*  You got to go up into like Vancouver.
*  British Columbia has them.
*  Towards the Rockies.
*  British Columbia has a lot of bears.
*  Yeah.
*  They have Montana has them.
*  Montana has grizzlies.
*  Wyoming has grizzlies.
*  Colorado may or may not.
*  My friend Adam saw them there.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're not in California anymore.
*  It's just because they killed them.
*  There's actually a town named after the last guy who died.
*  Oh really?
*  Leveque, California.
*  The last guy who got killed by a grizzly bear.
*  Just out hunting, was it?
*  Just probably being a dude that was alive back then.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Terrifying.
*  So you experienced this in China.
*  Yeah.
*  What are your precautions?
*  Are you allowed to bring bear spray?
*  So we had an air horn.
*  We had a whistle.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  A whistle.
*  A whistle.
*  Yeah.
*  So they say that the biggest attack happened from where
*  Tibetans out farming, doing their business in the mountains.
*  They're in the forest and they're surprised.
*  They come up the top of the hill.
*  There's a bear there.
*  And obviously the bears shocked, it's scared and it just attacks.
*  Yeah, that does happen with bears in America as well.
*  Yeah.
*  So they would say pretty much take a whistle, take an air horn,
*  make yourself aware.
*  Well, make the bear aware that you're present, you're approaching.
*  And normally they would scare off, they'd run away.
*  But there was a local that told me that, so they have these
*  big Tibetan masters.
*  Have you seen the Tibetan masters?
*  Yes.
*  The dogs that guard the two lives.
*  The plus pounds are huge.
*  Terrifying.
*  More of a problem than the wolves they were for me.
*  Because they can scare away the wolves, scare away snow leopards,
*  the bears.
*  But this one local was telling me that he wasn't living in his
*  go, which is like a white felt tent, like a yurt.
*  He was living in a concrete hut and he had a courtyard with a fence.
*  The fence was open, but just outside the fence is a Tibetan
*  mastiff chained up.
*  And he said that this bear wasn't fazed about the Tibetan mastiff.
*  It walked straight past it into the courtyard and was scratching
*  a steel door whilst he was hiding in one of his empty cupboards.
*  It lasted about 30, 40 minutes.
*  He was telling me this story.
*  I'm like, I'm in a tent.
*  I scratch it against a steel door and I'm just in a tent in the
*  wilderness.
*  Fuck man.
*  They're monsters.
*  If they weren't a real thing, if grizzly bears or brown bears
*  weren't real and then they were in a movie, you'd be like, what?
*  Imagine that poor guy.
*  And imagine you'd like, someone would ask someone like you, like
*  why in the world, if you know they're there, would you gonna
*  want to walk for that long?
*  Yeah.
*  Bear country.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's, that's it.
*  That's how many people are with you?
*  Um, towards the start.
*  So it was myself.
*  It was two guides that I had Tibetan guide so we can even
*  communicate, um, but with safety in numbers.
*  And we took a horse for the film crew, but the film crew got
*  altitude sickness and left us with the horse, which I named
*  Casta Choi.
*  Have you ever seen the movie face off?
*  Yes.
*  The badass Casta Choi.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  I've got this thing where I name like my bicycles or like carried
*  a chicken.
*  We'll get to that.
*  I carried a chicken in Madagascar.
*  I've been giving them old crazy ridiculous granny names.
*  And I was like, this horse is the last one standing.
*  That's my crew.
*  My, my guides are suffering with altitude sickness and being
*  taken off the mountains.
*  You've got this horse still suffering with altitude sickness.
*  Never knew that, but apparently horses can, animals can suffer
*  with altitude sickness, but he's there like a badass still going.
*  So it's just me and him.
*  And I'm like, I can't give you a granny's name like elder or
*  dot or Gertrude.
*  I'm giving you Casta Choi.
*  From face off.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  We've made fun of that movie multiple times with the preposterous
*  nature of switching faces.
*  You look exactly like Nicholas Cage now.
*  So the people come with you in the beginning and then they stay
*  with you the entire trip.
*  Yeah, we, we hope so.
*  No, sorry.
*  So it'd be so the first two guides that I had altitude sickness
*  as well as the film crew.
*  I came off the mountains.
*  I found two new guys who were willing to join me about 50% now
*  the UK team and the China team was saying, you know, abandon
*  the expedition start against start again next year.
*  But start again.
*  So yeah, try again next year because it was getting too
*  close to winter season.
*  How many days had you already walked?
*  We hadn't reached the start point yet.
*  Oh, so we had, we, I think it was four days.
*  It took for us to get to the start point, but just before
*  we reached the start point, that's when the film crew got
*  altitude sickness.
*  We sent them home.
*  And the next day my guide, he was vomiting.
*  He had nosebleed.
*  We had to get him off the mountains too.
*  So we left the horse with some local nomads, got him off
*  the mountains, regrouped with a different team and tried again.
*  So our first attempt towards the source was, it was a fail.
*  We regrouped it was myself, it was two guys.
*  It was the horse and we eventually finally made it to the
*  source.
*  It was just, it was on that, that gap in a nearby city of
*  regrouping with a new team with new guides that my team in
*  the UK and China were like saying, I think it's best if
*  you, if you hold back and we try again next year, cause
*  you'll be in the, in the Tibetan Plateau during the depths,
*  the depths of winter, which drops to about minus 30,
*  minus 40 degrees Celsius, which was a worry.
*  But I believe that we could get off the mountains.
*  It was the altitude that was the problem down into lower
*  altitude before the depths of winter.
*  For people who don't know the conversion.
*  I think that's where it meets in the middle at negative 40 is
*  where Celsius and Fahrenheit is the same.
*  Right.
*  So, okay.
*  So people in this country use Fahrenheit.
*  A lot of us you say Celsius.
*  We're like, yeah, I think minus 40 and minus 40 Fahrenheit
*  are the same.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Really?
*  I think that's where it hits the button.
*  Got you.
*  What does it say there?
*  Jamie minus minus Celsius minus 22 Fahrenheit.
*  You're right.
*  You go to minus 40.
*  I think minus 40 is right where it is.
*  No, no minus 40.
*  Yeah.
*  See.
*  Got you.
*  That's where it's exactly the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
*  There we are.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  Yeah.
*  How the fuck does that happen?
*  Yeah.
*  How is it the same thing?
*  Hmm.
*  Like you're never the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like how you become the same thing.
*  Like who's got the wonky system?
*  Is that minus one for minus 40?
*  It becomes the same.
*  There we go.
*  Very well minus 40 Fahrenheit.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Because it showed like 40 Celsius is very hot.
*  Right.
*  It's like a hundred plus degrees.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  40 plus 45.
*  You're melting.
*  That's a struggle.
*  But minus 40 is the same.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck is going on here?
*  Who's got the wacky?
*  What's 40 degrees Celsius in Fahrenheit then?
*  Four degrees Celsius is probably 100.
*  We will come to that.
*  104.
*  What is it 104?
*  104.
*  104.
*  Yeah.
*  104 Fahrenheit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's hot.
*  Yeah.
*  Weird.
*  Melting.
*  Melting.
*  Now what kind of gear are you guys taking with you in terms of like are you taking a jet boil?
*  Are you taking just matches?
*  You hoping to find wood?
*  Are you trying to stay light?
*  You have a lightweight stove.
*  Like what do you?
*  So we took a lightweight stove along with us.
*  We took flint with us as well.
*  Matches and a lighter.
*  No, no jet boil or anything like that because you wouldn't be able to refill them probably.
*  Yeah, what we had actually we had a bottle that connects to the stove and with that bottle you can either fill it up with gasoline,
*  but you can also use vodka, whiskey and you can run off the vapors.
*  You get pumping up pump the bottle the vapors leak out sparks a flame and you're good to go.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's what I talk especially in Mongolia.
*  You just get hammered everywhere.
*  You get your Russian vodka.
*  Oh, that's wild.
*  So you're drinking vodka just to like people think you're a drunk.
*  You really just trying to stay alive out there in the wilderness.
*  Yeah, you're not drinking it.
*  You're using it to fuel.
*  How much does it like is it efficient like you the use of vodka like how much vodka does it take to cook your meal?
*  Luckily, I didn't I didn't need to try it.
*  That was just a precaution that we told I always carried enough gasoline with me because by using the vodka or the whiskey
*  it does ruin the stove.
*  Oh, I see.
*  It like blocks the small hole that sparks the sparks the flame and you don't want that when you're in the middle of the wilderness.
*  Isn't that funny?
*  You would think that like if anything gasoline would be more fucked up.
*  Yeah, you would.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's probably because it's not all alcohol, right?
*  Yeah, a bunch of other shit in there.
*  It's got to be it's got to be but if you had rubbing alcohol pure rubbing alcohol probably burn even better.
*  Yeah, potentially.
*  Hey, you would thought so.
*  Yeah, the sole idea that you you had to do this.
*  How much encouragement did you get from people that you told the story to and how many people like you can't do this.
*  You're going to die up there.
*  I'd say a healthy mix for those who had seen the previous adventures that I had done.
*  They had a they had hope they held hope that faith in you.
*  Yeah, they had faith come on.
*  Surely he's got this.
*  They knew you'd already accomplished two amazing things.
*  That's it.
*  And it was never done recklessly.
*  First.
*  It was never really done for the record.
*  There was always environmental angle sustainability awareness, etc.
*  But it's also the planning.
*  So it's not not I used to do really reckless stuff.
*  We'll get to that.
*  But now it's meticulous planets the details looking at what can go wrong, but also learning how you can possibly overcome it.
*  So make it back home a good cliffhanger.
*  I'm glad we're going to get to that.
*  Yeah.
*  Let that sit for a second.
*  Yeah, but when you're walking what kind of equipment are using are using a GPS and if so, do you have solar panels that you're using to gather electricity?
*  Yeah, like what do you so yeah, we would take solar panels.
*  So we had solar panels.
*  We had the a couple of power banks.
*  So we'd use the solar panel to charge the power bank and then that will charge like the the GPS the the cameras.
*  Can I ask you how you do that?
*  Are you are you putting on the back of your backpack as you walk?
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, we strap it to the top of the rucksack.
*  Okay.
*  And you know, it's Mongolia especially is known as the eternal land of blue sky and where I was wasn't too far.
*  So we did have a lot of blue sky decent sun rays as able to charge the power bank and that power bank could last up to about a week and a half of charging depending on how I use it.
*  Really?
*  So it's really really useful.
*  That's incredible.
*  So when you're walking like how much does it take to what is the milliamp hour in the so what is it?
*  I think I think I studied it by how many charges I can get from the iPhone.
*  So I think it was seven or eight or eight charges from 0% on the iPhone to 100% 7 to 8 straight charges.
*  Okay, and that sometimes requires quite a bit.
*  Sometimes I was just charging the GoPro or the little satellite satellite phone and you're able to get that full charge just from that solar panel and how long just from the power bank.
*  Yeah, the solar panel would take a good while to charge up the the power bank.
*  So what I did is a good while a couple days.
*  I'd say a couple of a couple of days to get to 100%.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  25 to 30% per day.
*  I think it was interesting.
*  So it seems like you could almost get everything you need just in while you're walking every day.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, like you're right there.
*  If the days are good, you know, if we've access to blue sky, but I took does it work at all when it's cloudy?
*  It does but painfully slow paint like maybe after an hour you've bumped up a percent.
*  How crazy is the idea though of the they're stealing energy out of the sky?
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah, the sun the energy of the sun is powering your phone.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  I want to do it that way just to do it that way.
*  It just sounds so bad.
*  Yeah, that's the exactly exactly.
*  That's the way the world's moving as well.
*  Isn't it?
*  Yeah, the energy of the sun powering your phone.
*  I mean just the world just needs more efficient ways to use solar and they're going to get better at it for sure.
*  Yeah, it's far better than it used to be.
*  Yeah, I was shocked to see it all over China as well.
*  Actually, so you would imagine right?
*  There's a lot of rural places in particular that don't really have too much access to the grid.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you are you're traveling around you've got a using the phone as your GPS or do you have a standalone GPS unit?
*  So with China I was using like the GPS and that would keep me like a garment or something.
*  Yeah, I got an in reach.
*  They don't want me.
*  It was yeah, that's the one you can communicate with people right with that one.
*  You can send text only right?
*  Yeah, but I did I took a Navarino satellite phone cell phone and that would allow for calls and that got me out of a lot of a lot of difficult situations.
*  Were you were you ever in a situation where like I think these people are going to rob us?
*  I was robbed in Mongolia, but in China, no.
*  You got robbed in Mongolia? What happened?
*  They stole my solar panel.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, they did it so politely so nicely.
*  They just came over they visited I was chilling with them eating my ration pack.
*  They brought some food and some tea over.
*  We all sat out in the sun and at one point they would have slid my solar panel under my tent and I didn't see it.
*  So when it came for me to pack everything back into my tent, which I did put my head down fell asleep.
*  And then I always all of a sudden felt like nudging on the tent and something was yanked from underneath it.
*  And I just said hello.
*  And then someone was just running away and I thought maybe he came to say hi and I've just scared him off not realizing but then the next morning realized the solar panel is missing.
*  And then whilst I was tracking I clicked and thought okay, very clever.
*  Came back the next few hours later at dark took it from underneath and ran.
*  So now what do you do without a fucking solar panel?
*  We have what I had to spare because at that point I took a trailer and the trailer weighed about 120 kilograms of everything that I had in it, which is about 260 pounds.
*  And so yeah, I with that journey, I made you moving the trailer.
*  So yeah, so with Mongolia, it's just strapped with me.
*  It's like a four point harness.
*  What on wheels.
*  So you're not just walking 4000 miles.
*  You're walking 4000 miles or 200.
*  No, so this is a whole different expedition.
*  Yeah.
*  So this takes out when it came to Rob and there was nothing in China.
*  Okay.
*  This is the okay.
*  So that's that but in China.
*  No, I had difficult situations with the authorities with the police.
*  They're trying to get bribes.
*  No, they were just I was in a sensitive area, you know, to get to the source the planning it took over two years.
*  So I need government support.
*  I needed national park access.
*  I needed and a green development foundation, which is like an organization to make me ambassador to make me doctor for a year to be able to get all of this access.
*  But when I went through the motions of getting these different organizations on board that would give me access to the authorities and allow me to get to the source.
*  It was it was my it was blows my mind.
*  Now is really really difficult to get off the off the ground.
*  But we did that but still we were so close to Tibet that Tibetan police would would come over and threaten to you know, get rid of us and reporters and whatnot.
*  So that came as a worry.
*  But again, I carried 13 different documents or stamped or official or signed.
*  So I had to show them that I had to use the satellite phone call into the Beijing team users translation.
*  I think that one time they made me delete all of the information all of the tracked information I needed for Guinness World Record.
*  They made me delete that but luckily was backed up because they didn't want to have me seen walk in this region.
*  It was quite sensitive there.
*  It's like but I was definitely in China and definitely in Qinghai province sensitive.
*  How so just because you've got to bet and you've got China and they're very close to each other.
*  So I needed to make sure that I was always in in China.
*  Sometimes you'd get the police come over.
*  Did they think that you were a spy or something?
*  What do they say?
*  Yeah, no idea what they thought but it came as a shock to them.
*  They were also very worried for my safety.
*  So there was that angle as well that they were saying once they found out was official it was legit and they apologize.
*  They'd actually follow me on the Chinese social media, you know, follow the journey.
*  So that was great.
*  But after that they did say we are just you know, bringing you in for your protection.
*  There's bears as wolves.
*  We've not seen a Western around here in a row how long so I got tricky and there was one stage where they they said you need to be on the other side of the river.
*  So they drove us 40 miles back on ourself to a bridge dropped us off on the other side and we had to do those 40 miles all over again.
*  That was day six into the journey and we were desperately trying to get off the mountains.
*  Now we just dropped back 40.
*  We had to walk those four miles again.
*  No way around it.
*  Nightmare.
*  So yeah, it was really tricky.
*  This source around that area really sensitive and it was just and then we found that the locals would call the police as well.
*  They would radio to the next girl to the next girl to the next girl until eventually there was so phone signal and they would call the police and the police would often rock up at 2 3 o'clock in the morning just to attend at the location bang on.
*  They rocked up.
*  What are you doing here?
*  So we found out that the locals are amazing very hospitable, but they were worried and they didn't know if it's you know, Weston do they report it?
*  Will they be in trouble if they don't report it?
*  So they did so it came it pretty much went from mission Yancey to almost mission escape and evade.
*  We had to escape the sensitive region that we were in but we had to evade the locals because we realized that it was them calling the police that went off about three weeks.
*  Maybe think that you were an escape fugitive.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you think of a fugitive from America or the UK is trying to get away.
*  Yeah.
*  What better way to just jump into the middle of nowhere in China and walk.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah, potentially or just again.
*  Look like a fugitive.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe some sort of bank robber type.
*  I'd say Guy Ritchie movie.
*  There we go.
*  So you are avoiding this sensitive area.
*  So the sensitive area that's close to the Tibet and Chinese border.
*  Did you anticipate any of these things beforehand?
*  Like did you guys sit down with the team like when you were and do you say, okay, this could go wrong?
*  That's it wrong.
*  How many things did you figure could go wrong?
*  That is so many things that could have gone wrong that luckily didn't.
*  This was really sketchy.
*  Just the Yangtze is just known it cuts through a lot of diversity.
*  It's a beautiful stunning part one of the beautiful places that I've been but there are sensitivities.
*  There is the elevation.
*  There is the the wildlife.
*  There's the temperatures as well.
*  Did you ever see that video of I don't know if the girls from China or from Japan.
*  It's turned out to be fake, but she's snowboarding and behind her you see a bear running.
*  Yeah, I did see that video.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that possible?
*  It's not the video is fake.
*  Where is that in Japan?
*  Good question.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I think it's Japan.
*  Isn't it might be China.
*  I did see that they exist in Japan as well.
*  Right.
*  They do.
*  I believe so.
*  Can you Jamie?
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm double Google asking you.
*  Yeah, bring you.
*  Yeah, it's a fun video to watch after that picture of that Yangtze.
*  So she was oblivious.
*  She looks like a camera.
*  I don't think it's real.
*  I think someone just did some cool shit with CGI, but it looks pretty good.
*  Yeah, it looks like if it was in a movie like oh fuck.
*  Because the girls got headphones on she's fucking rocking out.
*  Yeah, do you see that tiger as well recently was India just sprints across the road and
*  how fast it was going.
*  See here it is.
*  So it's really well made whoever did it.
*  It's like she's got a GoPro.
*  Yeah, it's on the ground and then as she's going down the hill and her snowboard at a
*  certain point in time you look and see a fucking bear and she has no idea.
*  She's laughing and everything's cool.
*  And then watch it turn aside again.
*  Yeah, I think you see the bear terrifying.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah, what would you yeah, that's the second one is where I'm skeptical because it seems
*  like this fuck it looks pretty goddamn pretty damn good.
*  Doesn't it?
*  That would be hard to do.
*  Yeah, like the bear just gave up at that point.
*  Yeah, then that chick is flying.
*  I have never snowboarded from what I've heard from my friends when you snowboard.
*  It's easier to break your head.
*  Like you see your feet go up in the air and your head goes down.
*  Yeah, it's easier to break your head.
*  This girl's a difficult snowboard.
*  I tried it.
*  Supposed to be Japan.
*  Yeah, I've got that tiger one.
*  Tiger one.
*  This is the one recent.
*  Did you ever see the one where the dudes I think he's in India and they're on a bike
*  like a motorbike.
*  That's the one I'm talking about.
*  And the tiger's chasing behind them.
*  Yeah, have you seen that?
*  Oh my god.
*  It almost gets them.
*  It almost gets them.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  That's definitely not edited.
*  It's chasing them too.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, that's...
*  Petrifying.
*  That is fucking horrific.
*  Here we go.
*  Here it is.
*  So these guys are on...
*  Look at this tiger just going for it.
*  Almost got him.
*  Almost got him.
*  No way.
*  Oh man.
*  Right about then that dude...
*  Imagine the adrenaline right there.
*  Is wishing he had the cash for a bigger engine.
*  Just right there.
*  Right there is when you...
*  Oh my god.
*  What a killing machine.
*  And so beautiful.
*  What a fucked up way to die from like the most beautiful thing nature's ever created.
*  Yeah.
*  If a tiger wasn't a murderous, horrific predator that definitely eats people,
*  you would look at it and go,
*  it was in a movie like Avatar or something like that.
*  A tiger doesn't even look like a real creature.
*  That's it.
*  It's so beautiful.
*  Oh, stunning.
*  They're all beautiful creatures, aren't they?
*  Beautiful and spectacular and murderous.
*  And terrifying at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  Chasing you on a moped.
*  Oh, the speed as well.
*  Same with a bay.
*  You think they're gonna be slow but they can run.
*  Oh, they run way faster than people.
*  They run faster than Usain Bolt.
*  Crazy.
*  He can't even get away from a bear.
*  And if he touches you, all they need is one little ankle pick.
*  Yeah.
*  One little, just kick that ankle.
*  Woo!
*  You go flying through the air.
*  That's it.
*  Head first.
*  They tear you apart.
*  We came across bear footprints and we believe that the bear footprints were fairly fresh.
*  Maybe past our exact track that we were on in West China.
*  Show me with your hand how big it was.
*  Maybe about this big.
*  Oh, fuck that.
*  They've got a picture actually on the Instagram.
*  That's big, dude.
*  You've got a video actually.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Tibetan mastiffs as well.
*  Oh, dude.
*  You've got a Tibetan mastiff running up to me trying to attack me.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, the guy just steps in, throws the stone.
*  You don't see that bit but the Tibetan mastiff, yeah, there you go.
*  That's a pretty good size.
*  That's not as big as I was thinking.
*  But that's pretty big.
*  So that's its front paw, isn't it?
*  Yeah, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not a bear tracker.
*  And then it's like the back paw is almost like a human footprint, isn't it?
*  Well, the big brown bears, they have,
*  there's a photograph, a famous photograph of a woman who is a,
*  she's a wildlife biologist and they had tagged this grizzly to put a collar on it
*  or find its location or something like that or maybe do a test on it.
*  And she's holding its foot up and it is literally like a huge dinner plate.
*  Wow.
*  The foot, see if you can find that picture of a biologist holds up.
*  Yeah, I saw that one actually.
*  It was a massive one.
*  Holds up grizzly's paw.
*  Yeah, it is fucking huge.
*  And the claws on it.
*  Yeah, it's like as wide as my chest.
*  That's what the bear's foot looks like.
*  And she's holding, look at that.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at the fucking size of that paw.
*  You don't stand a chance.
*  That's so crazy.
*  It's so crazy that nature created that.
*  Just a cleanup system for the fucking woods.
*  Anything with a little limp.
*  Anything that's fucking around places it shouldn't be.
*  You're having too many babies.
*  Oh, I smell them coming to get them.
*  Done.
*  Fuck.
*  So here you are and you're out there with these things and you just have a little tent
*  and no weapons.
*  Yeah, and no weapons.
*  And there's three of you.
*  Three of you or four of you?
*  There was three for the first three weeks and then there was two of us for four days.
*  Then from then on it was pretty much solo most of the way for the first sort of half
*  of the expedition.
*  And then the second half was super interactive.
*  Opened it up.
*  People were joining.
*  Also people knew about it.
*  Yeah, it was pretty, it went pretty big in China.
*  We'd have journalists.
*  We'd have Chinese celebrities.
*  And they'd walk with you?
*  And they would trek with us.
*  Yeah.
*  We'd sometimes organize events where it'd be rock climbing.
*  We'd be teaching them how to belay off the clear thing.
*  Where like, do they have Instagram in China?
*  No, so I had to get all of the different social media platforms.
*  There you go.
*  That's pig's liver.
*  Whoa.
*  So they marinate it in vodka and chili.
*  And you're drinking it?
*  No, you're blowing it up.
*  Blowing it up.
*  That's pasherwum.
*  So that's like a rare delicacy.
*  You can eat it raw straight from the Yangtze River.
*  How sick did you get?
*  Yeah.
*  You had to have some serious stomach bugs.
*  Yeah, over the past decade, I've eaten all sorts, the lot.
*  So there's like towards the east.
*  So it was super interactive as well.
*  So these kids all knew that you were doing this?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's a news channel there as well.
*  And we were creating a documentary.
*  Oh, that's pretty cool.
*  At one point, it got pretty.
*  Good hospitality?
*  Yeah, amazing hospitality.
*  They were so friendly.
*  At one point, Adidas got wind of it.
*  And they invited me out to launch.
*  Do you know Jet Li?
*  Yes.
*  He had a co-branded range between himself and Adidas.
*  So it's like a photo shoot, GQ, Adidas, and Jackie Huang,
*  who's like a big movie star.
*  And I just jumped at the chance.
*  It was one day off, one day in Shanghai, straight back
*  into the wilderness.
*  And that was crazy contrast.
*  One minute in the wilderness, next minute,
*  flying out to Shanghai, got all of these stylists,
*  makeup artists, like whoa, photo shoot, buff, straight back.
*  Yeah.
*  And that was because they wanted like a face of the East
*  to represent the brand, but also a face from the West.
*  So it came from nowhere.
*  So it was great.
*  You know, lots of people started getting wind on it.
*  And I had to start, I think, eight to nine different social
*  media channels in China because they have their own platforms.
*  They don't have Google, Instagram,
*  Spandew, YouTube, et cetera.
*  So yeah, I had a great team, Mandarin Films and Beijing,
*  who really helped support, set all of this up,
*  and we were translating.
*  Was there a certain point in time,
*  knowing these people were going with you,
*  they're like, hey, bro, I'm done.
*  You're on your own.
*  And was that kind of weird, like when the crowds,
*  like when they're nodding back to being yourself again,
*  by yourself again?
*  That's it.
*  The second half of the expedition, it was OK.
*  So it was coming across many people.
*  But the first half, oh, man, the first half,
*  it got quite difficult.
*  Yeah, it was lonely at times.
*  It was boring.
*  Like the hiking, I don't really, it sounds funny.
*  I don't really particularly enjoy the hiking,
*  the dressing, the walking.
*  But that's what you chose to do for a whole year.
*  I know, right?
*  I can get pretty boring.
*  Well, if you eat porridge every day,
*  you're like, I don't really like porridge.
*  That's it.
*  It's actually, it's the survival, it's the challenges,
*  and it's the people you meet along the way.
*  So did you ever have a point where
*  you had large groups of people, but then not?
*  Yeah, quite often.
*  Yeah?
*  The largest we had was about 35 or 40 people.
*  And then afterwards, they went away?
*  Afterwards, they went away.
*  I was like back on the grind.
*  Yeah, pushing forward.
*  That must be the weird part.
*  Yeah.
*  A bunch of people join in with you, and then they're gone.
*  That's it.
*  And then you're just still trudging.
*  Yeah, and you've got to keep going,
*  get some Joe Rogan podcast on the earphones
*  as an air cracker.
*  There's only 290 days to go.
*  Look on the bright side.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  And the first part was more so, because the second half,
*  there was lots of people.
*  It was very interactive.
*  The first half, I had a UK photographer fly out,
*  Martin Lyons, and he joined me.
*  He was supposed to join me for two weeks,
*  but there was a terrifying landslide pretty much.
*  It just blocked the way, and there was only two options
*  to cross.
*  And again, this isn't his profession.
*  That's not what he does.
*  He's a photographer.
*  So he's come into my world, and he's
*  seen these two options.
*  Either one could go terribly wrong.
*  You drop in a hell of a distance,
*  and you're straight into the Yangtze River.
*  So he was supposed to join me for two weeks,
*  but he ended up going back on day number one after six
*  hours just because of the danger of trying to cross it.
*  And so that, for my mindset, having company for two weeks
*  with a good friend of mine as well from the UK,
*  I could speak, I can converse and communicate with,
*  to then having no one and back to my own.
*  It's still in the wild side of China, still bears,
*  still wolves, and I'm solo.
*  So that hit me hard.
*  I was like, damn.
*  Are you keeping a journal in your tent at night?
*  Yeah, I would actually stick to it.
*  I did on the previous expeditions.
*  With this one, I stuck to voice memos,
*  because it would capture my thoughts, my feelings,
*  my emotions.
*  And so I was, especially for the book,
*  I was capturing as much as possibly could.
*  And you're doing this with your phone?
*  Doing this with the phone, yeah.
*  Worrying about dropping your phone and losing everything?
*  I was.
*  Fuck.
*  I was.
*  I would try, each city I came across,
*  I just tried to back everything up.
*  With Wi-Fi?
*  And especially with like the, yeah, Wi-Fi.
*  What are you allowed to use over there?
*  Do you have to use an Android phone on their system,
*  on a Chinese system?
*  No, no, we were OK.
*  I just took my iPhone.
*  I was connected to all of their social media, of course.
*  I had my own bank account, transactions, all of that
*  with China.
*  So I was very much on the system.
*  But you can't use Twitter or Instagram over there.
*  No, you can't.
*  You've got to get a VPN.
*  What is that?
*  Oh, Virtual Private Network.
*  That's it, yeah.
*  So I thought it was like one of their apps.
*  So what are their apps that you're allowed to use?
*  What's their social media apps?
*  So they have like Weibo, which is kind of like an Instagram.
*  OK.
*  They have a WeChat, which is kind of, WeChat's clever.
*  It's kind of like a WhatsApp merged into Facebook.
*  So are you having to translate all of their comments,
*  like when they write things?
*  Or when they write?
*  Yeah, I can.
*  But sometimes it's too many.
*  You can't.
*  You've got to open it up on the VPN, open up the Google,
*  translate it.
*  I would just send it to the team.
*  The team would actually do most of the posting for me.
*  I send it to the UK team to post on the international social
*  media website.
*  Oh, so you could send them that post,
*  and then they could put it on Instagram or Twitter.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  I would send them like a voice memo or a message of text,
*  what to say.
*  Was there ever an issue with the Chinese government
*  that you were doing that through a third party,
*  that you were somehow or another getting the information
*  out to the real internet?
*  Not so much, no, because even the satellite that we had
*  to carry, I carried like a Navarino satellite,
*  Began system, if you like.
*  And that we had to register with the government,
*  and he had to sign off.
*  So they knew what I had with me.
*  And it was with that satellite that I was able to send
*  to the Beijing team.
*  They would forward on to the UK team.
*  And from there, we were able to make it one of the world's
*  most interactive firsts.
*  Did they have any concern at all about you using
*  the regular internet?
*  Like instead of just using the Chinese approved social media
*  sites that you were also using the other ones that were
*  international?
*  That's it, using international and the in China.
*  Did they have an issue with that at all, the Chinese people?
*  No, not that I'm aware of, no.
*  A lot of the Chinese are also on Instagram as well.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  How do they do that?
*  VPN.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  So a lot of them still try to.
*  So the Chinese government tolerates that?
*  Yeah, I think there's only a certain amount of lockdown
*  that they can have.
*  That's interesting.
*  There's a lot of Chinese travelers as well.
*  They go to these foreign countries.
*  They get the Instagram, the Twitter, the Facebook.
*  They get woke.
*  They get woke when they go to foreign countries.
*  So that's got to be weird using their governed approved
*  social media.
*  Did it feel weird while you were using it?
*  Yeah, I got so used to it.
*  I think there was 10 or 11 different social networks
*  that I was on.
*  It was mainly my team.
*  There was just too much.
*  Do they have more over there than we do over here?
*  Yeah, I'd say so.
*  And they're well connected.
*  Their phone is just like an extension.
*  Is it different?
*  So they have different things in what way?
*  In terms of like, do they have different apps
*  that they use more often or different things in their phones?
*  They have their own apps.
*  So they have everything that we have but converted,
*  just different.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, we have an issue in this country with Huawei
*  and a lot of these Chinese companies.
*  You can't even buy a Huawei phone anymore over in America.
*  But the ones that they sell over in China
*  are super sophisticated.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  They're like the top of the food chain phones right now.
*  Big time, big time.
*  And the cameras as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's what all of the Chinese love as well,
*  to be able to take good photos, good videos.
*  And that is just an instant sell of the camera
*  that's come with that phone.
*  Yeah, they've blocked them from Google though.
*  This is where it gets really interesting.
*  That's why I'm asking.
*  Google no longer lets them use Google apps.
*  So you can't use the Google Play Store.
*  So you have to either side load apps.
*  You could side load some apps.
*  Or you have to get the Huawei version of these apps.
*  So I'm like, I wonder if what happens,
*  like from the United States trying to stop them
*  from taking over.
*  And they're worried that it's a branch of the government
*  and they're going to get their hands in all
*  these different enterprises and businesses.
*  And they'll be able to spy on everything
*  and extract information because they can do that
*  with their Huawei devices.
*  I think that's how it, yeah.
*  But it's interesting that I wonder
*  if leaving them out of the system
*  will make them create a system that's better
*  and they don't even need our system anymore.
*  It's almost better to like.
*  Yeah, you know what, I think that's the way it's going.
*  You know, they don't have Google, but they have Baidu.
*  Baidu is just like Google.
*  But they can control it more.
*  They'll have whatever their version is of Wikipedia.
*  But it's all government controlled information now.
*  They got so many good, I think they've got an app as well,
*  like a delivery app where if the guy is like one minute late,
*  you can throw a complaint in and then it's free delivery.
*  Costs pennies as it is.
*  One minute?
*  Yeah, so sometimes you'll call,
*  I'm going to be a minute late, is it okay?
*  Can you not phone in because he won't get paid then.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's a deadline.
*  Yeah, and like even the bullet trains,
*  they're so advanced, the bullet trains leaving on the second,
*  let alone the minute, couple of seconds before the minute,
*  if anything, they're just so sufficient.
*  And you see that everything's in-house.
*  They got things cogging over there.
*  It's made in China.
*  They, it's almost like they don't need the rest of the world.
*  That's the scary thing, you know, it's really.
*  But it's again, a pleasant place to be.
*  I'd my friend, Martin Barrington, who's here as well,
*  say that because he joined me on Mission Yankee.
*  He had this idea that maybe it might be a little bit more
*  suppressed and when he joined me, it was like,
*  everyone's happy.
*  Everyone's doing their Tai Chi, dancing, everyone's active.
*  Really?
*  Strong sense of community.
*  And what part of China was this?
*  All over.
*  All over?
*  Yeah, all over.
*  So do you think that we in America have a misconception
*  of what it's like to be Chinese?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Not just in the US, UK as well.
*  I think most countries, yeah.
*  Do you think it's because we don't communicate or because
*  their language is so different?
*  They seem so different because they're, you know,
*  they're all the way over there.
*  Like what is it?
*  Yeah, I think it's just because it's so locked off, isn't it?
*  You know, it's they're locked off the grid.
*  They don't really shout about what they're doing.
*  Like right now, that we were saying before,
*  the amount of solar panels, wind farms,
*  they sent like, I think, 19,000 soldiers out to plant trees.
*  But all of that, they're not shouting to get attention.
*  They're just doing it.
*  And so I sometimes see that China aren't doing enough.
*  But on the inside, when I'm over in China,
*  I see it all, you know, like, whoa, we didn't know about this.
*  So I, you know, I'm to blame as well.
*  Before I went to China, I thought maybe it's going to be the same.
*  But that's why I go to these places, you know,
*  we get out there, explore its interior,
*  meet the people of the country.
*  And yeah, it's a pleasant place to be for sure.
*  That's pretty badass, man.
*  They get a totally different view of a country
*  than what most people do and to do it for a full year.
*  Do you think that's going to be a place you go back and visit now?
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I think it took off so well.
*  I had such immense support there that it'd be a shame not to continue it.
*  So I will be going back, you know,
*  me and the teams out there already looking at next ideas.
*  I'm sure you are.
*  So is that how it works?
*  Like, how much time do you take when you're done walking for a year?
*  How much time do you take before you go, okay, now what?
*  You barely know.
*  So as soon as I got back from Mission Yanxi,
*  I had an Asia tour, so I was straight back out there,
*  Korea, Singapore, Myanmar, and back out to China doing lectures.
*  I've been out there four times already.
*  It's going to be aired on CCTV, the documentary, and yeah,
*  I'm just, TEDx Talks as well.
*  So I'm all, I've been back four or five times already
*  since I finished only four or five months ago.
*  So every month I'm pretty much back out there.
*  When did you do the first one?
*  The first one, was the first one Mongolia?
*  So the first, yeah, was Mongolia.
*  That was 2013, 2013.
*  And how long did that take?
*  That took 78 days.
*  So it all pretty much started, you know, living in Wales there.
*  You know, I went from high school, went on to college
*  to do an outdoor education course.
*  I was working various different, so my first job,
*  what was it, 14, 15, fish and chip shop, $4 an hour, you know,
*  grinding away, and then I went into waiting on,
*  then I went into lifeguarding because I had that lifeguarding money
*  for a young teenager, 16, 17, it's pretty well paid.
*  And then it was from there that I started to save up
*  as much money as I can, got rid of my little jalopy of a car,
*  bought myself a little bicycle, cycle to and from work,
*  just saving the pennies, and eventually left at age 19.
*  And the first place I went was China, Great War.
*  I was only there for two weeks.
*  I left China.
*  When I looked back on the map, I thought China's a big place.
*  I barely even touched the surface, you know,
*  I need to get myself back there.
*  But after that, it was just various reckless,
*  extremely low budget adventures held around Southeast Asia.
*  When I say low budget, it's like buying a bicycle for $10,
*  finding string on the side of the road that we would use to strap
*  the rucksack onto the back with no pump, no puncture repair kit.
*  We're about to cycle over Cambodia, Vietnam, over 1,100 miles.
*  Why wouldn't you get a puncture repair kit?
*  Just saving the pennies.
*  We actually got a tent that was about, I know man,
*  we got a tent that was $5, found out the hard way it wasn't waterproof.
*  Just reckless, just silly things.
*  You made it on the bike though?
*  Made it. The bikes broke 17 times in total.
*  I was with my friend, Matt Norma, you know, both.
*  I named mine Little Elder.
*  A ridiculous, and I think the bikes may be on my Instagram.
*  Ridiculous little bicycle, basket on the front, a little pink bell.
*  Off we went, both of us.
*  Bikes broke 17 times in total.
*  How'd you get them fixed?
*  We would rock up at the locals
*  and just rock up, see if they can help and they would fix it.
*  Really hospitable.
*  Does somebody have to translate to you that?
*  Did you have a translator with you?
*  No.
*  No.
*  So we were just out there.
*  We just, you know, rock it with a smile.
*  I think smiling is the biggest communication sign, isn't it?
*  Sure.
*  They don't see you as a threat.
*  The barriers are down.
*  I'd point at the problem and then they would help me.
*  Right, if you walk in like a dick with a flat tire, that's not good.
*  Yeah, that's it. Exactly.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So we just rock up, even saw us out.
*  We were chased by dogs hit by mopeds, dodged by lorries.
*  So that was the first away from home adventure.
*  I'd say that that was the catalyst.
*  You said dodged by lorries.
*  Yeah.
*  What does that mean?
*  That the roads were extremely sketchy.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Enough only to...
*  How to translate that.
*  And they would be like coming straight down the mountain pass.
*  And they almost saw the brakes were working properly.
*  We're squeezing and it's going past us.
*  We're like, we need to get off this road, man.
*  We're panicking, trying to get, cycle faster.
*  But you know, after that, we just found my niche, found my passion.
*  Thought, wow, this is great.
*  It's cheap.
*  It's reckless.
*  But after that, we were in Thailand.
*  We hooked up with a local guy that said we can cross the border into Myanmar to a community.
*  It's like a Burmese hill tribe and we can learn jungle survival.
*  So we did.
*  We went there and it's this group living out there in the mountainous jungle region of the border of Tibet and Myanmar.
*  They were teaching us berries that act as a mosquito repellent.
*  You can pop them, rope them in your skin.
*  It'll repel the mosquitoes.
*  They were teaching us how to hunt, how to gather, what berries or what leaves were edible, what plants weren't edible,
*  how to build rafts and shelters using natural resources, you know, normally bamboo, banana leaves as a bed,
*  or as a slanted shelter for the rainwater to run off.
*  It was amazing.
*  We just continued these sort of adventures around Southeast Asia.
*  We hopped over to Australia, found some workers in Australia powering gas.
*  I think it was knocking on people's doors.
*  I thought this isn't me.
*  This is not what I'm traveling for.
*  I'm in a suit now and you know, I remember I was shadowing my boss.
*  We walked up to this drive and there was this guy at the end of the drive doing all of these pull-ups.
*  At that point, I'd become quite unhealthy, put a bit more weight on.
*  I wasn't sticking to the train.
*  I wasn't sticking to a good diet.
*  He jumped down.
*  He wasn't interested in the Australian powering gas.
*  But he mentioned something like, yeah, I respect you guys out here 40 plus degrees Celsius, 108 Fahrenheit.
*  Knocking on people's doors in the suits trying to sell them a good deal.
*  And one of my boss replied something cringe worthy.
*  Said something like, yeah, but we get paid a lot of this.
*  You know, I drive a Skyline so unnecessary.
*  And the guy replied, the guy who was doing the pull-ups, it's not all about the money.
*  It's the lifestyle too.
*  And all of a sudden that was a slap in the face for me.
*  That's why I started to travel.
*  The next day I quit the job, got myself a little bike with my friend again.
*  And we just carried on, cycled to Australia.
*  So you think your boss saying something douchey that sort of leaned you in the right direction?
*  Yeah, I was thinking for a while, this isn't me.
*  You know, this isn't, you know.
*  Foolish.
*  Yeah, yeah, I was doing something that wasn't right.
*  But his behavior is foolish.
*  Oh, I know his behavior.
*  That was the sort of, so I was looking at this guy and I was like, I'm not stood on his side.
*  I'm stood with him.
*  This is the way that I'm going.
*  This is my boss.
*  Right.
*  He would eat like fast food every single morning, you know, KFC.
*  And I was just like, this isn't how I'm man.
*  Sometimes you just need someone to say something like that, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Little nudges.
*  And I've had a lot of those little nudges along the way that if it wasn't for that nudge,
*  I don't know, maybe I would have just continued and no idea.
*  Yeah, I think we all had encountered those.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  So you said you got robbed that one time where they stole your solar panel.
*  That's it?
*  So yeah, what's...
*  It seems like you would get robbed a lot.
*  Madagascar.
*  Madagascar was more sketchy, I would say.
*  What was that like?
*  We'll come to Madagascar.
*  But yeah, so just before, after that Australia cycle and before Mongolia, it's like this links us into the Mongolia.
*  It's actually them working in Thailand because the money was so low.
*  I had to find work as a master scuba diving instructor.
*  But I was also doing the Muay Thai out in Thailand, which was awesome to see their discipline, you know,
*  beating their shins.
*  Had you ever done it before?
*  No, I come from a boxing background, so I was doing boxing in Wales.
*  Did you know how to kick at all?
*  Nope.
*  So I went, I learned the hard way.
*  I learned such the hard way actually that I, you know, I had the boxing stance, left foot in front.
*  And the Muay Thai stance is more square on, it's different.
*  And they just jacked my leg up instantly.
*  Jacked it up.
*  Just kicked, they didn't need to get into no fists with me.
*  It was just jacked my leg up.
*  The next day I had to cancel work.
*  I couldn't climb out of the ladder with all of my scuba diving kit because I couldn't bend my leg.
*  And from there I just corrected.
*  I was training five, six times a day, killing my nerve endings on the shin.
*  I just loved it.
*  I had a stadium fight.
*  Did you?
*  Yeah.
*  Which stadium?
*  It was in Koh Tao, a little island in Koh Tao.
*  So a guy sailed from mainland over to Koh Tao and the winner, the loser, you can make money, of course,
*  you know, so that was kind of my way of paying the rent.
*  If I won, you leave with money.
*  If you lose, you leave with nothing.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, and you've got the locals around the ringside sort of banging down on the canvas,
*  holding money up there, either pointing at you or pointing at your opponent.
*  How do you know when you take a fight like this that it's well matched?
*  Yeah, well, you don't really.
*  So that was my first stadium fight and apparently this guy, my opponent, that was his sixth.
*  But we looked similar height.
*  He looked to be maybe more experienced because of the fighting, but hadn't been fighting since a young age,
*  like a lot of the ties have, you know, they start from such a young age, as you know.
*  And so, yeah, it was a little bit on my heart.
*  I was just like, right, done my training.
*  It was about, what, how many, five, six months in.
*  So that's pretty fast, you know, straight to the end.
*  And you said you had boxed before that?
*  I boxed before that.
*  Had you competed?
*  No, not competed.
*  So it was just amateur fighting.
*  Look at you.
*  Yeah.
*  Wah!
*  That was in, yeah, that's Madagascar.
*  That's actually just playing around with my guide.
*  But I love it, yeah, the one tie.
*  So you, how many fights did you have over there?
*  It was probably about eight club fights, but only one stadium fight.
*  The one stadium fight was the big one, you know.
*  You won that, paid for about two, three months' worth of accommodation.
*  I was good. I needed it.
*  You don't earn much money as a scuba diver in Thailand.
*  Working myself.
*  So you won your stadium fight.
*  Won the stadium fight, yeah.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  What made you stop?
*  Mongolia.
*  So I loved this lifestyle.
*  I was doing it for like two years, like living in Thailand for two years.
*  But I was like, I missed trekking the Himalayas.
*  I missed my time with the community, the Hill Tribe in Myanmar, cycling Vietnam.
*  So I was like, I need to do something, you know, big, something that'll take me to a country that I'm very unfamiliar with.
*  And that brings in Mongolia.
*  So that was the first world, first record.
*  Not the first to attempt though.
*  A guy from Britain had attempted on three occasions, unfortunately evacuated just before the halfway point.
*  Tell people what the record is.
*  So it was the first to walk solo and unsupported across Mongolia's length.
*  So it was from west to east.
*  And when you say unsupported, does that mean there's no one monitoring you at all?
*  That's right.
*  So you're on your own.
*  You're trekking by it apart from the people that you see along the way, the communities.
*  Unsupported meaning everything that I needed to make the journey from start to end point was in the trailer that I was pulling.
*  And it was a bog-standard trailer built in a family friend's back garden.
*  So you said this trailer weighed 200 and what pounds?
*  Yeah, 120 kilograms, which I think is 260 pounds.
*  Here you are pulling this thing with a four-part harness.
*  First of all, that's hard.
*  That's hard to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it a flat road like that?
*  So this is entering the Gobi Desert.
*  So it's three weeks over the Altai Mountains, five weeks across the Gobi Desert and a further three weeks up through the Mongolian steppe.
*  So the Altai Mountains were excruciating, you know, it's no suspension, of course, on the trailer.
*  Even one little pebble or stone gets in the way and you know, you're struggling to...
*  This is a sandstorm that I came across.
*  It's actually one of the smaller ones.
*  What?
*  That's a small one?
*  That's the small one, yeah.
*  It's so painful as well.
*  Have you ever been in a sandstorm?
*  No.
*  So it picks up the stones and grids, whip and effect.
*  Well, I could imagine it could be deadly.
*  You can't see anything, right?
*  Well, I've seen some of them that roll into Iraq.
*  There's soldiers that have taken videos of them and put them up on social media.
*  It's crazy.
*  It looks like something out of a biblical music, movie rather.
*  Yeah, scary.
*  Yeah, these giant clouds of dirt hitting your way.
*  Have you ever seen those, Jamie?
*  Sandstorm, pull up sandstorm in Iraq.
*  It's some of them are so insane.
*  Yeah, you see it coming.
*  You're like, what the fuck, man?
*  And everybody's just got to hunker down.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Just ride it out like...
*  Yeah, like I was able to...
*  Look at that.
*  That video is fucking bananas.
*  Al-Assad Air Force.
*  And as soon as it hits the wind, the disorient is darkness inside and you can't hear anything.
*  And you're going to get your tent and you're going to have to breathe through that.
*  Yeah, there wasn't one big enough, I would say, that I had to hide.
*  It was still big, but I carried on walking because sometimes it just come out of nowhere.
*  So I didn't...
*  It was more like this without the wall that you can see in the distance coming towards you like that video.
*  Go back on that, Jamie.
*  This is how you see the storm overtakes him and it literally kills the day and turns it into night.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it blocks out the sun.
*  This is where it's really crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you see this guy standing there and the storm starts to overtake him and everything starts to get dim.
*  And then after...
*  Look at that.
*  Look at the difference in the color.
*  So fuss changing as well, isn't it?
*  Yes.
*  And now they're in the middle of it and now it literally blocks out the sun.
*  They're in the center of that fucking horrific storm.
*  That guy's just walking around breathing.
*  Yeah. So that looks more like a dust storm where it's...
*  So kind of similar, but the sand, it moves.
*  It depends on the speed of the wind.
*  But with a sandstorm, you've literally got to cover up.
*  So you saw me with a mask with I had to wear gloves, I had to wear a fleece.
*  It's just pounding your skin almost like sandpaper, you know?
*  Oh.
*  So it is...
*  How long did that last?
*  They would last about 15, 20 minutes.
*  Do you keep walking or do you stand still?
*  I carried on walking.
*  Yeah, I did carry on walking.
*  You can see where you're going?
*  Yeah, as long as you've got the heading on the compass, just keep going, keep going east.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're also following a track.
*  So this was the...
*  So I almost actually lost my life in the Gobi Desert.
*  So I was trying to follow a track and the track is like your lifeline.
*  If you're not following, if you're off the track, it could be hundreds of miles.
*  The track is where there's a water source.
*  There's a well always alongside.
*  But the Gobi took me five weeks to get across.
*  So week after week, I was suffering slowly with dehydration, heat exhaustion.
*  Slipping into heat stroke, which is usually fatal.
*  I had this big 20 litre water container.
*  Sort of remembering just rationing my last remaining dribbles of water, if you like.
*  I was hallucinating.
*  Got such to a bad state.
*  One of the water wells was dry and I had to push on to the next one, the hope that it had water.
*  It was a mix of hard sand or gravel and soft sand.
*  So now you can imagine pulling the wheels through soft sand.
*  They were just digging.
*  It was like pulling a concrete block through hell.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, and I was just...
*  I got really skinny.
*  I got really weak.
*  The weeks went by.
*  I was disorientated.
*  I was hallucinating.
*  I was sort of could feel my organs drying up, if you like.
*  It was at the point I just continued to rest under my shelter.
*  It was 40, 45 degrees Celsius.
*  No breeze, no natural shelter.
*  The only shelter I could find here was underneath the trailer.
*  I remember just lying there on my back for about 45 minutes to an hour.
*  Thinking, what have I done?
*  You know, I didn't have the evacuations the previous guy had.
*  No helicopters going to come and rescue me, you know.
*  The only backup that I had was my logistics manager, my fixer in the capital city.
*  I needed to allow at least three to four days for him to get to me,
*  and at least another day or two for him to get me out to safety.
*  Or I knew that there was a community which 100% had water.
*  It was about three or four days trek away.
*  And I continued and I pretty much passed the option of pickup at that stage.
*  The only way to make it was pushing on those extra few days to the community.
*  But again, four days is just too much for me.
*  I was in agony, man, absolute agony.
*  All of the thoughts, all of the feelings.
*  But that's when, you know, I've always been a big believer in breaking my goals down.
*  I couldn't visualize the three or four days, of course,
*  but what I could visualize is 100 meters.
*  I could see 100 meters.
*  So I was just, if I can rest for five minutes, not an hour,
*  and walk for 100 meters and then rest,
*  because that's all I could manage before I was just in a mess,
*  hide under my trailer again for another five minutes,
*  if I can continue to do this,
*  maybe by breaking my goals down,
*  after four days of 100 meters, I can make it to the community.
*  And I did just about, it was off the radars.
*  My urine was almost black.
*  You know, it was in a bad way.
*  Your what was black?
*  My urine.
*  Urine.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  So you probably had like severe dehydration.
*  Yeah, I was in an awful, I was lucky to make it.
*  If that community wasn't there,
*  if it had been abandoned, if the locals weren't there,
*  I definitely wouldn't have, wouldn't have made it.
*  Now when you walk into a community like this,
*  how many people were talking?
*  Like how big is the community?
*  Talking probably five, six huts, maybe 20, 30 people.
*  Wow.
*  Just in the desert, yeah.
*  And you just show up, some weird white dude.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Pulling a sled.
*  Pulling a big trailer behind.
*  And then you're like, yeah, I've been doing this.
*  There you go, so that's it.
*  Oh my God.
*  So with this, this is before I started feeling bad.
*  So with that, I had to run ahead of myself,
*  set up my camera on a tripod, put it on a video or even a timer.
*  And with this one, it was a video
*  because I was trying to show how difficult it was
*  to pull the trailer through the sand.
*  So I was leaning forward, it was 90 degrees, and each step was.
*  That's insane.
*  Agonizing.
*  How many miles in the soft sand did you do?
*  So it was five weeks in the Gobi Desert,
*  but not five weeks worth of soft sand.
*  I'd say maybe a week solid, but scattered over the five weeks.
*  Folks, if you want to, we're looking at a photo on the Instagram
*  of Ash pulling this sled, leaning into it like, dude,
*  you must kick ass at tug of war.
*  All you have to do is just go backwards.
*  Just think about how much time you spent dragging a fucking sled.
*  Your legs must be made out of steel.
*  It was painful.
*  It was painful.
*  You probably never get a chance to recover, right?
*  Because you're basically lifting a little bit of weights every day.
*  And you feel each step is just a run of lactic acids, you know.
*  It's horrible.
*  So this is why I was just resting awful.
*  Did you worry about rhabdomyelosis?
*  No, no, I was, look, you see, I'm still training in the Gobi Desert.
*  I was trying to keep my mindset, you know.
*  What were you doing there, showing that?
*  Oh, you're doing sit-ups up there?
*  I would try to stay regimented.
*  You know, I have no military background, of course,
*  but you know, the mindset, I was trying to stay focused.
*  I would do my push-ups, my sit-ups, always been keen into the fitness.
*  It's funny, actually, even when I came back from Thailand to attempt this,
*  I moved back in with my parents.
*  I had no money, of course.
*  They allowed me back in with them, which was great.
*  And I didn't even have money for a gym membership.
*  So I had my uncle drop me off a tractor tire, a local sledgehammer,
*  worked on like a bar, a bit of calisthenics,
*  and that's what I was doing out in the rain,
*  hardcore conditions of Wales,
*  flipping the tractor tire, beating it with a sledgehammer,
*  trying to prepare myself, not physically, but mentally.
*  You know, when you're in, as you know, you quilt cover at 5 o'clock in the morning,
*  you can hear it's howling with wind, rain outside.
*  The last thing you want to do is go out and train,
*  but I wouldn't have that option in Mongolia.
*  So again, you know, that's saying by putting yourself in more uncomfortable scenarios,
*  the more comfortable you become.
*  I was just trying to do that.
*  So did you develop some sort of a workout program?
*  I did.
*  You have to stick to a specific routine?
*  Yeah. What was your routine?
*  My routine was just full on calisthenics.
*  So it would be with the Mongolia, I was training for two, three hours a day,
*  five days a week.
*  So I was outside, I think actually on the Instagram, the highlights,
*  there's a section, fitness with a few different clips.
*  And it's, yeah, push-ups, sit-ups,
*  pull-up, flipping the track to tie it, sledgehammer work.
*  I was working on ticking off all components,
*  flexibility, agility, balance, speed, reaction time, coordination.
*  And I knew that my inner core was going to be crucial because pulling the trailer,
*  if you come over a stone,
*  you're literally, your hips are being pulled left and right.
*  So you need to be agile enough to be able to, you know, push on through that.
*  That's interesting about the core.
*  I didn't think of it that way.
*  Yeah, the core was vital.
*  Like all of these sort of pull-ups really helped as well for the...
*  Did you have someone coordinating this with you?
*  Did you get some advice from like a physiologist or a personal trainer?
*  I didn't know.
*  I'm sort of just self-taught, watched some clips on YouTube,
*  a lot of it through trial and error.
*  I was training since 13, 14, you know.
*  Based a lot around calisthenics and the martial arts help as well.
*  I took a lot from the Muay Thai and still implemented that into the training regime.
*  I'm just, I love it, body movement.
*  It fascinates me. I love the training.
*  I get super ratty as well if I don't train, you know.
*  I've got to, even training today in LA, went over to the pier,
*  got some rings there, I was straight there.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Lost a lot of weight.
*  So I'm trying to, you know, put some weight back on me as well.
*  I love it.
*  And the fitness is a crucial part.
*  Without the fitness, there's no way I would have made these expeditions.
*  I can only imagine.
*  Just seeing you pull that sled, I'm like, God, that looks like hell.
*  And the fact you're doing it at 100 yards, rest for five minutes, 100 yards.
*  I mean, just amazing that your body didn't break down just from overexertion.
*  Amazing what the human body's capable of in general, isn't it?
*  Yeah.
*  And I had huge fears and massive doubts before this expedition.
*  And that's sort of my message out to everyone is, you know,
*  you're far more capable than you think.
*  You always see little doubts into your mind, don't you?
*  And that's what I was doing until Mongolia.
*  I was like, you know, don't have your fear.
*  I think fear is healthy.
*  But doubt can be toxic, can't it?
*  Did you get tested for rhabdo?
*  If your piss is that color, that dehydrated?
*  I think I did.
*  When I got back, I was slightly worried.
*  Just my organ, what I was feeling with my organs, it was like they were drying up.
*  Just needed to check that everything was still functioning fine and everything was good.
*  The body recovers fast.
*  And I was only 24, I guess, then 23.
*  What, how much weight did you lose by the end of that?
*  So that was 78 days and I lost 13 kilograms in 78 days.
*  Which is like, that's what we were talking about earlier.
*  So that's 30-ish pounds.
*  Yeah, so I lost 13 kilograms as well with Mission Yanks, but that spread over a year.
*  So that was like very concentrated loss a lot.
*  I was having a ration pack at 5.30 in the morning.
*  I would, this was two weeks of the Gobi Desert or a week and a half where I'd wake up at 5.
*  I'd have a ration pack at 5.30 and I'd go a whole 14 hours before I had my next ration pack at about 7.30.
*  No food.
*  And burning insane amount of calories.
*  Yeah.
*  How many calories do you need a day just to sit, isn't it?
*  Like at least 2000 calories if you're doing like nothing, if you're just in it, you know?
*  Yeah, probably close to 2000.
*  Isn't it?
*  It depends though on your body weight.
*  And if you're just sitting around, obviously it'd be less than some of those moving around, but everybody's varies.
*  That's a crazy thing to do to slowly starve yourself while you're pulling a sled through stiff sand.
*  Cheese on toast was in my mind the whole time.
*  I'm sure anything just food.
*  Get it in there, man.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know the guys when I rocked up to that community, super friendly, really looked after me.
*  Yeah.
*  And you didn't speak their language?
*  Didn't speak their language.
*  You know one funny story actually in the Altai Mountains, it was a Kazakh family.
*  So I'd always try to eat and rest up with them where I could.
*  So Kazakh family in their sort of hut in the middle of the Altai rocked up 45 minutes inside sipping on their chai, their tea,
*  eating whatever they gave me.
*  And towards the end I was like, right, it's been 40, 45 minutes.
*  I need to make a move now.
*  And just as I was about to say that I looked at the guy, the man of the hut.
*  It was a man and his wife, a girl.
*  He's looking at me very weird, you know, eyes slightly squinted, slightly closed like he's thinking of something, you know.
*  He looks over to his wife or his girlfriend and he looks back to me, back at his wife.
*  And then all of a sudden right there and then in hand gestures offered me, offered me his wife.
*  Whoa, right there.
*  I like that.
*  That's sort of ancient.
*  Does he do this?
*  No, he just point.
*  When you say hand gestures.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He pointed to the bed and then pointed at us and then I didn't know what to do.
*  You know, I was like, whoa, you know.
*  Was she hot?
*  No, no, not really.
*  No, he's trying to get rid of her.
*  That's it.
*  She's yours now, bro.
*  We just, it was awkward silence for about 10, 15 seconds.
*  We all exchanged and look, she was looking at me.
*  I was looking at her, oh, I just put on a fake laugh.
*  A couple of seconds later he left with me and I made a swift exit.
*  She continued breastfeeding a child.
*  So she was breastfeeding.
*  She was, yeah.
*  He wanted you to take a piece.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoo.
*  I was like, is it one of those things that this actually happened or will I leave and
*  they're having a big joke right now and they're laughing away at the fact that, you know,
*  you just never know, do you?
*  I'm going to guess if they live in tents in the middle of nowhere and there's five tents
*  and it takes forever to get there.
*  Those people are probably freaks.
*  They're probably doing some weird freak shit.
*  They probably have no attachment whatsoever to sexuality.
*  Or maybe it's like, you're here, don't you?
*  Like to be really hospitable.
*  Like that's super hospitable, you know, but you do hear old school exploration.
*  I've heard it before, but I didn't think in this generation, this day and age, that still
*  be going on.
*  Well, they're probably living like old school Mongolians did.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, they're just a little wild sexually.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, in the far west.
*  So that was a Kazakh family.
*  So they would have come over the border, which is like mountain.
*  You've got the Altai Mountains, almost separate.
*  So this was in Kazakhstan?
*  This was West Mongolia.
*  West Mongolia.
*  But there's a heavy population of Kazakh.
*  They're the ones that actually hunt, you know, the eagles, riding their horse.
*  They've got the eagle perched on their hand.
*  So foxes, wolves.
*  How different do they look?
*  They look like Kazakh is more of an area that's closer to what?
*  So Kazakh is right on the border.
*  So you've got Mongolia sandwiched between Russia up north, China down south.
*  Because just the name Kazakh.
*  Yeah, and then directly on the west, you've got Kazakhstan.
*  Ah, okay.
*  But yeah, I think that's the second largest landlocked country in the world.
*  Mongolia is the second largest landlocked country in the world.
*  Dude, and you're walking through this.
*  Yeah, walking.
*  So gangster.
*  And that was my first trip there as well.
*  So I didn't have the money to do a recce like I did with China and Madagascar.
*  I'd never been to the country.
*  I rock up with the trailer.
*  When you show up at someone's tent, do you offer them something for food?
*  Like how do you work that out?
*  I had a piece of paper translated.
*  It described who I was, what I was doing, why I'm here.
*  And you're hoping they can read in the middle of the note?
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Hope and some you're right.
*  Some couldn't.
*  But again, you know, you see a guy looking at a mess, you know, big beard down,
*  looking in pain, looking hungry, looking skinny.
*  You pretty much know straight away you need shelter, food, water.
*  So they did every time and they were they were so friendly.
*  So you were counting on people being nice to you.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah, and that's all I've ever done.
*  You know, I just, it's a human way.
*  I love it.
*  I love people.
*  They're just so so friendly, so hospitable.
*  Even the UK, cycling the UK is when I was 20, I was raising funds for the NSPCC.
*  It was illegal sometimes to camp in a city.
*  So go on knocking someone's door.
*  Knock, knock, knock.
*  Do you mind if I set up my my tent in your front garden or back garden, please?
*  Wow.
*  Only had the door slammed on me once.
*  Maybe it was an old guy, probably felt friendly.
*  He just looked at me, slammed, went back inside.
*  Archie bunker.
*  Yeah.
*  For some families.
*  Yeah, they were they were fine.
*  And that's amazing that you that but did you have any funds?
*  Like could you give them money for food if they weren't willing to give it to you for free?
*  Yeah.
*  What did I take?
*  So I took paper and pens for education purposes.
*  They love if you can give their child like paper, pens, the child's will just be kids will just be playing with that, you know.
*  So you had like a barter thing going on?
*  Yeah, almost.
*  But sometimes they just wouldn't accept it.
*  They just plainly simply like no.
*  I had that a lot in China as well.
*  So but you didn't have any money?
*  Did I have?
*  Yeah, I had cash with me.
*  But you never offered anybody any money for food?
*  Oh, no, did I?
*  No.
*  Yeah, no, maybe I did.
*  Maybe I did.
*  Yeah, but they would just again, they wouldn't accept it.
*  Especially if I was sleeping the night.
*  I would 100% I'd take it and they'd be like, no, no, they'd stuff it down my trailer.
*  They, you know, really?
*  Yeah.
*  And then I learned that was it.
*  Then I learned that it was offensive to offer them money because you're in their environment and they know for themselves.
*  If they see I had a guy once run run me down on a horseback from the distance coming at me at speed and it was all just to give me a bottle to take away with with tea inside.
*  So I try again trying to offer you came a distance.
*  I've been watching you for 10 minutes coming from a distance from a distance little girl just to give me hot water tea.
*  So yes, I learned that it was offensive to give them money.
*  It's almost saying that I'm better than you.
*  I have money you don't but they're rich in life.
*  They've got all of the livestock, the products they want to be given and you're in their harsh environment.
*  So I was like, wow, that's that's cool.
*  So that's why I stuck to the paper and pens.
*  Wow.
*  That's what a life changing experience that must have been.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Walking through a place where you don't know any language at all meeting these people and having them take you in and feed you.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was incredible.
*  Did it renew your faith in people at all?
*  What's that?
*  Did it renew your faith in people?
*  It did.
*  You know, I've never not.
*  I should say it enhanced.
*  I would say it enhanced.
*  Yeah, everywhere.
*  I everywhere all of the different countries and the travels that I've done the people have just been absolutely amazing.
*  And I'm always trying to give back in return.
*  Sometimes they'll take it which makes me happy.
*  Sometimes they're just not interested in they're like, no, I don't want your money.
*  I don't in China.
*  There was one that they gave me loads of food.
*  They gave me accommodation.
*  They then gave me breakfast.
*  They gave me three days worth of food to take away with me along the Yangtze.
*  And they just wouldn't accept my money wouldn't accept anything.
*  Then I'm like, no, man, you know, all the best.
*  Incredible.
*  Madagascar was a little a little bit different.
*  Madagascar was a beautiful country.
*  But down south, it's very impoverished people suffering with malnutrition malaria is big out there because I caught malaria almost died from it.
*  You caught malaria?
*  I caught malaria.
*  Yeah.
*  So you weren't on malaria medication either?
*  Yeah, I was on malaria medication.
*  I came across a community that had the suffering with bubonic plague such an ancient disease.
*  And they pretty much said I had two guides with me at this time.
*  So they were able to translate pretty much said stay in your tent.
*  You know, we've had relatives die.
*  We've got the suffering with the plague here that instantly made me feel a nervia on edge, you know, the rats and dogs running around you go away, go away zipped in.
*  So they would do the cooking and they bought me this eel.
*  Smell a little bit funky, but we were hungry.
*  Me and my two guys, we eat the eel for the next few days.
*  We were suffering with diarrhea.
*  And I believe that the anti-malarial pills, they only cover you up to 80% anyway.
*  It was going in one way out the other and I didn't have the full 80% protecting me from the strain of malaria.
*  I caught malaria and I it threw me back to the Gobi Desert to the symptoms and signs.
*  I was suffering with I felt like I was just suffering with dehydration.
*  I was I was getting weaker and weaker.
*  I was losing a lot of weight.
*  I was vomiting and it got to a point where days went by that I was like this isn't dehydration.
*  This is this is a disease.
*  I'm suffering with something bad.
*  I pushed on made it to a community that I knew had overland transport.
*  How far did you walk with malaria?
*  I think I probably walked four days or so with malaria.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah, it was brutal.
*  Oh, but at that time I had no idea.
*  Right.
*  So I'm like dehydrated.
*  So I should drink and drink and think and I'm going to get better soon made it to the community arrived at one of the nearest hospitals.
*  And she said you potentially made it in time potentially a few hours before you slipped into a coma.
*  And that's when I realized and then it was the deadly strain of malaria.
*  It's false.
*  You've got four different strains of malaria got the deadliest and usually kills you within 24 hours.
*  But I believe I lasted five days because I was taking the anti-malarials.
*  And then that one you can eradicate fully out of your system.
*  Now when you're on the anti malaria medication and you're shitting yourself,
*  so it doesn't stay in your system.
*  Are you taking more of it when you think you have it?
*  No, I wasn't.
*  I was scared to as well overdose because you can't you know, you can't you don't know how much is you don't know how much is still in your system.
*  So you can't just take a lot of take of it.
*  One one pill a day.
*  It was so that's what Justin Wren was saying that he experienced toxicity because he was taking five
*  pills a day remember when Justin was talking about that.
*  Don't have the anti malaria.
*  He's yeah, we actually researched that there's been problems with some troops that get on that anti malaria medication and they get really sick from it.
*  Yeah, actually doesn't it do something to your brain?
*  Yeah, remember that's the malarone that you tell me that's like a shot.
*  Yeah, those isn't it.
*  What stuff are you on?
*  What anti malaria on doxycycline?
*  That's 80%.
*  I think the marlone the marlone marlone.
*  How do I say how do you say it?
*  Marlone.
*  Marlone.
*  Malarone.
*  Covers you about 100% I think my dad was on that.
*  Is that how I say it?
*  Methlequin.
*  Methlequin.
*  That's right.
*  So that's a different one.
*  That's right.
*  So what's this stronger strain?
*  No, but he was on it and he's gotten it Justin.
*  He runs a charity called Fight for the Forgotten.
*  They build wells for the pygmies.
*  He's got he's got it three times.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah, and what strain is that?
*  Maybe it wasn't the one.
*  Yeah, that was it man.
*  Was it?
*  Yeah, that was it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I remember him talking about it because the three lower
*  strains you can actually remain dormant in your system.
*  That's what they said with him.
*  He got it again after you had it malaria drug causes brain
*  damage that mimics PTSD.
*  Fuckin a malaria drug the drug the drug the drug.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  Not even just malaria.
*  Yeah, I've heard of that before.
*  Yeah, I have heard of that before.
*  So I became I pointed out with malaria no more UK after
*  that because once I'd contracted it I was the lucky one
*  to survive and then as I pushed on still have four months
*  to go I got it in month one of a five-month journey to
*  walk to southern from to walk south to north of Madagascar
*  so it's at eight highest mountains along the way.
*  So it took a hundred and fifty five days this journey did
*  and it was 1600 miles slightly bigger than the Mongolia
*  journey and a lot of it was just machete in hand hacking
*  through the jungle leeches dropping down spider bites
*  hunting gathering you're hunting and gathering out there
*  to yeah in the jungle.
*  Yeah, you know what you can gather the local so I have no
*  military background at all doing this which is usually strange.
*  It's normally a military background to come into do the
*  survival but everything that I've learned I've tried to get
*  as much knowledge as I possibly can from the locals.
*  So like the mine the mine more Hill community Mongolia how
*  they survived Madagascar what's edible what isn't edible how
*  to build rafts Etc.
*  So I always try to take a small percent and that's what you
*  can ever take because they're so knowledgeable when it comes
*  to what they can eat and gather what they can't you know,
*  it's a lifetime isn't it?
*  So I just had to try to pick up as much as I could in a
*  short space of time.
*  But again, I was learning as we went we were yeah doing some
*  hunting doing some gathering but we were losing weight.
*  Yeah, I took there was three or four weeks of jungle territory
*  further up north of the island.
*  We had a photographer join us for that one and it got to a
*  point where they just hated it.
*  I did too.
*  It was the cyclone season.
*  We were covering we were walking about 14 hours a day and
*  we would cover maybe three miles if we were just hacking
*  through a sheer dense jungle up and down mountains one day
*  we had to turn around and do a u-turn and walk three days
*  back on ourself to find a different way up the mountain.
*  No, I would put into perspective now and you do a u-turn
*  in a car.
*  I'm like right just a u-turn.
*  Yeah, three days.
*  Now when you say gathering you mean like stuff to eat.
*  Stuff to eat.
*  So how do you know what you can eat and what's not going to
*  again, we kill you.
*  We had the the local guides there.
*  So I had a local guide Max who was nails proper Bushman.
*  We were collecting chilies.
*  That's such a great English statement nails proper.
*  It was nails proper Bushman.
*  You said that in America.
*  What the fuck did you just say man?
*  Nails proper Bushman.
*  What the fuck does that even mean?
*  Nails proper Bushman.
*  Yeah.
*  So like what kind of stuff did you guys gather?
*  What did you eat?
*  A lot of fruit a lot of plant-based.
*  Coconuts mangoes.
*  Oh we got excited.
*  Oh so you see wild mango trees.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah, we just scramble on up there throw them down ten
*  wreck the little rodents kind of like head chokes
*  without the spikes.
*  They burrow underneath trees.
*  I see it took a shelter with us.
*  Look at that.
*  And there's Max there.
*  That's wild man.
*  Just making this little campfire.
*  Yeah.
*  Cooking under the shelter.
*  So that was the shelter that you use most of the time.
*  That was it.
*  Yeah.
*  So you slashed it down the trees.
*  We did have a tent as well.
*  But yeah, depending on the weather we just get get
*  this one out.
*  You're sleeping with a lot of creepy coolies and whatnot.
*  But nothing really venomous in Madagascar.
*  Are you sure?
*  Got the boa constricted a snake.
*  But again.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  You have a machete right?
*  Did you keep that bitch gripped in your hand?
*  Got a machete everywhere that I went.
*  Yeah, we got lost a lot of the time.
*  There's a foe of me and Max trying to find our way
*  in.
*  We the team just got demotivated.
*  They just didn't have it in them.
*  And I was the same.
*  That's me all broken there with blood got a leech bite.
*  But again, like with anything, you know, I think no
*  matter what you do, you can't always be motivated
*  and like, you can be disciplined.
*  That was the difference.
*  We stayed disciplined and we focused on the little steps
*  50 meters rest 50 meters and rest.
*  I bet nobody appreciates a comfortable bed like you.
*  Oh man.
*  Everything's so convenient.
*  I get back home.
*  I switched the kettle on.
*  I can take a shower.
*  I can do whatever it's gonna toast.
*  Push it down.
*  It's gonna pop up when it's done.
*  When you're out there, you've got to stay alert.
*  You got to stay focused.
*  Yeah.
*  Attention to the smaller details but back at home.
*  Everything's just so and you do appreciate it more.
*  You get back inside.
*  Whoa, we don't know how comfortable we actually have it.
*  But your gratitude for that stuff must be off the charts.
*  Yeah, just from those experiences.
*  Yeah, but so yeah, no, I do suffer as well.
*  Sometimes I take it for granted after a few months of being
*  back.
*  Get used to it.
*  Yeah, I have to throw myself back to the Malagasy jungle
*  and be like look, look.
*  Yeah, you're soft.
*  It could be worse.
*  That's how many you so how many all told of these crazy
*  journeys have you been on?
*  Whoa over the past decade now.
*  So the three big ones of course the Mongolia, Madagascar
*  and the biggest one the most ambitious was was Mission
*  Yangtze.
*  I wanted to see a photo of the the Yangtze River.
*  You were talking about how beautiful it is.
*  Yeah, I think on the Insta highlights you've got
*  2019 it starts with but you can see it goes right from
*  West goes down South curls back up and ends in Shanghai.
*  So there's these three big giant ones, but then there's
*  some other ones.
*  Yeah, so there's the Vietnam Cambodia cycle.
*  There's trekking Himalayas, which was a scary one because
*  we wanted to check the Himalayas.
*  They said that we needed to buy a permit, but we didn't
*  believe that we did.
*  He was like a way to get money out of it was we were
*  shoestring budget travelers and we were like now we can
*  do this.
*  Let's let's go.
*  He got it got worse.
*  He got to a point where it was like, you know, you can't
*  go the Pakistan Army roamed the border of Indian
*  Himalayas and Pakistan Himalayas said you go on your
*  knees.
*  If you come across the Pakistan Army put your your
*  thumbs behind your ears and say Allah harigbee repeatedly
*  and that like sort of means Allah have mercy on me.
*  So it's at that point we were like should we check the
*  Himalayas?
*  So we almost failed with that one.
*  Yeah, yeah, it was insane.
*  So they taught you how to beg for mercy if we came across
*  the the military.
*  It's that much of an issue.
*  I thought that was his way of trying to scare us to get
*  us to pay for a permit that we didn't need.
*  How much was a permit?
*  I have no idea.
*  I should know this should be if it was reasonable.
*  I would say probably we yeah, we were such budget.
*  It was crazy.
*  That's so crazy.
*  You got like little hammock hammock shops in Vietnam as
*  we were cycling.
*  Sometimes we sleep in the hammock shop.
*  It would cost you about 20 cents for the night in a
*  hammock shop hammock.
*  So you test the hammocks.
*  Yeah, that's a good deal.
*  Great that hey, yeah, good sleep.
*  It's not hotel.
*  You don't have your toilets don't have any of that but so
*  hammocks if you're in a real woody area that seems like
*  not a bad option.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you get one?
*  No, we were only stuck to the hammock shots because we
*  were on a bicycle.
*  So we were on roads.
*  So that wasn't necessarily how much of the hammock way.
*  Oh, you can get super light ones.
*  Now you probably get one for a kilogram maybe even yeah
*  around a kilogram.
*  I'd say maybe even lighter.
*  Yeah, that would be a great way.
*  If as long as there's enough trees.
*  What a great way.
*  Yeah, you screwed in the goby desert on you.
*  But you're taking a way off the ground with all the
*  creepy crawlies.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Did you get stung by any creepy crawlies?
*  I did spiders spiders.
*  I was so when you're hacking through the jungle, you've
*  got the jungle canopy and the leeches believe or not.
*  Oh, what is that?
*  Yeah, fuck man.
*  How do you know that that's okay?
*  So when it's happening, are you worried?
*  I didn't feel it, you know when it happened because as
*  you hack hacking through the jungle, you've got loads
*  of bamboo shorts and they are razor sharp.
*  So you just get scratched everywhere.
*  You've got leeches at the nighttime.
*  You take your top off and you've got to apply six
*  seven leeches off your body.
*  Frick them up the tent.
*  You've got this bite which infected.
*  There's a lot of aloe vera plants around that area
*  though, so you can just rip off the aloe vera.
*  Yeah, that looks really infected.
*  It looks so lit up.
*  If you click on that photo with me standing on the
*  rock with the dragon, you notice anything weird
*  about that image?
*  Um, you got a bird on your back?
*  Gertrude.
*  Who's Gertrude?
*  Gertrude the chicken.
*  So in order to summit the highest mountain in
*  Madagascar, you got to bring a chicken.
*  It's tradition.
*  You must take yourself a white cockerel, protect it,
*  keep it alive and it protects you from the bad
*  spirits and witches of the rainforest, the locals
*  say so.
*  I'm all about respect in the local culture, of course.
*  So you have to bring a chicken.
*  How long?
*  I took a chicken.
*  How long are you carrying this chicken around?
*  How many days?
*  Two and a half weeks.
*  Two and a half weeks.
*  Oh my god, that's so crazy.
*  So you have to feed the chicken, you have to let it
*  shit?
*  Yeah, it shat all in my bag, shat all over my tent.
*  It would sleep on top of my tent.
*  Oh my god.
*  It wouldn't leave me.
*  Became domesticated like a little dog.
*  It became your buddy.
*  Yeah, it just followed me around everywhere.
*  Oh my god.
*  Two and a half weeks, chirping in my ear, praying
*  for a little bit of rain because when it started
*  raining, he would tuck himself inside the bag.
*  You wouldn't make noises, but imagine 14 hours,
*  you've got this chirping chicken on your shoulder.
*  Now, is he just perched on your shoulder or do you
*  have him strapped down?
*  He's in the top compartment on the bag.
*  So you have him strapped in?
*  We have him strapped, zipped in.
*  Yeah, he can't really get away.
*  No, he's got like his head out to breathe.
*  He's like, what in the fuck is going on?
*  Yeah, going through the jungle.
*  So that's why we let him out a lot of the time.
*  He'd just be running, trailing behind us.
*  Wow.
*  It's great.
*  And you've got to leave him on top of that mountain.
*  So that was his freedom day.
*  That is so ridiculous.
*  He's just hanging around with you.
*  Yeah, that was a couple of days in.
*  Do I?
*  I don't like I do, but I don't know if it's on my Instagram.
*  That is hilarious.
*  But yeah, you and your boy are just chilling with a chicken.
*  There we go.
*  By the way, that guy has like woman's dress shoes from the 1950s on.
*  Yeah.
*  What are those shoes?
*  Man, sometimes he'd walk barefoot and it was only when I said you've
*  literally missed a scorpion by a foot.
*  Those sandals look like a five-year-old girl would wear.
*  Yeah, they are.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hilarious.
*  And that was the nails Bushman.
*  Oh, look, he didn't give a fuck.
*  He doesn't care.
*  Yeah.
*  He's just there to hike.
*  That is a crazy fucking chicken, man.
*  That whole thing.
*  That's so strange.
*  At the end of it.
*  Did you eat it?
*  No.
*  So we have to set him free on top of it.
*  We can't even take him back down.
*  So I was hoping he'd follow us down, you know, build a bit of a bond
*  with a flaming chicken, you know, but he didn't.
*  We couldn't eat him either because they say that the bad spirits
*  then go inside.
*  It seems like a bad idea if you eat him.
*  Yeah.
*  He's your pet.
*  No barbecue sauce either.
*  He's your pet.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless you were starving, right?
*  What would you do if you're stuck and you're starving?
*  We would have no choice.
*  Would we?
*  Yeah, we have no choice.
*  Survival first.
*  But then you would be worried about the spirits.
*  Exactly.
*  And if we took him down to a community, that community would
*  apparently flip on us, you know.
*  Oh really?
*  We'd be introducing the witches and the bad spirits.
*  Witches?
*  Yeah, they believe in witches.
*  Chickens carry witches with them?
*  Chicken.
*  No witches are scared of white chickens.
*  So that's why we needed Gertrude.
*  That is hilarious.
*  They believe in witches.
*  Witches.
*  Yeah.
*  What do they think witches are?
*  They got some mad stories as well.
*  So Max, my guide, he said, so my take on it is we were in the
*  middle of this community, deep in the jungle, high up in the
*  mountains in the middle of Madagascar, you know, the
*  fourth largest island in the world.
*  And we came across a community and they allowed us to stay in
*  their little wooden shack sort of hut.
*  And I woke up about two o'clock in the morning, let's say,
*  I don't know what time, two o'clock in the morning, and it's
*  Max coming in.
*  He should have been sleeping right next to us.
*  It was Max, my photographer, me and Lever, the chicken next
*  to Max Gertrude.
*  And he came in with this machete.
*  I was like, you're right.
*  He's like, yeah, yeah, good.
*  Anyway, his story is that me, Lever and Suzanne were all
*  convulsing in our sleep, all shaking.
*  And then he looks up to the door and the silhouette of this
*  lady was stood on the outside from the moon, stood on the
*  outside of the door, peering in.
*  And he shouted like, hey, you know, get away in Malagasy.
*  Anyway, he was freaked out.
*  We were all free still cursed.
*  I have no, I don't remember any of this.
*  I was thinking now, come on, you got to be lying.
*  Takes the machete and then he chases this witch like figure
*  into the jungle runs about hundred meters.
*  When she enters the jungle, boom, she disappears.
*  And then when he walks back to the, to the hut, he said,
*  you'd stopped convulsing.
*  You woke up Ash and asked if I was all right.
*  And I was like, no.
*  And I was like the only one that I felt I was the only sane
*  one there saying, come on, that's got to be a load of
*  rubbish or like, wouldn't you sleepwalking?
*  Suffered with a night terror, maybe.
*  Or, and he said, no.
*  And the only reason that I wasn't convulsing is Gertrude
*  was sleeping next to me.
*  So I was like, Whoa, Susanna, our photographer from Belgium,
*  which is absolutely bricking us off then, you know, just
*  like what is going on?
*  Where are we?
*  It's like, have we got the Blair Witch project?
*  Yeah.
*  So you're stuck in this tent now with people that are crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And the witches are like peering into the, like you got to
*  be weirded out.
*  And they're all telling me their individual stories of
*  their witch experiences as well.
*  Great.
*  But they were very, you know, there was a time with my two
*  guys, we had many crocodile rivers to cross.
*  Oh, fuck dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Madagascar is full of crocodiles and sometimes they
*  would, they would ask the local community, you know,
*  whether it's safe to cross.
*  And I would say, how do they know safe to cross?
*  And he replied once, well, they've made a deal with the
*  crocodile.
*  So what do you mean?
*  They've made a deal with the crocodile.
*  So yeah, the, you know, they've, they've rocked, the
*  crocodiles have promised that they won't eat the locals.
*  If the locals let them be and leave them alone.
*  So you're going to cross that crocodile infested river on
*  the hope that some contract has been signed or some
*  handshake.
*  Give me photo proof.
*  You know, they're like, yeah, I'm doing it.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  I'm building a raft.
*  I'm finding a different way, you know, even a raft.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though, and we did it took us four hours to construct
*  a raft.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to get to the other side.
*  Never knew what was in.
*  You must've been shit in your pants.
*  Just looking down at that water.
*  Yeah.
*  Crocodiles.
*  Yeah.
*  They target people.
*  They do.
*  This is always three ways to cross a river, cross where
*  the locals suggest.
*  If there's no locals cross where there's white water,
*  rapids.
*  If there's not that either, then yeah, a raft is the
*  final option.
*  There's a terrifying story about these explorers that
*  were, I think they were on the Congo and they, they
*  were in kayaks and the guy in front of them got attacked
*  by a crocodile and the guy watched the crocodile come
*  up, grab the guy, flip the kayak under and then pull,
*  and then pop the kayak pops up without the dude in it.
*  Boom.
*  And then the guy's gone.
*  Scary, scary story.
*  So reached up, snatched him out of the kayak and then
*  yanked him.
*  Ripped him off the rope.
*  Popped him out of the kayak and the kayak pops up and
*  the guy's like what in the fuck?
*  He's right behind him.
*  Why this thing happened?
*  His boy just got eaten by a dinosaur, you know, in a
*  crazy muddy river right in front of him.
*  He was like, fuck.
*  What do you do?
*  Get to shore, get the heck out of there.
*  Did you see them?
*  No, we would again, super vigilant.
*  We crossed at the right places where there was white
*  water and where, you know, rafts, yeah, maybe they
*  could have been below, but luckily we didn't see them.
*  You didn't see them there at all?
*  Didn't see, no.
*  No crocodiles at all?
*  No.
*  No.
*  And it's all murky water so you can't even tell what life
*  they lived.
*  You know, but they can be, yeah, they can.
*  What is that?
*  1961, David Attenborough in Madagascar with the
*  crocodiles where they're worshiping them.
*  This guy's going to feed it?
*  Yeah.
*  What's he bringing over to feed them?
*  Like, so they were just cutting it up here.
*  So this is the people that think they have a deal
*  with the crocodiles.
*  Yeah, this is long history.
*  Oh yeah, Madagascar.
*  So they've been feeding these crocodiles for a long
*  time.
*  That's probably the move, feed the crocodile so the
*  crocodiles don't get into hunting.
*  I mean, they want to preserve energy.
*  If they think they could just show up to the shore
*  and every day he toss them some food.
*  Yeah.
*  Look how evil these crocs look.
*  And the crocs know normally where the people cross
*  and they'll just try to stay away from human activity
*  normally.
*  But there are stories of people being taken, of
*  course.
*  Of course.
*  Look how evil that goddamn thing looks.
*  That doesn't give a fuck about you.
*  No, at all.
*  Yeah, you're not making a deal with a crocodile.
*  No.
*  And they were laughing at me saying, yeah, like,
*  of course we've made a deal.
*  I'm like, don't be silly.
*  And they're laughing because I'm weird.
*  It's like, come on.
*  But they also believe in witches too.
*  But it's interesting, like, without the real outside
*  world, right, we take away the internet, take away
*  access to education, take away all the things that
*  we think of in the Western world.
*  And then in their world, like, even if witches
*  aren't real, if they operate that witches are
*  real, they're going to set these like very
*  specific patterns, things they're allowed to do
*  and things they're not allowed to do and that at
*  least gives them this idea that carrying that
*  chicken around is protecting them.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the chicken's going to protect you from
*  the bad witches.
*  Like, and they just keep living that, like, you
*  can't take a chance.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to take a chance and abandon the
*  chicken.
*  What if you get killed by a witch?
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to feel like an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So, yeah, yeah.
*  It's stuck in these patterns because life is so
*  sketchy there as it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Surrounded by dinosaurs.
*  You're hacking your way through fucking terrible
*  forests.
*  It's almost to protect them as well as at the
*  younger by creating these stories.
*  There was another one that if a leaf falls, if
*  you're resting in the shade, it gets hot in
*  Madagascar underneath the tree.
*  If a leaf drops, it means there's a snake in the
*  tree warning you to get out from underneath.
*  If the second leaf drops, it's warning it's about
*  to spiral down and spear through your skull.
*  And again, I'm like, that's impossible.
*  I'm like, no, no.
*  So I just wind them up.
*  You know, a second leaf dropped and they would
*  scat and I'd still be there like in another tree.
*  But I do love that.
*  You know, that's why I travel to amazing stories,
*  isn't it?
*  People living in so many different ways.
*  Big beautiful world.
*  Lots to see, lots to do.
*  And that's why, you know, a lot.
*  So with Madagascar, I pointed out with the Lima
*  Network Conservation, they've got 60
*  organizations on the ground helping to protect and
*  preserve the unique biodiversity.
*  So with these expeditions, it's almost the record
*  is like the enticement, the motivation.
*  But if I can do something worthwhile and highlight
*  certain issues.
*  So with Mongolia, I was actually raising awareness
*  about climate change and the effects that it has on
*  the nomadic way of life.
*  It gets so cold out there now that the livestock
*  struggle to survive, which means that the nomads
*  are out of work.
*  So they move to the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, to
*  find work.
*  But there's now like a Gur district or a Gurt
*  district, you know, their white felt tents are
*  surrounding the capital city and it gets free.
*  It's one of the coldest capital cities in the
*  world. It gets cold.
*  They burn what they can.
*  A lot of it is dirty coal because the clean coal
*  gets sent to China and plastics.
*  So there's now a smog that covers the capital city.
*  It's a difficult place to live in the winter only
*  and babies are lasting three, four days after
*  birth before they're suffocating.
*  Oh my God, just from the burning plastic and...
*  Yeah, just difficult to breathe.
*  Even the doctor just says evacuate the city, get
*  yourself out.
*  So I was just trying my best to raise funds for the
*  Red Cross, raise awareness of actually Mongolia
*  you don't hear enough about it.
*  Go to that picture again.
*  Make that picture larger, Jamie.
*  Look how crazy that way of life is.
*  Yeah.
*  There's all these tents everywhere.
*  In the background you see looks like some wall
*  tents, but maybe some hard structures.
*  Looks like there's a few hard roofs there.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  They'll be different huts.
*  They'll just be...
*  Most of them are just tents.
*  Yeah.
*  There's one building back there, a multi-story
*  building.
*  Scroll back, go back to...
*  So this is...
*  Yeah, see that one?
*  Yeah.
*  That looks like a multi-story building.
*  So this is in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.
*  So you have a lot even in the center, you know,
*  it's pretty nicely developed in there.
*  But it's crazy, right?
*  All dirt roads and what do they do with
*  sanitation and sewage?
*  Yeah, again.
*  I don't like hearing that noise.
*  Yeah, it says, though they lack access to drinking
*  water, proper sewage or internal heating, many are
*  reluctant to leave behind the unique millennial
*  old way of living.
*  Yeah, just shitting a hole in the ground.
*  Whatever, whatever, forever.
*  Yeah, so it's...
*  Imagine not wanting to leave that.
*  Imagine being like, this is the way to go.
*  Yeah, these were all out in the wilderness, in the
*  Mongolian wilderness.
*  It's absolutely stunning, but they've been forced
*  pretty much to move here.
*  So in the camp...
*  Stop that, please.
*  Go back up and make that larger again.
*  What is that background city?
*  What is that?
*  Ulaanbaatar.
*  Yeah, that's the capital city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar.
*  Wow.
*  And so all that stuff on the outside is how most
*  of the people live.
*  It's like a good district, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So you can, it drops to like minus, what, minus
*  40 Fahrenheit.
*  Fucking A, man.
*  And so they just need to stay alive, so they burn
*  whatever they can find to stay warm.
*  Jesus.
*  So there's always, you know, always environmental
*  up at my heart, first and foremost, especially
*  seeing the world.
*  You see it in its rarity, you know, you're out
*  Madagascar trekking its wilderness, and 80% of all
*  plant life and wildlife found in Madagascar alone,
*  it's found nowhere else in the world.
*  Really?
*  Literally walking past stuff on a daily basis
*  thinking you're not found anywhere else, only, only
*  native to Madagascar.
*  Giant Comet moths, this big bright yellow to lemurs
*  over a hundred different species.
*  So I do my best to try to meet up with as many
*  organizations as I possibly could, who are helping
*  to protect and expand national parks, who are
*  helping to educate the locals, supply different
*  means of work, protect the species living within
*  highlight, like the press were interested in the
*  journey, but I would direct and highlight, you
*  know, the real unsung heroes, I call them, the
*  people volunteering doing this day in day out.
*  And how often there's just a lot of you switch on
*  the TV and it's just all negative, isn't it?
*  But I believe positivity spreads more positivity.
*  So highlight these issues, all of the amazing
*  workers doing their utmost to protect the
*  environment.
*  And yeah, that makes you want to do more as well,
*  doesn't it?
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it seems like it's got to change your just
*  your frame of reference shifts.
*  You've seen so many things that most people
*  haven't seen just haven't been to that place and
*  knowing that there's massive groups of people
*  that are living like that that are burning plastic
*  in the wintertime to try to stay alive.
*  Yeah, it just shifts how you view things.
*  That's it for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, once you've seen it, you can't
*  unsee it.
*  It's one of those where you just want to try to
*  keep helping where you can.
*  That's how many people are living like that.
*  Oh, right.
*  So there's four million people in Mongolia, but
*  probably about three million are in the capital
*  city.
*  Probably half of that are good districts nomads.
*  Almost half maybe.
*  So more than a million people in tents.
*  Potentially it's getting that way anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  And the air quality just again, so poor.
*  Can you imagine that?
*  Just giving birth to the doctors of get out the
*  city.
*  Wow.
*  Why is there's a high chance that you're going
*  to lose your child and the people that do stay
*  the older people that must be taking years off
*  their life.
*  Yeah, most likely.
*  And then in the summer, so I didn't experience
*  in the winter, but in the summer you still got
*  the good district, but it's warm.
*  So you can see the sky.
*  What do these people do for a living?
*  A lot of the is livestock.
*  So they raise their the yak.
*  Dairy, you know, meats that they'll transport
*  over to the capital city.
*  But they're just out there living the purest
*  way of life.
*  I remember walking through a part of Mongolia.
*  Actually, I went over eight days without seeing
*  a single person for eight days.
*  I was like, wow, if you want to know what the
*  world was like, I don't know million, two million
*  years ago, Mongolia is the place that you'll get
*  to experience a bit of that, you know, just
*  wilderness just out there.
*  Did you encounter any wolves or anything there?
*  Wolves.
*  They were the bigger wolves as well.
*  They were gray wolves.
*  I didn't luckily saw footprints, but you can see
*  whether that was wild dogs or wolves.
*  I had a wild dog approach my tent like two, three
*  in the morning.
*  Just hit heavy breathing and footsteps outside
*  my tent.
*  I'm in the middle of the Gobi Desert alone.
*  Hadn't seen a human in days and I'm there in
*  the middle of a tent and knife in one hand a
*  torch in the other shake in adrenaline thinking
*  this is a person outside.
*  Oh my God.
*  Shouting and they're not replying unzipped.
*  It's like a wild dog, but it was fine.
*  Wasn't aggressive, aggressive, but yeah, it was
*  just so I remember my logistics manager my
*  Ulaanbaatar based my Mongolia based logistics
*  manager said to him can you imagine how quiet
*  how silent it's going to be in the Gobi Desert
*  and he replied he just said there's no such thing
*  as silence.
*  Do you mean there's no such thing as silence?
*  They have like silence rooms, you know,
*  torture panic room, the silence room with the
*  headphones and whatnot.
*  He was like, I'm not going to tell you, you know,
*  you'll get out there and if you've hit the right
*  spot of the Gobi Desert, you'll know what I
*  mean.
*  I did.
*  I remember I was just again in the middle of
*  the Gobi Desert.
*  I hadn't seen anyone days and there was no
*  breeze.
*  There was no flies.
*  There was no people.
*  There was just no noise pollution whatsoever.
*  And I was just looking around.
*  I could just hear this faint noise almost like a
*  a high-pitched humming noise very faint though.
*  I thought it could be like air leaking from my
*  water container could be my trailer.
*  So I walked a few hundred meters away from my
*  trailer and I could still hear it took me five to
*  ten minutes to figure it out that it was like I'm
*  at such the point of silence now so quiet.
*  I can hear my own body functioning and that's what
*  he meant.
*  There's no such thing as silence because when
*  you're at the point of silence, you can finally
*  hear your own body ticking over.
*  Never heard it before.
*  Never heard it since.
*  Well, like what are you hearing?
*  Just the faintest humming noise almost like it's
*  almost like coming from the inside, but you can't
*  not not hear it as long as you're living.
*  So long as you're breathing, you're hearing that
*  noise.
*  I went everywhere and I was just like, yeah,
*  nothing about this.
*  It's my body is ticking over.
*  So how long you walking through the Gobi Desert
*  here in your body?
*  Oh, no, when you walk in you can't really hear
*  it.
*  When you stop.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's got to be no wind.
*  A lot of the time it was very breezy.
*  Sometimes there were storms, you know, you see
*  you're essentially walking through a dead area,
*  right?
*  It's lifeless.
*  Yeah.
*  How much water you have on you when you're doing
*  this with that.
*  So my container was 20 liters, 20 kilograms, but
*  it was never always full.
*  That's a lot of weight.
*  That's a lot of weight.
*  Yeah.
*  Plus you have all the other stuff.
*  Yeah, that's why you're mounted really.
*  I think the trailer on its own was 40 kilograms
*  and what that is a pound 60 70 pounds maybe on
*  an empty load because it was mild steel.
*  Just built in my family friends back garden,
*  you know, really?
*  Yeah, just puncture proof tires full rubber.
*  So it was heavy, but it was robust and then the
*  water container here 20 liters 20 kilograms I
*  needed at a maximum load.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I was true effectively, I went through
*  the water when I was really suffering with the
*  dehydration.
*  So at that point the trailer was a lot lighter.
*  It was under a hundred kilograms at that point,
*  but I'm low on water, you know, right?
*  I'm sort of rationing the last remaining dribbles
*  up to where I make it to the community.
*  So on maximum load 120 kilograms water was the
*  biggest issue and always was the biggest issue.
*  That's where the previous guy was was evacuated
*  on three three occasions which terrified me as
*  well as a Navy soldier Desert Explorer.
*  I was just a scuba diver Muay Thai living in on
*  a beach in Thailand, you know, so I did have my
*  worries.
*  I did stop planning Mongolia as well because of
*  that started doubt myself at the same time.
*  I realized, you know, just because no one's found
*  a way to do something.
*  It doesn't mean it can't be done.
*  What made you feel like Mongolia was the wildest
*  place probably because it was really close like
*  I'm living in Thailand.
*  My initial I my initial idea is get a cheap bike
*  $10 cycle to Mongolia cycle across Mongolia and
*  walk back the other way or cycle to the start point
*  in the east and then walk to the West and I thought
*  if I did that would have died.
*  I wouldn't have made it.
*  I was lack of preparation.
*  So that's why I went back home back to the UK for
*  the right preparation the right training and again
*  as I say now, it's not like Vietnam the cycle when
*  it was all very reckless.
*  It was all meticulous planning detailed planning
*  and Mongolia for me just struck me as that I was
*  on the travel route for two years at this point and
*  I come across people they say the plan to go here
*  next they plan to go there next what they've come
*  from Cambodia Vietnam, but no one had ever said
*  Mongolia really.
*  So I was just fascinated home to the Altai Mountains
*  the Gobi Desert go your reindeer tribal community
*  of North you got the Eagle Hunters in the West your
*  camels down south of the Gobi just like this country
*  is fascinating and from that point on I was just
*  like I wonder if you're hundred miles.
*  Let's walk maybe 200 as I heck why not go for the
*  length when I start to look for people who had
*  done it before it wasn't for any record.
*  It was just for the fascination.
*  That's when I realized I can't find any evidence
*  to suggest that anyone had completed the solo and
*  support walk that I did find the guy who previously
*  attempted and he was a nice guy responded.
*  I asked him what the dangers are big list the
*  gray wolves the drunken monomaniac drifters this
*  stagnant water could dry well they can sometimes
*  be a problem.
*  Yeah, drunk.
*  I've got on the whole world and the big the big
*  Mongolians wrestling their sport.
*  So that's stocky is in the history as well as in
*  it with Chinggis Chinggis Khan as we know him.
*  Yeah, you know, but the other day can they could
*  be begin issue and he just sent this huge list.
*  I was like, yeah, maybe I look for a different
*  country.
*  Maybe I'll walk across a European country or
*  something.
*  It's a while.
*  I didn't know much about it to listen to Dan
*  Carlin's hardcore history piece on Genghis Khan.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it was like I think it's five episodes and
*  it's insane.
*  You just realize like how do I not know all this
*  like how many people they killed the Mongols
*  killed everybody half the world or half the world
*  and they would rock up in the dead of winter rock
*  up at Russia's border and they wouldn't they just
*  slit the jugular of their horse.
*  Yeah, and drink some of the blood and mix it.
*  I would heal.
*  Yeah, they would they would use that to stay alive.
*  Yeah, they apparently killed so many people that
*  they altered the carbon footprint of human beings
*  on Earth during King.
*  It's cons lifetime.
*  I think that during his lifetime, they killed 10%
*  of the population of the planet cheese.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  It's like they as many as they don't know the
*  real number.
*  They think is the low number.
*  I think they were saying like 50 million the high
*  number was over a hundred million people were
*  killed by Genghis Khan during his lifetime by his
*  mom.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he fucked so much.
*  Yeah, he fucked so much.
*  He left so much DNA out there.
*  One in five some crazy percentage of people have
*  Genghis Khan's DNA to this day.
*  That's insane.
*  Isn't it?
*  That's man.
*  Not terrifying.
*  It's not true that it went away.
*  It's like you had this military genius that came
*  along at the right time, you know with they had
*  just massive skill with archery and bows and arrows
*  and catapults and just strategy.
*  They were just really good at figuring out how to
*  take over cities.
*  They invented the bulletproof vest as well.
*  Didn't they?
*  Did they invent that?
*  Yeah, they realized that the biggest concern to
*  his soldiers to losing soldiers it was from the
*  arrow.
*  The arrow kept taking his men out.
*  So he want he came up with an idea.
*  How can we possibly chain mail or something?
*  Yeah, and it was the hair chain mail straight over
*  the vest.
*  I thought they had had that before maybe I don't
*  know.
*  And it's the show.
*  I was shocked to see the I went to like a museum
*  and there was the you know, the Schwartz sticker,
*  the Nazi symbol.
*  Yeah, Okinawa had that as well.
*  So did India.
*  Yeah, it was a different thing.
*  It goes way back.
*  A few years ago.
*  I thought it was it.
*  Hitler just ruined a cool design.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  This is what happened.
*  Yeah, Hitler ruined a cool design.
*  I mean you can never bring that back.
*  Oh, hey man.
*  I'm just really into Okinawan karate because I
*  went to a martial arts supply store in the 90s.
*  Yeah, and they had swastika and I was like what in
*  the fuck is this?
*  And then apparently it was just a part of Okinawa
*  and Okinawa karate.
*  That symbol was a very common symbol.
*  Pre-World War II.
*  Well, nobody knew what it was.
*  I mean it was a different thing.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  The 1200s it was, wasn't it?
*  The Chinggis dynasty.
*  There's a place I think it's in West Hills.
*  There's an Indian temple and this Indian temple is
*  covered with swastikas and they had to explain
*  that the construction of the temple and the designs
*  on it predate the Nazi adoption of this symbol.
*  Yeah, it was I mean imagine look look what Hitler
*  did to that fucking mustache.
*  You know, that's no one can have that mustache.
*  No, all the people in the world.
*  It's crazy.
*  He ruined a mustache.
*  Like not to say that anybody should have it but
*  there's I don't remember ever a time where someone
*  was such a piece of shit that they ruined a hairstyle.
*  Like you can never.
*  So many years on it, isn't it?
*  I mean think of I mean, there's no other mustache.
*  That's not no other hairstyle.
*  No other no just his facial thing.
*  He just ruined the whole thing.
*  But this see you find that Indian temple.
*  I think it's in West Hills.
*  I think that's pretty sure.
*  How long?
*  It's a big one in Chino Hills.
*  Where's Chino Hills?
*  Does it look like this?
*  No, no, that's beautiful.
*  Fuck.
*  How's that?
*  No, this one doesn't look that cool.
*  Maybe let me see.
*  That's a Hindu temple.
*  Nope, that's different too.
*  I don't I think it's an Indian temple.
*  I don't necessarily think it's Hindu.
*  I think it's an Indian.
*  And it's just got the signs all over.
*  That's why I searched it originally in this little.
*  God, that's so pretty.
*  Anyway, it is anyway the use of the swastika for whatever
*  reason.
*  The Nazis just decided to look cool.
*  Yeah fucked everything up.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, he probably did he take inspiration as well from
*  black Chinggis Khan.
*  That's why I used it.
*  Maybe it almost off the world and he wanted to go in that
*  direction.
*  Really?
*  I think that's what someone told me.
*  I didn't know it would make sense as well.
*  Wouldn't it would he was trying to do exactly what?
*  Yeah, I guess it's kind of did but it's interesting that
*  there are these people in history and sort of shift,
*  you know of the civilization in a certain way where they
*  just become incredibly dominant and conquer every year.
*  There's a few of these people throughout history.
*  They pop up and then everything changes because of them.
*  That's it.
*  And he's a big one.
*  Massive.
*  You're in this area knowing the kind of history that's
*  involved in this place.
*  Like what did it feel like knowing like how many battles
*  took place on that land?
*  Yeah, you can and fairly recently right?
*  I mean relatively early years the 1200s.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and you can see how the fields are massive and
*  actually going back to that guy who ran after you know,
*  on his horseback who came to deliver me the bottle of
*  tea.
*  Yes.
*  Imagine that in the thousands the noise it would make like
*  I could see him.
*  He was a dot in the distance took about 10 maybe 15
*  minutes to get to me.
*  Imagine a whole line of them soldiers, you know,
*  warriors, chingas, empire running toward the noise.
*  Oh, you'd be terrified wouldn't you?
*  This mass land as well.
*  The step just goes on just rolling fields of grass forever,
*  right?
*  Yeah, I'd see a girl in the distance.
*  It would be like a little dot in the distance and wake
*  up in the morning and I'd know it's going to take me a
*  full day to get there.
*  I've asked us comforts of my effectively, you know,
*  take me a whole difficult day just to get there.
*  Is that too?
*  You're a ballsy man to take that on that is a that is a
*  courageous journey and one of many that you've done.
*  It's got to be a weird feeling to be walking around
*  regular people that have never experienced all the
*  crazy shit.
*  The like if you're around privileged people that are
*  like really kind of soft and civilized and do you do
*  you almost want to take them with you like, hey,
*  this will help you.
*  Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  And I think for the younger generation, it's great.
*  Isn't it?
*  I'd love to.
*  Yeah, and it's also the mental health side the mindset,
*  you know, take someone out there to Mongolia or the
*  jungles of Madagascar or towards the source of the
*  Yangtze and I know you just appreciate it.
*  You have more faith in humanity.
*  You think what a beautiful world we live in.
*  They do things like that with troubled kids.
*  My friend, my friend Dan Doty used to do it.
*  He would they would take kids that were all fucked up
*  and all sorts of problems in school.
*  Yeah, and he would take them camping just reconnect
*  them to nature.
*  Take them up there for like a long period of time months
*  at a time.
*  Yeah, they'd live off the land.
*  They would fish and they would live in tents and you
*  know, come back with a reset mindset.
*  Yeah, yeah, start appreciating the little things like
*  the kettle of the toaster.
*  I told you about, you know, you know that old expression.
*  You can't really appreciate the sun unless you've
*  experienced the rain.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  It's an old expression, but it really it seems to be
*  true.
*  You know who had that?
*  I think Dylan Danis had that on his fucking Instagram
*  post today.
*  Oh, yeah, really when he was sparring with Conor
*  McGregor, obviously meaning Conor's raining on him.
*  Yeah, yeah, but that's beefed up, hasn't he?
*  McGregor, yeah.
*  Well, Conor's fighting this weekend.
*  Who do you reckon has got it?
*  I had to ask you that.
*  Yeah, because right there you can't appreciate the sun
*  if you never stood in the rain.
*  So true.
*  So true.
*  Yeah, ancient saying that is a hundred percent accurate.
*  Yeah, he's fighting Cironi, isn't he?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, he is.
*  Yeah, a couple days.
*  So yeah, today is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
*  Friday, Saturday.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Who do you think?
*  I do not know my friend.
*  No, I never predict fights because I think
*  it might feel disrespectful if we were alone.
*  I would tell you my thoughts.
*  No, but not in this one.
*  In this one.
*  I feel like this is a legitimate 50-50 proposition.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, same.
*  I don't know.
*  He's a warrior.
*  Both warriors could go either way.
*  Well, also skill wise.
*  Yeah, I look at a bunch of different things.
*  I look at damage, age, skill, motivation, and then like past
*  results, all these things.
*  So when you look at all those things, you give Connor a slight
*  advantage with stand-up, like with his speed.
*  He's very explosive and he tends to knock guys out like...
*  That left hand, isn't it?
*  Yeah, the left hand is a pistol.
*  So explosive.
*  He tends to catch guys with a lot of explosive punches.
*  He's very fast.
*  Whereas cowboy is more of a steady pace, wears on you,
*  but can also finish head kicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Has the most finishes in UFC history, most submissions.
*  I believe he has the most submissions.
*  He's got a lot of records, doesn't he?
*  A lot of records.
*  A lot of records against, you know, he's fought nothing
*  but tough guys, like for a long fucking time.
*  He's been head kicking and strangling tough guys.
*  How old is he now as well?
*  Cowboy, I think is 36.
*  36, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And Connor, I think is 31.
*  Is he, yeah.
*  Is that right?
*  Does it say?
*  I think 31 makes sense.
*  Connor has less miles on him for sure, but Cowboy's never
*  looked better than he's had over the last few years.
*  And you give him a fight where he can really get up.
*  And this is a fight where it's like a really, I mean, this
*  is the red panties night, you know, Connor always talks
*  about red panties night.
*  This is it.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's going to tune into that fight.
*  Majorly.
*  It's a giant fight.
*  It's a giant, and it's also an interesting fight because
*  even though both guys are not title holders, it's still
*  a five round fight that has the same super fight feel
*  that any other world title fight would have.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to see that fight.
*  It does, the world title, I've been arguing this forever,
*  is very important.
*  It's always good to know.
*  Kamaru Usman is the best 170 pounds fighter in the world.
*  And it's proven because he has the world title and he beat
*  Woodley and then he beat Colby.
*  I agree that that's important, but I also agree that that's
*  not required for a great fight.
*  What's required is a great matchup.
*  And this is a great matchup.
*  This to me is a pay-per-view matchup.
*  Like, I mean, I am.
*  That could genuinely go either way as well.
*  I can't.
*  And I'm working the event, but if I wasn't working the event,
*  I'd be like, what is happening here?
*  Yeah.
*  How's that go down?
*  Yeah.
*  How's that go down?
*  You know, I don't know how it goes down.
*  It might be Connor tries to catch him real quick with a
*  straight left.
*  It might be cowboy takes him down.
*  It might be cowboy tries to kick his legs in the outside.
*  It might, you know, it might be, you know, Connor takes a
*  slower approach because he thinks that cowboy strategy is
*  for him to wear himself out in the first round.
*  So maybe Connor fights light and easy in the first round.
*  Maybe he looks to prove a point, you know, who the fuck
*  is going to be the winner?
*  I mean, I think he's going to be a winner in the long run
*  just in case.
*  Well, not just that.
*  Because he has gone, he's gone heavier as he bulked up more.
*  So at third, fourth, fifth round, it's going to be
*  struggling endurance wise.
*  It could be.
*  He could also, I don't think so.
*  I don't think he's bulked up as much as he's not cutting weight.
*  Right.
*  I mean, starving himself to like 145, 155 is more
*  comfortable for him.
*  175 is no weight cutting.
*  So I think he's probably going to be walking around just a
*  little bit over that.
*  I know Donald is.
*  Donald, I think Donald in a video said he was walking
*  nothing.
*  That's nothing.
*  That's a day in the sauna and dawns on weight.
*  Yeah.
*  And then cowboy just rehydrates and he's good to go and he's
*  done it a hundred times.
*  He's oh, yeah, he's well, he's better.
*  I think he's better physically like without the drain, you
*  know, I think size wise he's better as a 55er because those
*  big giant guys like Darren till at 170 are just a little
*  bit too much, a little bit too powerful.
*  Right.
*  But I think that at 170 with Connor at 170, they're both
*  guys who are 55 pounders.
*  They're just not cutting weight.
*  Got you.
*  So there's no, I don't think there's an advantage for either
*  one of them.
*  I think it's great.
*  And I think I would love to see that trend where guys just
*  fight at their natural weight.
*  Go.
*  Yeah, because I think it's terrible for your kidneys.
*  It's terrible for your system.
*  You know, you know as much as anybody did it involuntarily.
*  Yeah, I mean that's basically when you're dying like that
*  and you're dehydrated.
*  That's how those guys are the day of the weigh-in and then
*  they have to have a goddamn cage fight 24 hours later.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's it.
*  It's crazy.
*  All the way back on everything's forgotten about then.
*  Yeah, maybe 30, 40, maybe 35 hours later at the most, right?
*  Because they're weighing in the morning and then there's
*  probably another 12 or so.
*  I mean shit.
*  It's not that much.
*  And that's after the fight.
*  Can they just go straight back to like hydrating?
*  No.
*  As much as they want.
*  Or have they got to be broken into that gently?
*  Yeah, you got to bring it into it gently.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to do it carefully depending upon how much you lost,
*  of course, but some guys, there's some guys that were
*  enormous and they would, they would go through radical
*  weight cuts.
*  Right.
*  And then for them, it was very important that they didn't
*  shock their system and some guys did shock their system
*  and then they had to pull out of fights.
*  Their body was like, fuck, and what are you doing?
*  There's an overfeeding thing that can happen to you when
*  you just eat too much and your body doesn't know what the
*  fuck to do.
*  Right.
*  It goes into a state of shock.
*  Yeah.
*  When you've been starving yourself for so long.
*  It's hard, you know, and I think-
*  They start storing the fat after, I found like after the
*  expeditions, if I went really skinny and started eating a
*  lot, I'd put on loads of weight super fast.
*  Your body's probably like this asshole might get starved again.
*  It's still in the fat.
*  Yeah, because it thinks you're going to do it again.
*  Body's amazing.
*  It thinks you're crazy.
*  Your body, well, that's the thing they think about knockouts
*  too.
*  Like when fighters get knocked out, it's easier for them to
*  get knocked out afterwards.
*  Yeah, really.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not just about damage.
*  It's about the body recognizing what's going on and trying to
*  prevent further damage by shutting itself off.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, because it thinks you're going to just take the
*  punishment and it's, it's easy.
*  It thinks it's easy.
*  If it just shuts off, it'll be better.
*  Yeah, your body just goes, fuck this.
*  Check, please.
*  Shuts itself down.
*  Old fighters, you know, they lose their ability to take a
*  shot.
*  Got you.
*  So I would imagine that was the same with all the methods of
*  the body.
*  Like if you dehydrate yourself, it's probably easier for your
*  body to go into kidney shock later.
*  Yeah.
*  Your body's like, hey asshole, you gotta stop doing this.
*  You put me through.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  It's probably harder for you.
*  Like when you think about these things, do you worry that
*  you've done these gigantic ones in Mongolia and Madagascar
*  right now in China?
*  Do you worry that you're going to have to outdo the China one
*  because the China one was a whole fucking year.
*  Man.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, you're ridiculous.
*  Really isn't it?
*  Do you worry that?
*  Okay.
*  Now I'm going to walk across the whole world.
*  Like if I said that to you, no, no, I'm, you know, the
*  business is taken off, but there's a lot that you've got
*  the expeditions, but then you've got the books, the
*  promotions, the brand endorsements, everything, as you
*  know, the tours that go on on the outside of that.
*  So you don't feel obligated to try to kill yourself.
*  No, I want to get them.
*  I want to get them shorter.
*  Definitely shorter.
*  Shorter trips.
*  352 days is ridiculous.
*  But people are not going to want that man.
*  You already fucked up.
*  You came.
*  It's like if you meet a girl and she's your favorite girl
*  ever and you're like, oh my God, she's the one and you
*  show up at her house with a dozen roses and then you don't
*  have a dozen roses the next day.
*  She's like this motherfucker doesn't even appreciate me.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  I think if we can make it just as extreme, just as ambitious,
*  even more so interactive.
*  I loved the interactivity man.
*  That's cool.
*  Do it with a good on.
*  So I pointed it with WWF in China.
*  So I want to work with them again.
*  Okay.
*  That's not wrestling.
*  You're not talking about wrestling.
*  No, no.
*  I say it.
*  World Wildlife Fund.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  Yeah.
*  How the fuck did they use WWF when WWF was wrestling for so
*  long?
*  Yeah, they did sue them didn't they?
*  I think WWF, World Wildlife Fund had to.
*  They won.
*  So who World Wildlife Fund won?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's why it became WWE.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  I thought it was.
*  I heard that only recently.
*  I was like, whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that it was because they had to admit that they
*  were scripted.
*  So they called it entertainment rather than Federation
*  World Wrestling Entertainment.
*  I think there was conflict with the World Wildlife Fund.
*  Isn't it?
*  Yeah.
*  That's interesting.
*  No, makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  So they were first.
*  They were before Pro Wrestling.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe even if they were after I think that just the power is
*  global.
*  Isn't it?
*  World Wildlife Fund.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  All over all over.
*  So potentially just because the sheer size of them, you know,
*  what excites you when you start thinking about your options
*  for potential future trips?
*  Do you have anything that like seems like really bonkers that
*  excites you?
*  What about walking all the way across Africa?
*  Yeah, you know, something that has always fascinated.
*  I'm not ruling it out.
*  It's always potentially an option, but I've always been
*  drawn to the Congo.
*  Do you always been drawn to the Congo?
*  And I was actually Justin talked to my friend.
*  Just yeah, hook us up.
*  Yeah.
*  No, for sure.
*  Because he's he's currently got a new parasite that they don't
*  they don't.
*  Yeah.
*  He's had it for more than seven and I think more than eight
*  months.
*  Yeah.
*  And they don't know what it is.
*  They are.
*  Yeah.
*  They think he might even be the first person that they've ever
*  diagnosed with it because he caught it so deep in the Congo
*  and a lot of these people that are catching parasites and
*  you know, and could be an evolving parasite to the Congos
*  of others also was there.
*  There's also vibrant crazy ecosystem of all kinds of
*  different things.
*  So what's he suffering with?
*  What's his?
*  Yeah, he's got all kinds of problems.
*  He's on all sorts of anti
*  anti-parasitic medication, but he's he was saying that after
*  he worked out he had to get into the shower because he was
*  shivering had to turn on the hot water like his yeah, he
*  looked pale and he was shivering.
*  Terrifying.
*  I think it might be in his brain.
*  They don't they don't know what's going on.
*  That's even worse.
*  Isn't it?
*  The fact that they don't know what's going on.
*  They don't know how to help him and he's got brilliant doctors
*  have been working with them for months.
*  They're trying to run the running these batteries of tests.
*  They're trying to figure he detailed it on the show.
*  And he's such a nice guy.
*  He's like one of the most selfless people I've ever met.
*  Yeah, while he's talking about it.
*  He wants to start praising the doctor and tell me I should
*  get the doctor on the podcast.
*  I'm like, let's say he's just get to the point.
*  What's going on with you, man?
*  I'm like, tell us what he's like even in describing his own
*  life-threatening illness.
*  He's trying to promote people and help him out.
*  Amazing.
*  That's the last the way forward.
*  Isn't it?
*  That's the way for it.
*  I can't man.
*  I mean, yeah, he's got it.
*  It's a wonderful story.
*  I don't know if you ever heard it, but it's I don't use
*  that word wonderful that often.
*  But with him I do.
*  It's like he was bullied.
*  He was bullied when he was a kid.
*  Yeah.
*  And then got into fighting and then became depressed and was
*  a UFC top heavyweight and left.
*  He won.
*  He was not.
*  He didn't win the ultimate fighter, but he was one of the
*  top guys in the ultimate fighter and then he left the UFC
*  and just started to do all this work in the Congo and started
*  to build wells to the Pygmies and then decided to come back
*  to fighting just to sort of raise awareness for the Congo
*  and to start this foundation.
*  Yeah.
*  So he starts this fight for the Forgotten Foundation starts
*  his fighting career off again.
*  He comes to the top heavyweights for Bellator catches
*  malaria three times three times and keeps going back and
*  forth to the Congo to spend these long trips out there.
*  But in the process, he's gotten really sick.
*  The last one he doesn't know what he looks great still, but
*  he's still fucking with him.
*  What?
*  Yeah, what now was he?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, they've just got to find what it is.
*  You got to figure out what it is cure and hoping that these
*  anti parasitic medications are putting them on to have an
*  effect on whatever it is.
*  Yeah, maybe it goes away.
*  I don't know man.
*  They the worry for me is when someone says they might it
*  might have gotten into his brain and like what is that?
*  I mean, what is that?
*  What happens then when something's in your fucking brain?
*  Like what's going on in there?
*  Terrifying.
*  Yeah.
*  How do we see where have you seen the disease?
*  Yes.
*  Was it with the worm?
*  Yes.
*  Behind the eyeballs.
*  Yeah, I should see it.
*  Yeah, we played that on the podcast.
*  We played the video of it.
*  Yeah.
*  It was frogs, right?
*  And people too.
*  Can't people get it?
*  People can get it too.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, then you're going to go in there.
*  I was that not so much anymore.
*  You've just put me off, but no, this was, I was planning
*  to walk.
*  I was looking into walking the Congo before the Yanksy.
*  The Yanksy made more sense.
*  But now after that, I'm like, no, no, if I'm going to the
*  Congo, it wouldn't be the duration of hiking a river that
*  would take probably over the years shorter, so much more
*  dangerous, you know, got everything there.
*  So maybe we'll just stick to a two week holiday in the Congo
*  and plan my journeys elsewhere.
*  If you go to the Congo, you got to go walk through the
*  stretch that has that giant chimp living in it.
*  Do you know that about that giant chimp?
*  What is it?
*  What's his name?
*  The Bondo ape.
*  The Bondo.
*  Yeah, it's a larger version of the chimpanzee.
*  It's like six feet tall, huge 200 plus pound chimps.
*  Geez.
*  The locals call them lion killers.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, they nest on the ground.
*  We got an image of them.
*  They nest on the ground like gorillas.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this one is not that this is an image of the dead ones.
*  See if you can go to, there's, if you just Google Bondo ape,
*  there's some really good, see that one in the upper left
*  hand corner, Jamie.
*  Yeah, but that picture I don't think is real.
*  I want to say that's fake.
*  Congo's giant Bondo ape.
*  See that one's real.
*  That one's real.
*  Those people with the dead one.
*  Okay, good.
*  Make that larger, please.
*  Can you just make the, yeah, you go.
*  That is, that's the first evidence of one that they ever
*  found and then they shot this thing and they took pictures
*  of it, but I believe that was in the 1930s.
*  And then they got another one that they shot at an airport
*  and these guys are posing with this thing.
*  See, see if you can find the one that's it at the bottom,
*  the very bottom, that right there.
*  Bang.
*  Look at that.
*  Go, go full screen.
*  The one below it.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  Make that larger.
*  Look at the size of that fucking chimp.
*  So that is this thing that they call the Bondo ape and it has
*  a crest on its skull like a gorilla.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not like it's not skull is not shaped like a chimpanzee
*  skull.
*  And so go back to the picture, please.
*  That's okay.
*  That's big enough.
*  But because it is not a very clear picture anyway.
*  So these guys shot this at an airport and look at the hog
*  on them too.
*  But the size of that thing, I mean, look at the men behind
*  it.
*  I don't know how big they are, but let's assume they're
*  tiny and they're five foot five.
*  That thing is five, ten, five, eleven, probably well north
*  or 200 pounds.
*  It's a champ.
*  Oh my God, a reputed piece.
*  Yeah, easy.
*  But the cool thing is this is a weird subspecies that's
*  only in this.
*  I think it's called Beely in the Congo and they call it
*  they either call it the Beely ape or they call it the
*  Bondo ape.
*  But it's an enormous.
*  Sure.
*  I've stopped picture there where the guys are either side
*  holding it up.
*  I'm sure I've seen that so Google Bondo ape camera trap
*  photo.
*  There's a camera trap photo of one of them walking upright
*  and it's about six feet tall upper left hand corner.
*  That one.
*  Six feet.
*  Yeah, they said by measuring the stuff around it.
*  They think that that is a six foot tall chimpanzee walking
*  through the fucking jungle.
*  And that's this guy.
*  There's a guy named Carl Amman.
*  He's a I think he's from Switzerland.
*  He's a wildlife photographer and he spent a considerable
*  amount of time trying to find these things and take photos
*  of them because of all the descriptions that the natives
*  have these enormous chimpanzees.
*  They got video of one of them eating a jaguar.
*  They don't know if it killed it or if it found it dead,
*  but so local sports at the world.
*  Hey, whereabouts in the Congo is that you know in Beely?
*  Yeah, I think it's called BILI.
*  It's not a large place, but it's incredibly dense jungle.
*  It's very hard to get to but for a long time.
*  It was just legend.
*  But now they have actual video of them.
*  They have photograph.
*  They have scat samples DNA and then they have the skulls
*  the skulls that are not quite gorilla and not quite
*  chimpanzee.
*  Got you.
*  When they first got I'm pretty sure they thought it was a
*  hybrid.
*  They thought like a gorilla fucked a champ, but come here
*  bro.
*  And then now they think it's a totally different subspecies
*  of chimpanzee.
*  So there it is.
*  They go yeah Billy you leave forest.
*  So that's where you got to go bro.
*  Yeah, that's not far from the it's at the sort of that
*  looks like the source there.
*  Yeah, is that what Congo could you go through there?
*  So that area looks small, but it's probably bigger than
*  Florida.
*  The area where these things I mean the Congo's so big.
*  It's just always fast from a young age to hear all sorts
*  of stories about the Congo.
*  Don't you?
*  Isn't it wider than the contiguous United States?
*  I think the Congo itself is wider than the United States.
*  I think there's more landmass in the Congo.
*  There's an amazing BBC documentary on the Congo from
*  many years ago from yeah, I think it was like from the
*  90s, but they spent a 29 times the United States is
*  29 times bigger than the Congo.
*  Okay.
*  Hold on.
*  Stop stop.
*  242,000 square kilometers, but the width of it.
*  I think it's the width.
*  Only 5 million people living there for the size of it.
*  Oh, that's it.
*  Okay.
*  No, it's not.
*  Okay.
*  It's not as wide.
*  It's not even as close to Texas or something.
*  Yeah, it's like it's bigger than Texas for sure.
*  It's like Texas and California and maybe like one other
*  state smushed in there.
*  It looks like it's like 30% of the United States still a
*  lot of wilderness that though.
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  And if there's a fucking giant champ living in there.
*  Yeah, all kinds of other shit.
*  Oh, all sorts all sorts.
*  Have you seen that a shoe bill bird that lives there?
*  No.
*  Oh my god.
*  It's a five foot tall dinosaur of a bird with an enormous
*  face.
*  His face is like this big and it looks like like it doesn't
*  look real like you see it.
*  I think I see a with the way that you described it.
*  Maybe photos videos.
*  Oh the face that they have there.
*  There's some great high-resolution photos of the
*  shoe bill.
*  Will you look at them in the eye and you're like what the
*  fuck is that?
*  Is that real?
*  They look like the most ferocious looking bird.
*  It looked like that right there.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on, bro.
*  Face.
*  Imagine walking through the jungle.
*  See you're not looking down at you.
*  Yes, or walking through the jungle and you part some leaves
*  and that fucking thing is staring at your face.
*  Oh my god.
*  We came across, you know, aviator elephant birds.
*  I think David Attenborough.
*  Elephant birds elephant birds.
*  I think David Attenborough first.
*  Discovered it all went to Madagascar because he was
*  fascinated by the elephant bird went extinct.
*  I don't know how long ago but their eggs were about the
*  about what's half a foot like a football.
*  Yeah, almost like a yeah rugby ball football.
*  Yeah in size.
*  Oh, there we go.
*  Oh my god.
*  Yeah, that egg.
*  I'd be painful.
*  That's so big.
*  Look at the size of that fucker.
*  They go look at that comparison with an ostrich.
*  Oh my god on the let there you go.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy fuck.
*  And these were big but I came across the elephant bird
*  eggshells.
*  They're about this thick as well.
*  Maybe quarter half a centimeter in thick in thickness
*  and they're just scattered across the southern beaches
*  of Madagascar in the thousands.
*  So this thing is still alive.
*  No, this is going extinct.
*  It's just the eggs are still there.
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  There's David Attenborough.
*  I think you bought one back in Cardiff, which is the
*  capital city.
*  Is that many of them you can just go get one this file.
*  Yeah, just crushed because they're so thick.
*  Oh, look at that compared to just last forever.
*  Holy shit.
*  They're huge.
*  Get how many years ago they went extinct shows couple of
*  thousand.
*  How many of these things have been captured or collected?
*  I'm not too sure.
*  Don't know how many why the elephant bird disappear.
*  What does it say human people?
*  What?
*  Yeah, I believe it was the humans.
*  Isn't it?
*  Hunts roll down to humans may not be to blame.
*  Oh god damn pop-ups get us every time.
*  Wow.
*  I meant that's huge though, isn't it?
*  Yeah, but do you ever see the ones they had in North
*  America the terror birds?
*  No.
*  Oh fuck.
*  They had seven feet tall murderous carnivorous birds
*  that couldn't fly running around North America.
*  Geez.
*  Yeah, pull up terror birds.
*  Jamie's he's searching overtime in this episode.
*  I'm just trying to scare you with all the shit you've seen
*  your whole life.
*  These were enormous birds.
*  There's one that shows the look at the size of that
*  thing.
*  There's one that shows the really go to back to that
*  National Geographic thing that you just had right
*  there Jamie in the middle.
*  Yeah, I think that was like a CGI documentary that
*  they had done on one.
*  This verse wolves.
*  I don't even want to click.
*  Well, I think there's so much bigger than the wolves.
*  They probably hunted him down.
*  There's a size comparison there isn't there?
*  See next to a human.
*  Yes, there it's a far left.
*  You know, it's crazy chasing horses and shit.
*  Imagine my exploration back there.
*  Oh, the whole different ball game when it oh, you had
*  no idea.
*  So small excited but dangerous as well, you know,
*  well, we're talking about people that believe in
*  witches and people that believe in witchcraft like
*  back then you almost had to have some belief system
*  to keep you going because you had no idea.
*  Yeah, what was around the next corner?
*  So these terror birds were alive.
*  I believe when human beings are alive, right?
*  When did these things when were these things alive?
*  If I had a guess, I'm going to guess they died out
*  million years ago.
*  Half a million years ago.
*  62 to 1.8 million years ago.
*  Whoa, 62 million to 1.8 million.
*  The temporal range covers from 62 to 1.8 million
*  years ago.
*  So I think that's 62 million that 62 years ago.
*  Okay, so no people.
*  Yeah, so definitely no dinosaur dinosaur age.
*  Cenozoic era.
*  Cenozoic.
*  So we just some kind of monkey chimp type thing was
*  all we had back then.
*  I mean, you know, I think like that was like Australia
*  Pythagoras or something like that.
*  What year was that?
*  Okay, you got I'm over googling you.
*  Still stuff living living with us though, isn't that
*  that's terrifying.
*  You did the camel spider.
*  Yes, well, it injects you with like an anesthetic.
*  Yeah, like stories of soldiers waking up half an ear
*  missing because they've been being injected in the
*  middle of the night by this big ass camel spider size
*  dinner plate, isn't it?
*  What is this chain mammals of the Mice have seen
*  which are I guess the same the same era.
*  So it looks like giant sloth time period that North
*  American bear time period.
*  Look how small the horses are.
*  Holy shit compared to those giant sloth things.
*  Avatar is that's a short face bear.
*  That's what that is.
*  That's that enormous bear.
*  You've seen that thing, right?
*  The short face bear short-faced bear.
*  Have I seen it?
*  No, bro.
*  Short face bear was the most terrifying bear in all
*  of history.
*  Short face bear was way bigger than a polar bear and
*  super carnivorous and they think it might have been
*  the thing that kept human beings from successfully
*  navigating the trek through the Bering landmass until
*  they went extinct.
*  They're huge.
*  There's there's a picture of a guy standing next to
*  a recreation of a short face bear and it's so big.
*  They think people probably hunting them off to
*  extinction or they don't they don't really really
*  know do you get an image of a short face bear?
*  That's ridiculous animal.
*  I didn't even know existed until a few years ago.
*  Oh, that's probably so much.
*  That's why that's sapien.
*  I don't know if it goes into the details.
*  Yeah, sapien.
*  Does it go into the details of this?
*  Go with the one in the far right corner.
*  Oh, yeah, look at that.
*  Yeah, that's what it looks like.
*  Oh man.
*  You just would not venture outside.
*  Fucking imagine how big that is.
*  That's a brute, isn't it?
*  It's like a cartoon comic book version of a bear.
*  Like you can't believe we're looking at this thing
*  where literally this thing is standing up.
*  These gentlemen, let's just assume they're somewhere
*  in the neighborhood of six feet tall.
*  This thing is their entire height plus a couple of feet.
*  So double their entire height.
*  I should say plus a couple of feet.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Like their head this thing standing up and their
*  their heads are like right around where his hip bone
*  is although he is on a little bit of a mound.
*  I'm counting that.
*  It's pretty close to 14 15 feet maybe standing outside legs.
*  Yeah, but why they have him on a mound.
*  Listen bitch, we know he's tall but put him on.
*  You're exaggerating.
*  You're making it look more ridiculous.
*  It's ridiculous as it is without putting him being on a mound.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you have him?
*  You trying to make it even crazier.
*  It's crazy enough but super predatory.
*  Sure-faced bear.
*  Yeah, between that and saber-toothed tigers.
*  There was an African lion that used to live here.
*  Look at that fucking monster.
*  We were just the bone of the food chain, weren't we?
*  Once upon a time.
*  As soon as we invented the fire wasn't it?
*  As soon as we discovered the fire, boom.
*  Change from there.
*  Control of fire probably helped, weapons, flint.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  I wonder what came first.
*  We were just after scraps, weren't we?
*  Leftovers from lions.
*  Do you feel when you're doing these treks and you're going on
*  these these journeys and you're walking through places
*  like Mongolia that are incredibly wild.
*  Do you do you try to like envision what it must have been
*  like to be an early person without all these amazing
*  resources that you have at your disposal to help you get
*  to this area that you're going to?
*  Yeah, it would be a whole different kit and everything.
*  Like so in Mongolia, didn't he actually even use that GPS
*  because that failed me.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, all communities were in different places.
*  It just didn't work.
*  I went back to Bogstand.
*  It's map and compass.
*  Can you imagine even before then as well?
*  Map and compass.
*  Yeah.
*  A fold-up map?
*  Yeah, a fold-up map.
*  Let's get out.
*  Yeah.
*  We use Google Earth?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Again, Bogstand did low budget journey that the Mongolia
*  one was.
*  So, so if you lost your map, you'd be fucked.
*  Yeah, that but also the track that I was on.
*  As I said, you could be following goat track or camel
*  track and that is your lifeline.
*  That leads you to the next water source.
*  So if you're in a desert storm, for example, it'd make
*  more sense to try to keep going.
*  Well, no, just try to camp down, hide under your shelter
*  if you lose sight of the track.
*  But if you don't, you can keep going.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you did walk at night as well, a lot of people
*  say, well, it's hot during the day and you're suffering
*  with dehydration.
*  Why didn't you walk at nighttime and you've got the
*  ammo pit vipers, snakes.
*  You stand on the back end of them because you don't
*  see it.
*  You're pretty screwed, but you've also got the tracks.
*  You need to be able to see in the distance the tracks
*  splitting off because you'll come across almost like
*  a junction four to five different tracks that's
*  splitting off.
*  That's when you need your map and compass to be like,
*  which one, which track should I go down?
*  You know, terrifying.
*  Oh my God.
*  I can't even imagine.
*  And you can't communicate if you come across, if
*  you're lucky to come across locals as well.
*  That just put you in the wrong direction.
*  They'll normally point you in their community, which
*  is down south up north and you're trying to go east
*  and try and say, no, I want to go that way.
*  No, no, no.
*  Next communities this way.
*  So I don't want the next community.
*  I want to walk to the most Eastern, you know, so
*  it gets difficult.
*  But yeah, that was always a threat.
*  The dehydration in Mongolia really terrified me.
*  Now what happens if a stand storm covers the
*  track up?
*  Yeah, back to your map and compass and just hoping
*  that you can be aware of the people around you.
*  Hoping you've got enough water.
*  Hoping you make it to another community or settlement.
*  Whereas the jungle, harsh environment, you know,
*  spiders wise, snake wise, etc.
*  But same time, you've always got water.
*  You can hack in the bamboo and it just leaks out
*  water, you know, you always got food.
*  Does anybody know where you are?
*  Yeah, I had a tracking device and specially for
*  Mission Yanksy because it was Guinness World
*  Record.
*  We set off a tracker and every five minutes it
*  come up with my speed.
*  So even if I jumped in a car or on a bicycle,
*  boom, every five minutes, it's my speed.
*  It's my altitude, my longitude, latitude,
*  coordinates, distance covered, whether I'm active
*  and you'll zoom in and you can see my current
*  location within five meters.
*  And that was part of the interactivity.
*  So I wanted to make this expedition as interactive
*  as possible for the full year of like sharing
*  blogs, videos, live streams, photos, getting
*  people to join.
*  Again, presenting in schools, getting the kids
*  out litter picking along the Yanksy River, doing
*  the filming for the documentary, which was
*  securing international documentary.
*  The Mission Yanksy will go out as so that's
*  exciting.
*  So all of this was very, very well planned, very
*  in terms of the interactivity.
*  It's like six months of survival, six months of
*  interacting with all the locals and just sharing
*  it, getting out there as best as we possibly
*  could.
*  So I was heavily on the radar with GPS systems
*  that trackers the lot.
*  Wow.
*  Well, listen, man, you got an infectious sort of
*  way of talking about this.
*  It makes me almost want to do something like
*  this.
*  Come join me.
*  No way.
*  But it does make me appreciate what you've done
*  in a unique way because I can see how it's
*  affected you.
*  It's like and what we were saying earlier about
*  things being when you when you do something
*  incredibly difficult like that, it sort of like
*  enhances you as a person enhances your view of
*  the world.
*  You have you have just more things you've seen
*  than the like how old do you?
*  29.
*  Yeah.
*  For the average 29 year old person, there's no
*  comparison.
*  The things that you see in the way you've
*  experienced them in a very difficult way and very
*  difficult.
*  And, you know, it's it's a very courageous way
*  to like the way you just asking people for food.
*  Like it's kind of nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  I appreciate it, man.
*  It's really cool.
*  But again, you know, normal upbringing normal
*  background.
*  So again, I can do all of these school talks
*  corporate talks and that's the main message that
*  I want to portray is there's no financial
*  background.
*  There's no even university degree, no military
*  background sort of just working through hard
*  work, you know,
*  and if I can do it, you can do it type of
*  message, you know, is out there just got to hold
*  your vision, hold your dream, protect it.
*  It doesn't matter what else anyone says and it
*  doesn't matter if they don't see it for you.
*  What's important is if you can see it for
*  yourself.
*  Also, go for it.
*  You have to be a special person to be able to
*  do this.
*  All you knuckleheads out there.
*  The thing that I'm going to go walk across
*  Africa now.
*  Don't you don't don't.
*  That's it.
*  No, you're experiencing people preparation.
*  Yeah.
*  And do it the way you've done it the right way.
*  That's it.
*  Listen, thank you for coming here, man.
*  I really enjoy having really really enjoy talking
*  to you.
*  It was really cool.
*  And you're like I said your story is it's very
*  very inspirational man, but it's also it's
*  exciting.
*  I like to know there's people like you out there.
*  No, that's great.
*  Now.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks very much.
*  Tell people how to follow you on Instagram.
*  Yeah, on the Instagram.
*  It's just ash underscore Dykes.
*  You got the website.
*  Ash under store Dykes.
*  Yeah, everything's ash dykes.
*  Twitter as well.
*  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
