# Joe Rogan Experience #1388 - Louie Psihoyos
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 20, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSVI6gfjs8)
*  All right, here we go. How are you? Good. Good to see you. Good to see you. How did
*  you get involved with the Cove? What was the history behind that? I might give you the
*  long version. Sure. There's a good friend of mine, Jim Clark, the guy that started Netscape,
*  Silicon Graphics, WebMD. I wanted to film. I was doing a story for Geographic back in
*  1995, I think it came out. I was on the Information Revolution, and Jim Clark was sort of the
*  Steve Jobs of my generation, right? He didn't want to be photographed. He was just too busy.
*  Then I started working for Fortune magazine, and he had built a boat, the world's tallest
*  mast I think at that point, and went over to Amsterdam to film him. We hit it off, and
*  he said, would you teach me how to be a good photographer? He made three companies from
*  scratch worth over a billion dollars, and I said, well, if you teach me how to be a
*  billionaire, I'll teach you how to be a great photographer. Then we traveled all over the
*  world taking pictures for about the next 10 years. We did mostly underwater photography.
*  He built the best underwater camera ever made by an order of magnitude. It was just a piece
*  of work, because Jim doesn't do anything half assed. Every time we would go to a dive site
*  and come back to it, you see this shifting baseline where there's less fish, there's
*  less coral. In fact, he took me to a place in Papua New Guinea, he said, Louie, I'm going
*  to take you to the best place I've ever seen. It's in Papua New Guinea. We flew over there
*  all day to get there, a day and a half to sail. We dive on the GPS coordinates, and
*  it's rubble. It's completely gone. This would happen not all the time, but a lot. We don't
*  know what the insults were. It could have been dynamite fishing, it could have been
*  anything. Who knows what it was. I think it was the third time that we were in the Galapagos.
*  Jim turned to me and said something like, somebody should do something about this. We
*  saw a fisherman illegally fishing in a marine sanctuary. Sort of empowered by the success
*  that he's had in business and seeing how he could change the world and his businesses,
*  I said, how about you and I? He said, what do you mean? I said, we'll use your money
*  in my eye and we'll make films. I'm jumping careers at this stage. I'm going from being
*  a fairly successful still photographer, really busy, to a career where I had really no business
*  doing it. I'd never really made a film before, not even really a short film. I'm nervous.
*  I'm feeling sort of full of myself, like I'm going to start this great career. We're down
*  the Caribbean on a boat and my kid starts with Jim on vacation with our families and
*  my kid starts playing on the beach with another kid. It happens to be Steven Spielberg's kid.
*  So Steven comes over onto the boat to meet Jim and he made Jurassic Park using Jim's
*  computers, you know, silicon graphics. After I had Steven alone for a few seconds, I said,
*  do you have any advice for a first time filmmaker? He said, yeah, never make a movie involving
*  boats or animals. Oh, great. Of course, the first film we did was The Cove. But at least
*  you don't have actors and special effects and boats and animals. It's just a part of
*  the story. It's not like you're like with him, I think what he's meaning like jaws.
*  Exactly. Yeah, because you have to match shots and all that. But it has its own set of trying
*  to keep the horizon level on a boat. You don't want to give the audience seasickness. But
*  I would add to that, don't do a movie where people want to kill you because when we did
*  The Cove, it was exciting but dangerous work. Yes. Yeah. Look, that movie changed a lot
*  of people's minds and opened up a lot of people's eyes to the horrors of the way dolphins are
*  slaughtered. We were just talking about this before the podcast. I think they are as intelligent
*  as human beings. I just think the difference is they can't change their environment. They
*  don't affect their environment the way we do. They don't build houses. They don't have
*  cars. They don't send emails. So we don't appreciate what they are. But when we look
*  at the complexity of their brains, the fact that their cerebral cortex is 40% larger than
*  a human being, they have this incredibly complex language that we don't even really totally
*  understand. We can peck out. Don't understand any of it. Yeah. I mean, we can peck out patterns.
*  I mean, the scientists have... I mean, I'm sure you're aware of John Lilly's work. Sure.
*  John Lilly, I mean, for years and did it in really weird, unconventional ways. He tried
*  to take acid and communicate with dolphins. It's one of the reasons why he created the
*  sensory deprivation tank. We actually have one of those over here. Right. And Lilly,
*  they were forever trying to figure out some way to figure out some method of communication
*  where they were trying to get the dolphins to talk like people and we would try to make
*  their noises and to no avail. Yeah. I mean, they're obviously extremely complex animals.
*  If you judge them by our value, like people say, oh, they didn't invent the car and use
*  computers. But intelligence can be seen as your ability to live, exist in your environment.
*  By that standard, put us in the water and have a go at it and see how we do. They don't need
*  anything in that world. They travel through three-dimensional space. I mean, it's incredible
*  what they can do. Yeah. Well, it's not just dolphins do it. I mean, look at butterflies,
*  monarch butterflies. It takes three generations for them to go to migrate from Canada down to a
*  six-hectare area in Northern Mexico. And they do that. Somehow they find it every year. I
*  couldn't find a studio without an iPhone. Right. We don't even have a clue on how most the world
*  works. And the second film I worked on, The Racing Extinction, that's about whether we're
*  going through a mass extinction right now. We're exterminating this stuff, these animals,
*  before we have a chance to even know how they operate, the ecosystem, how it even works. The
*  friend of mine said it's like, we're burning down the Library of Congress before we have a chance to
*  know what the books read. Yeah. Well, that's what they did with the Library of Alexandria. That's
*  why we don't really totally understand how they built the pyramids. But what disturbs me is this
*  egocentric approach that we have towards marine life in particular, because of the most intelligent
*  versions of life that we know of other than ourselves, that we for some reason universally
*  have accepted up until really recently because of your film and because of Blackfish and more
*  awareness and Sea Shepherd and these different organizations that are trying to let people know.
*  Like, you got to pay attention to what this is because I think history, I think when all said
*  and done, we're going to look at this as some insane slaughter of what's basically like water
*  people. They're like some form of super intelligent life that some cultures have just decided or just
*  competitors in the fishing market. Yeah. Well, I can't agree with you more. I mean, I think that's,
*  and I think that was the shock of the cove that you see our counterparts in the ocean being treated
*  like that. And I think when you look at the way we made that film, it was, we pretty much told the
*  story was going on in the oceans by looking at that cove. And William Blake said to see the world in a
*  grain of sand, but we could look at, in that film we talk about overfishing and listen, the reason
*  that they shouldn't be eaten besides that they're sentient and intelligent is also that they're
*  toxic. Their meat is now, their flesh is now some of the most toxic waste in the world when you bury
*  them. You know, there's, I think 6,000 times more PCBs than, you know, than the background in the
*  ocean. There's, you know, all the flesh that's been tested in Japan in the last 20 years has between
*  five and 5,000 times more mercury than allowed by Japanese law if it was a fish, but it's a mammal,
*  of course. So I tell you- It's insane. Just hearing that is insane. I tell you an interesting story.
*  When we were making that film, there was a point where we went down to the IWC, the International
*  Whaling Commission meeting down in Chile, and we were trying to get an interview with some of the
*  top people there that run the organization because, you know, whales, dolphins, they're killing
*  them en masse. And we had the footage at that point, and we were just hoping to get an interview
*  with somebody that worked for the International Whaling Commission. And I think it was going from
*  Houston to Santiago. The plane was full. I couldn't even sit next to, you know, my partners and my
*  buddies and the film crew. There was one empty seat next to me, and, you know, they were waiting
*  for somebody else to come from another flight. And right before the plane door closes, in comes
*  Akira Nakamai. He's the head of overseas fishing for Japan, the head bull goose Looney, and he sits
*  down right next to me. I'm looking at my buddies, you know, on the plane, thinking, my God, if there
*  is a God, you know, he has a good sense of humor. So he sits down next to me, and I didn't want, you
*  know, him to, like, find out who I was and then move. So I waited till dinner was served, like,
*  an hour or two later. And I said, do you have any idea who I am? He said, no. I said, I know who you
*  are. I want to show you a film. Yeah. So we had a condensed version of it, you know, probably about
*  12 or 15 minutes of it at that point, and I showed it to him. And I said, how do you reconcile killing
*  these sentient, intelligent animals when you know that their flesh is poisoned, you know? And there's
*  recommendations for pregnant women to eat this, you know, this flesh, you know, on the Japanese
*  Ministry of Health site. And he said, I'm not in charge of food safety. I'm in charge of food
*  security. In other words, he doesn't have to worry about the health consequences. His job is just to
*  provide enough meat on the plate for the Japanese people. And it gives you an insight of how he's
*  thinking. You know, he's in charge of, I think there's 145 million people in Japan in an area
*  about the size of our California. And he says, 17% of the land area in Japan is only, you know,
*  good enough for growing crops on or living on. We have to, you know, turn to the sea for food.
*  And at that point, they were also caught skimming, stealing about 200,000 tons of endangered bluefin
*  tuna. This is over about a 20 year period. Now, when you start talking about big numbers like that,
*  I can't imagine, you know, it's hard to imagine it. But imagine like, how are they stealing this tuna?
*  Well, they're, they have quotas, and they're exceeding their quotas every year, which means
*  that they're taken away from other countries. So it's not just like, everybody, every country has
*  their allotment. And once you've reached it, you're supposed to go home. But the Japanese kept on
*  getting more so that the Australians actually caught them. You know, they figured out over
*  this 20 year period that they went through the books and saw what they reported and was actually
*  sold at the Tsukiji market, found out they skimmed 200,000 tons. That's five big train cars, like
*  trains full of, you know, endangered tuna. Like not cars, but the whole trains, like 110 car trains,
*  five of them full of-
*  It's weird to just reconcile the idea that tuna's endangered. You know, you think of tuna as being
*  something that you just get at the store. Like tuna, tuna's a weird one, right? Because it's such a
*  common food. It's in cans. You see it at the sushi place. You know what I'm saying? Like to hear that
*  tuna's endangered, most people are like, is tuna endangered? Like they're hearing this going, is
*  tuna endangered? But when you talk to people that work at the fish market, they'll very clearly tell
*  you that there's a radical difference between the amount of tuna that was available 30, 40 years ago
*  versus now.
*  10 years ago. I mean, we're down to bluefin tuna's particular is down to about 90s. It's down to 4%
*  of their historical levels.
*  That's incredible.
*  Yeah. And-
*  And there's no way to stop this. There's no, I mean, it seems like everyone's waiting for someone
*  else to do something. And during the meantime, everyone's just trying to make money.
*  A lot of money. Yeah. Unfortunately, it's sort of what happens with endangered species. The more
*  rare it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. And so there's very little incentive to do the
*  right thing. And, you know, but this is happening with all the fish stocks. I mean, I probably gave,
*  I run a little organization called the Oceanic Preservation Society, and I probably gave out
*  more seafood guides than anybody on the planet. This is a Monterey seafood, you know, got watches.
*  Like what fish are sustainable? And I've seen them, you know, go through the fish stocks. So less
*  and less, you know, we started at the big animals and we start to, you know, slowly go through all
*  the fish stocks until like we're, you know, like McDonald's used to do halibut. Now it's pollock,
*  which is a very small, you know, white fish from Alaska. And now that's being, you know,
*  hunted to extinction. So we're going through these fish stocks. It's, you know, that's shifting
*  baseline where you're seeing, you know, each successive generation adapts to the diminishment
*  of the previous one. That's what's going on. So I just stopped, you know, handing out seafood
*  guides and now I'm trying to sort of preempt it. So I don't think, you know, the big question is,
*  there's seven and a half billion of us on this planet, soon to be 10. Is there enough wild animals
*  to feed us all? There isn't. You know, you look at the biomass of mammals on the planet, you know,
*  between livestock and humans, we occupy 96% of the biomass of mammals on the planet. 4% are wild
*  mammals. And then, you know, so we can't all be eating wild fish. You know, we think about that,
*  you know, you never go out and say, look, let's get some land food. You say, you know, we've
*  commodified, you know, sea animals. That is interesting, right? You don't say land food.
*  That's a really good point. You know, they did at the turn of the century. I mean, during the
*  late 1800s, rather, there was market hunting in North America. A lot of the soldiers were done
*  with world with the Civil War, rather, they were hunting and they hunted all the deer, the bear,
*  the antelope, the buffalo, and they got down to like incredibly low numbers. You know, elk to this
*  day, I think are only in 10% of their original range that they were at in the 1700s. And that
*  was all from market hunting, from people just going out buying, you know, meat from these market
*  hunters that have shot these things. And they didn't really have refrigeration back then. So
*  it wasn't like they could freeze it and store it. And they got down to these incredibly low levels
*  until Teddy Roosevelt and a lot of other people that were conservation minded realized like what
*  was happening here. And they put a stop to it all and then started enacting programs to reintroduce
*  these animals to the areas where they're extirpated. And now you see historic levels of
*  especially white tailed deer, there's more white tailed deer in America now than were
*  when Columbus landed. So but that's been successful. But it's also that's a weird one too,
*  because white tailed deer are almost a farm animal, because there's so many of them that exist in Iowa
*  and Kansas and around farmlands. Like they literally exist in fields and a lot of them live off of GMO
*  crops. That's very strange. So like I have a buddy of mine, my friend Doug, Doug Duran, who has this
*  huge piece of land in Wisconsin. And he's like the deer in my area are essentially eating these GMO
*  corn, they're eating Monsanto corn. Like this is so weird. Like, yeah, they're wild. But they're also
*  kind of farm animals, you know, because they exist in record numbers, because they've got so much
*  food to eat. And no predators. Yeah, I mean, the only predators they have there, I mean, they have
*  some wolves now, very few in some some parts of the driftless area in Wisconsin, I think they have
*  they have some bears too, and coyotes, a lot of coyotes that will kill a lot of the fawns.
*  I lived in Boulder, Colorado for a while. And we had a lot of bears and mountain lions come through
*  our yard, because we're right at the base of the foothills of the Rockies. And a neighbor,
*  I woke up one morning, the neighbor was like looking at his minivan, there's a big dent in
*  the side. And he's trying to figure out like, how to get a dent because it was parked here all night.
*  And he found a an antler in the bushes. Oh, well, what the hell, how did it and then the question is,
*  how does a deer run into it? And then in the paper the next day, there was a picture of a
*  mountain lion on a house down the block, sitting on a hot tub cover, this is in the winter,
*  holding a deer with one, you know, in his mouth with one antler. Oh, so it attacked it and slammed
*  it into, oh, Jesus Christ. I lost a dog in Boulder to a mountain lion.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I had a little dog who's part American Eskimo and part Pomeranian, a mountain lion got it.
*  The mountain lion, I think, got our cat.
*  Yeah, they get everything up there, man. If it's not them, it's a fox. You know,
*  there's a lot of foxes up there to get things, but God, it's beautiful.
*  Yeah, it's gorgeous.
*  Boulder's incredible, incredible place. And you'll be driving down the road and you see,
*  it's weird, like the deer in Boulder know that they're safe. So like we were looking at this
*  house in Boulder and we opened up the door to the backyard and there was this enormous deer just
*  standing there staring at us. And my wife thought it was fake. I go, no, that's a real deer. She's
*  like, what? And then it just turns its head and starts moving around because it wasn't even
*  remotely freaked out that there were people, a stone's throw away from it. They're just so
*  used to being around people. It's weird.
*  The neighbor, I remember the neighbor of ours, planning rose bushes on the front of their
*  property and all proud. And then I remember I was driving home later on that day and there's such a
*  deer coming, just snipping the tops of the roses. It's like a salad bar.
*  Yeah. Many people have turned on deer because of the loss of their gardens,
*  the roses especially. They love roses. Yeah. It's, is there anybody that has ever come up with any
*  sort of a plan to do what they did for wild animals in North America? Because you can't
*  regulate it the way you can wild animals, because in wild animals, if they have a particular area,
*  you could make it so people can't go in that area. But the ocean is so enormous. Like how,
*  has anybody come up with some sort of a repopulation plan?
*  Sure. Sure. There's E.O. Wilson. I'm on the board of the advisory board of his group. It's called
*  the Half Life Project. You know who E.O. Wilson is?
*  No. Okay. E.O. Wilson is a Harvard professor.
*  He has two Pulitzer's for his work in biology. He's wrote the book on biodiversity. He's
*  considered the father of modern biodiversity. He's about getting right around 90 years old now.
*  But looking at, he would do things like go to an island and then pretty much exterminate everything
*  on it and then try to figure out, well, at what rate do the animals come back and what's sustainable?
*  He's figured out that to save 85% of the wild animals on the planet, you have to put aside
*  half of it for them. Half of the planet?
*  Half the planet. Yeah.
*  So the ocean, you would have to literally make half the ocean where people couldn't travel in it?
*  Not travel in it, just not exploit it.
*  No fishing. Yeah, no fishing.
*  And so Sylvia Earle is working on hotspots. They're called, I think, what she calls this,
*  it's like blue zones where you have a lot of biodiversity. Try to keep those
*  away from fishing exploitation.
*  How do they do that though? You would have to get everybody on board, right?
*  Yeah. Well, the high seas are, that's tough, right?
*  Yeah.
*  The Japanese were fishing in an international marine sanctuary for decades, so you have to,
*  this is really tough when you have organizations that really don't have any teeth to it.
*  The attitude that he has, that pragmatic attitude about feeding the population,
*  you almost can sympathize with him, right? I mean, 100 plus million people in this tiny place the
*  size of California and just pulling mostly fish out of the ocean. I mean, it's a crazy place to be
*  in terms of his position.
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't envy it at all, but what do you do?
*  You don't slaughter dolphins. That's what you do.
*  Yeah. Well, we're endangered species or, I mean, I don't know what's sustainable anymore.
*  Is it possible to, I mean, I know they've done this in some places outside of Hawaii,
*  where they've bred animals, fish rather, like sushi fish, like hamachi, and they've had these
*  pens set up, and then a lot of times a storm will come by, like a huge storm, and they break these
*  pens, and then those fish get wild, then people start catching them.
*  Yeah. Well, that's, I mean, like salmon, like, well, you know, I went, they were trying to,
*  in Japan, when we were doing the cove, we went to a university where they were breeding the first
*  bluefin tuna. These are from eggs, you know, so this is what they do at some places where they
*  catch them, then they put them in these pens, then they fatten them up. These were, they're
*  making bluefin from scratch, basically, from eggs, and really hard to do, really skittish.
*  And when I went there, they were shoveling, this is back when I ate fish,
*  um, they were shoveling these mackerels, like what I would feed my family with, like a family of four,
*  they were shoveling it to the tuna. And I said, hold on a minute, like, how many, how many, how
*  much, you know, mackerel does it take to make a pound of tuna? They said, oh, about seven,
*  up until about 150 pounds, and after that it takes 14 pounds. So seven pounds of wild fish to make one
*  pound of farm raised fish. I mean, this is like going to the bank and, you know, you know, because
*  you want a crisp $5 bill and say, you know, give me a, you know, here's a couple, a couple 20s.
*  Wow.
*  But that's, you know, if you look at, you know, what are they feeding, you know, a lot of these
*  fish, they're feeding them, you know, parts of farm animals, fish, wild fish. And I was just
*  reading this morning, Los Angeles Magazine that, um, and the cover says, you know, fish, fish are
*  fucked. And it has a, and it talks about like the fish that are raised. And I don't know the data
*  behind it, but they're, they have eight times more pollutants in it than wild fish. I don't know if
*  it's what they're feeding or maybe because they're sitting in a, they're stationary. I think that's
*  big part of the problem. Yeah. Yeah. And apparently they don't taste as well. But when we were in
*  Hawaii recently, um, we went scuba diving and, uh, you know, snorkeling. So you jump off the boat and
*  you're swimming around and you know, what's really fucking weird about that is how few fish
*  there are. Like when you're under there, you're like, you expect you're going to dunk your head
*  underwater with those goggles on. You're going to see all this wildlife, all these fish swimming
*  around us. No, it's not much. Yeah. You don't see much. Yeah. There was a, about, uh, 10 years ago,
*  I was down in the Caribbean, a friend was getting married and I took his daughter out to, you know,
*  I didn't know it at the time, but it was her first time snorkeling.
*  And we were in an area that I'd been to about 20 years before and there was nothing. There was
*  nothing there. It was just like a desert. Yeah. And then I heard her screaming through a snorkel
*  and I thought, well, what's wrong? And she was screaming cause she saw a single orange tang.
*  That was the only life form we saw there where I used to see clouds of schools of these, you know,
*  orange and blue tang. Now there was nothing. And I thought, my God, she thinks that that's beautiful.
*  And it is. It's just, you know, the single fish. But, you know, again, a shifting baseline,
*  the generation before when I was there, it was probably looked like the land before time.
*  These places I went to with, with Clark, you know, Raja Ampat, where you'd see, you know,
*  if you go to the Caribbean, you might see 30 fish on a different species of fish in a dive
*  and Raja Ampat, you'd see 300. And it was just miraculous. And when you're taking pictures,
*  you actually see more detail with the picture than you can with your, your, your eye can't
*  comprehend it all. So it's only when you get back and you see these reefs that we've, you know,
*  we lit like jewel boxes, you see how much life that there is there. But there was just
*  unbelievable, stunning amounts of wildlife, but that's going on all over the world.
*  And the Great Barrier Reef, you know, we lost over half the Great Barrier Reef in the last two years.
*  It was never that good anyway, you know, 15 years ago, you know, after being to these,
*  some of the best preserved places in the world that I've been to with Clark, we looked at the
*  Great Barrier Reef and we'd be like, oh my God, this is not that great. And now they've already,
*  then they've lost half again. So, I mean, if you're just putting your head in the water for the first
*  time and you come from, you know, Iowa or Wisconsin or Boulder, that looks pretty good. But if you knew
*  what came before that, you're, you're seeing this, this, you know, assault against, you know, nature
*  going on. What is taking out the Great Barrier Reef? It's, uh, we're heating the planet, we're heating
*  the water. It's bleaching. So there's a couple things. There's multiple insults. You have runoff
*  from fertilizer and pesticides from agriculture. You have the heating of the water, these events.
*  When I say it, it's dying, it's dying. It's not like, oh, it's going to come back. Once the coral's
*  dead, that's it. It's not going to come back. Does sunscreen play a part in that as well?
*  Probably not there. It's pretty, it's fairly remote, like in Hawaii it would or the Caribbean.
*  But it's pretty remote. You have to get out several miles to the Great Barrier Reef. And it's,
*  if the further north you go, the more, more isolated it is. And we went the entire length
*  of the Great Barrier Reef and it didn't look, it got slightly better as you got north, but there's
*  only a couple boats there. It's not like you have, you know, thousands and hundreds of thousands of
*  tourists out on the beach. And the other thing is acidification. The burning of fossil fuels
*  is acidifying the oceans is now about 30% more acidic than it was, you know, 50 years ago.
*  And when you make, you know, there's more carbonic acid in the water, it makes it harder for the
*  corals to survive. And it's basically, you have these multiple insults going on at the same time.
*  It's probably not just one thing, but there was a massive bleaching event two years in a row,
*  Great Barrier Reef. And so it's disappearing in our lifetime. That's, you know, but if you look at,
*  we have a, we have a, the last coral barrier reef in America is down in Florida. And they have
*  like semi-treated sewage coming out of these outfalls that Lakey can swim through these,
*  you know, I've been out there, you know, on these beaches, you could literally talk to somebody on
*  the beach or scream to them on the beach and they have this green water coming out of sewer pipes,
*  200 meters away, 300 meters away. And so they're dumping semi-treated sewage on the last reef in
*  America. This is going on all around the world. And I know what we do, I don't know, but we,
*  this is the last generation that we have that can actually do something about it,
*  because we're seeing it disappear in our watch. And that's what I'm trying to do is try to,
*  not just create the awareness that something's going on, that we have to do something, but
*  try to create action.
*  Pete Slauson Now, when you say semi-treated sewage, what do you mean by that?
*  Pete Slauson Well, that's what they reported. So, it smells like sewage, it smells like crap.
*  But if you go to the website, it says it's just semi-treated. I don't know, they're not,
*  you know, putting it through the aerators, they're not going through the whole system,
*  but it smells like shit to me, you know. You come out of the water and it's like, you know,
*  we all stink.
*  Pete Slauson You smell like shit.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, this is, by the way, this is on the Hollywood,
*  Fort Lauderdale border. This is not like –
*  Pete Slauson How is that legal? I mean, this is not a third world country. How is the United
*  States allowing them to pump semi-treated sewage?
*  Pete Slauson It's a very good question, you know. There's so many things to work on. I know
*  the activists down there working on this, they're just trying to get people to see it,
*  to know that this is going on. And if, you know, I think they close the beaches down when,
*  you know, when the wind shifts and then it starts to push it on shore.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Pete Slauson If you saw, if you were on the beach and you saw what was going on there,
*  you wouldn't be sending your kids there. You wouldn't be going to Florida if you knew what
*  was going on on that beach.
*  Pete Slauson We can make arguments about whether or not you should go to Florida all day long and
*  I'm with you 100%. But I just can't imagine that they would allow this. And that, I mean,
*  how much more would it cost to treat it versus semi-treat it? How much more would it cost
*  Pete Slauson I only have an answer to that question.
*  Pete Slauson to not do what they're doing?
*  Pete Slauson It's a good question.
*  Pete Slauson It's fucking insane. And then that they close the beach when the water shifts
*  and the wind shifts and heads towards the shore?
*  Pete Slauson And people get sick and they probably don't even know it.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I mean, you know, we'd be out when we're at one outfall. That's what they call
*  them an outfall is basically a sewer pipe. You know, nothing's happening and all of a sudden,
*  you can start to hear this rumble and then you see this green.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, God!
*  Pete Slauson And we're not talking like a little drain pipe too. Like, literally,
*  you could swim through it, not stand in it, but it's big, like four feet, five feet tall.
*  Now, why, I mean, why are they allowing? I mean, does anybody have an argument for why that's money?
*  Pete Slauson Money.
*  Pete Slauson Money.
*  Pete Slauson Because it costs money to treat sewage.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ, though. That's insane.
*  Pete Slauson Well, there's a lot of things like that going on right now.
*  Pete Slauson But it seems like someone should be held accountable for that. Like, whatever
*  cost benefit that they've decided is worth polluting the ocean by pumping sewage into it.
*  Pete Slauson Well, you know, that's a good question. We did,
*  now that I recall, this is like five years ago, we tried to get an interview with the key people
*  down there, but try to, like, if you're going to talk to somebody about this, nobody wants to go
*  on record to talk about it because it's really bad for tourism. And it's not good for the political.
*  Pete Slauson Is there a video of it? Can we show video?
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You got something?
*  Pete Slauson Well, this is –
*  Pete Slauson Jamie's got something here.
*  Pete Slauson I need to see this.
*  Pete Slauson It's in Racing Extinction.
*  Pete Slauson The second film I did.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, look at this. Look at that.
*  Pete Slauson There we go.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, that's so disgusting.
*  Pete Slauson Four months ago, maybe.
*  Pete Slauson Wow! It is just a gigantic pipe pumping green shit into the ocean. Why is it green,
*  by the way? Pete Slauson
*  Wow. It's a good question. It could be the color under the water, too.
*  Pete Slauson You said it was green when you saw it as well, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Well, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That's it's treated.
*  Pete Slauson It's much better that way.
*  Pete Slauson Well, everything in the spectrum down there is a little bit blue or green.
*  Pete Slauson It's probably food coloring.
*  Pete Slauson Look at that.
*  Pete Slauson Fuck. What is that, fish?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, fish love it.
*  Pete Slauson Chewing on the sewage.
*  Pete Slauson They can eat crab.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Christ.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. And then the fishermen, fish on it too when the
*  outfalls go. Pete Slauson
*  Jesus Christ. To catch fish that are eating shit. Look at that. That is insane.
*  Pete Slauson We're looking at this pipe and it looks like
*  a cloud of poison is being jettisoned out of this pipe and into the ocean.
*  Pete Slauson The important part is if you came up, you would see people on the beach.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, God.
*  Pete Slauson I mean, we're not talking about like, you know,
*  miles out at sea. We're talking about –
*  Pete Slauson How in America? I mean, I know Florida is barely America,
*  but how in America is that possible?
*  Pete Slauson That's a really good question. We try to,
*  you know, we try to explore some of these issues, but trying to get somebody to talk on the record
*  about this is really difficult.
*  Pete Slauson Is there any other part of the country that
*  has something like that?
*  Pete Slauson Not that I know of.
*  Pete Slauson Fucking Florida. Jesus Christ. I mean, of course it's Florida. I mean, is there
*  a place that is so worthy of all the stereotypes like Florida is? It seems like every time you
*  think you've had enough. Look at all these fish just swimming into the shit.
*  Jared Slauson That surface looks like it's boiling when
*  all the water comes out.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, God. Shit boiling. Shit boiling Florida.
*  Look at the ground. It's all just covered with algae.
*  Pete Slauson Well, that's kind of the point. Like, what I'm saying is like, you know,
*  we always think somebody else should be doing something about this. And, you know, that's why
*  we do films. It's not just to create the awareness and, you know, to try to get something done about
*  it. When we, you know, when we did The Cove, they were killing about 23,000 dolphins and porpoises
*  every year for human consumption. And I think the last time, I think 2017 was the last reports of
*  how many they killed. I think it was 1,610 total souls, like a 93% drop since we did that film.
*  Because every time that Rick O'Berry, he's the guy that captured and trained the five female
*  dolphins that collectively played the part of Flipper. Every time that we talked in the
*  Japanese press, we try to use the word mercury because that's their Achilles heel. You know,
*  if you talk to the Japanese, the people from the IWC, of course, they're out of that now,
*  they've quit the IWC. They'd say, well, what about cows, pigs and chickens? You know,
*  they're pretty sensual and intelligent too. And we say, well, but the mercury.
*  Jared Slauson Now, how many people are eating dolphin meat?
*  Pete Slauson Less. You know, I think less because of the film. When we were there, they were
*  feeding it to school kids. And the school children, it's the young mind, like infants or
*  you know, prenatal that has the most deleterious effects of mercury, you know, because your
*  neurons are just developing. And they had hatched a scheme to have it for school lunch programs all
*  over America. And in Japan, unlike in America, you have to eat everything on your plate. So,
*  it's almost like you were force fed to poison. Because of the film, that stopped. So,
*  I mean, films can be really powerful, you know, to –
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's amazing. The film is so disturbing, man.
*  Pete Slauson Well, you know, it is. And you know,
*  when Mark Monroe, the writer, he came up with the name the Cove, I said, it sounds like a horror
*  film. He goes, well, it is.
*  I mean, look, if we write, and these are water people, I mean, essentially, as intelligent,
*  if not more. I mean, you were saying that the complexity of their brains is –
*  Pete Slauson They have more, you know, more density for neurons, like the folds of the
*  brains. If you look at, if you did a slice of a brain, it looks like a fjord, right? And there's
*  more convolutions with a dolphin. There's more surface area for neurons. And of course, those
*  more neurons you have, the more connections you're making. And they actually have – oh,
*  God, there's spindle neurons that they have for developing complex emotions. You know,
*  if you look at orcas, you know, they're really tight-knit communities. A male orca won't,
*  you know, will spend most of its life not more than a body length away from its mother the entire
*  time until it goes away to do what it does. These animals are really social and they're
*  communicating at levels that, like you said, we don't even know what they're saying.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Like, the average person can hear from, you know, 50 hertz to 20,000 kilohertz,
*  and they can hear, I think they can communicate up to 200,000. So, there's a whole band worth,
*  like an order of magnitude more bandwidth that they're actually communicating with. And we hear
*  like a little squeak like, but if you slow it down and break it down, there's actually, you know,
*  there's more patterns in there than we can sense. What's interesting about whales, blue whales,
*  blue whales are really solitary creatures. They're, you know, they're not gregarious like dolphins,
*  they don't usually hang out in big, you know, groups. But down in the Southern Ocean,
*  it was confounding people, like how do they find the krill bloom that happens in a different area,
*  you know, hundreds or thousands of miles apart? How do they, you know, they all find it? And
*  one of the researchers, Roger Payne, came up with this idea, and it was through the work with the
*  Navy that there's something called the deep ocean channel. And it's basically between the surface of
*  the water and the thermal layer that's, it fluctuates depending on where you are at in the
*  column, let's say 500 feet. They basically use their voice, which is one of the loudest voices
*  in the animal kingdom. It's so loud, but it's infrasound, you can't hear it. And they'll use
*  it. It almost gets propagated like the internet.
*  Through that layer.
*  That, so it's bouncing up and imagine that it's bouncing up to the surface and down to this cold
*  layer, and it can go for literally thousands of miles. And that is so they, it's called
*  reciprocal altruism is the theory is that they, when one finds it, they start singing and that
*  notifies the rest of the group that this is where the krill bloom is, and then they can all survive.
*  Holy shit.
*  There's a friend of mine, Chris Clark, Dr. Chris Clark from over in Cornell University. He was,
*  he was, there's a string of pearl hydrophones that the Navy uses called SOSIS in the Mid-Atlantic
*  Ridge. And it was designed to listen for Russian submarines back in the Cold War. But they opened
*  it up to some researchers and Chris was one of the first ones to, you know, if you're a researcher
*  listening to whales, you go out in your little boat and you drop a hydrophone in and you can
*  usually think, oh, that's amazing. Look, you can hear sounds everywhere. There's, you know,
*  everything is basically singing down there from crackling shrimp up to blue whales.
*  And, you know, so you have this impression that, man, I just, you know, dropped in on this,
*  this conversation. I don't know what's being said, but like that's, that's, it feels pretty special.
*  Now he goes to SOSIS and they have like a, back then it was like a, like an underground bunker full
*  of like people with three screens back before anybody had three screens and everybody's listening
*  to, you know, for the, for submarines. And he can, he sees that on a board is lit up in the whole
*  world. He's seeing wherever the blue whales are singing or the, you know, all these whales,
*  it's lit up like a Christmas tree. And they're trying to, what the Navy was trying to do is to
*  filter through the voices of what they call the biologicals to pinpoint the submarines.
*  But he was like, Oh my God, this is like the Holy grail for listening to, to whales because they
*  have, they can tell what's going on, on an ocean ecosystem level. When he could just, you know,
*  you imagine one guy on a boat out there trying to listen. Now he can all of a sudden has all
*  this incredible data and he could track animals, these animals like blue whales, they'll ping
*  and they can basically send out a wave and they can see thousands of miles away, you know, with,
*  with their, with their other extra senses. Wow. Jesus. That's incredible.
*  And we just, I just imagine that ability to, to pick up all those extra patterns that we don't
*  even hear. So we don't even understand exactly what kind of data they're getting from each other.
*  And we don't know what it means either. So we, we just know there's something, right?
*  Yeah, there's a friend of mine. I don't even know if you want to talk to his name's
*  Salvateli. He's, he's working with this, another friend of his, Aza, to try to use AI to figure
*  out what animals are saying. I know he's, he's talked about it before, so I think it's with the
*  press. So I think it's okay if I mention it, but I've been sending them to people like Roger Payne
*  and Chris Clark, these other researchers I know, because they have these huge databases and he's
*  trying to use AI to see if they can figure out, you know, using computers, what these animals are
*  saying. And I think that's the Holy grail for getting us, for letting us care about these animals.
*  If we can, if we know what they're saying, I think that changes the game. Yes. I mean, Roger Payne,
*  you know, when it's in the code, but when, you know, he's the guy that, well, he and his wife
*  found out that these animals are determined that these, the animals, like humpback whales are
*  singing, you know, these strange, beautiful sounds. I don't know, do you want Jamie pull up like,
*  like songs of the humpback whale? Yeah, we'll find something to play.
*  That these animals were actually singing, you know, it was actually his wife, Katie Payne,
*  that figured it out and he wrote up the paper with another guy. But-
*  Like joyously singing.
*  Yeah, like, like, you know, she, when a, when a humpback whale-
*  We have an issue with playing it?
*  Yeah, that's actually been sold. So it's a copywritten.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. A lot of times we do that, we'll get pulled off of YouTube.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, because somebody owns that, which is hilarious, right? They own the sound of nature,
*  which is like what-
*  You can probably, you know, if you go onto the website of the Cornell ornithology lab,
*  I think, I think there's probably some stuff that you could play with that's not copyrighted.
*  Excuse me.
*  I think it's so-
*  Oh, look, it's tough. It's going to be real tough though, because somebody may own it,
*  that may not know that somebody else owns it.
*  An agent for the whale.
*  They're protecting it and trying to get-
*  An agent for the whale.
*  Some CAA guy.
*  I'll take a peek, don't look.
*  Hey, we want to get paid, you fucks. Are you aware of what's going on with the resident
*  orca pod in, outside of Seattle?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, which it's a, this very strange situation where the salmon have dwindled radically.
*  And this resident pod only eat salmon. They only, what is it, Chinook?
*  Chinook.
*  So they only eat Chinook salmon. And so these, the ones that migrate, the migratory orcas are fine
*  because they eat marine mammals. They eat mostly seals. And these poor resident ones do not want
*  to eat anything other than salmon. And so they're literally starving to death and they're trying to
*  figure out ways to feed them.
*  Yeah, no, I was working on that story for the last year or so on a different aspect of it.
*  That was, I was co-directing a film. I was doing the Russia portion. There was, the Russians had
*  illegally caught 101 cetaceans. It was about 87, roughly, belugas and about 11 orcas illegally
*  for the Chinese market. I was covering that part of it.
*  Was that the Chinese market of marine shows?
*  Yeah. Yeah. There's, you know, while the, you know, the cove and blackfish in particular have
*  been really effective about shutting down, you know, in a massive way, the amount of people going
*  to the shows. But in China, they haven't got the message. So there, I think there was 25 new
*  dolphin parks opening up in China alone this year. You know, so it's, you know, it's like whack-a-mole
*  and the Russians were providing, no, that, and that story. When I was in Russia, this is like
*  one of those amazing situations. Putin on a state at the union addressed, announced that they were
*  going to release the whales back, you know, from the whale jail that were caught over in Eastern
*  Russia. So we ran over to Vladivostok and covered that portion of the story. But to answer your
*  question, there's another co-director that was working on the Northwest and the Lummi Indians were
*  going out to feed, you know, from their stock of farm-raised salmon. They were feeding the animals,
*  but that's, you can't, that's not sustainable because they're, they move around. Yeah. You can't
*  find them sometimes. But the solution seems to be to get rid of a lot of the dams. Yes. That's a
*  kind of an unpopular position with some people, but they're not efficient anymore. They're holding up,
*  you know, the whole ecosystems are being degraded because of that. Well, you know, the one of them
*  that they initially, when they set it up, they didn't even realize what they were doing. This
*  was in like the 1930s or something like that where they, you know, they had hundreds of thousands of
*  salmon just coming to this wall and not understanding what the fuck's going on and dying there.
*  There's a friend of mine, I'm a co-director in a film about plastics with Josh Murphy,
*  did a film called Artificial. And it's about just this, you know, the craziness of raising salmon
*  for fishermen to fish, you know, cause it gets really expensive when you start looking at like
*  what you think is a wild salmon, you know, what it actually cost to raise it. Sometimes it's like
*  thousands of dollars per fish, you know, because there's so few of them actually come through and
*  then, you know, get back. But what is this, Jeremy? This is pattern radio. So this is AI,
*  I'll reset the website, but it says that you can explore yourself to find humpback whale songs
*  and make your own discoveries. So say- Use AI to explore thousands of hours of humpback whale
*  songs and make your own discoveries. So they'll play some of it? Yeah, there's a lot to dig
*  through here, but it's a really cool looking site. If anybody wants to go check it out.
*  So
*  what's that heavy duty pattern over to the left, Jamie? This thing? No, the left. Oh, here. Yeah.
*  Whoa. What about those long bars right next to it?
*  Yeah. No, they're over to the right. No, no, the long ones, the long ones.
*  Like just to the right of that image. Yeah.
*  Wow. If you, if that was coming out of space, you'd be like, what? Yeah, we would be like,
*  we have to go immediately. I've often said that about Bigfoot, that we, everyone care-
*  You shut it off. People are so interested in finding Bigfoot, but if you found Bigfoot,
*  what would it be? It would be basically a big chimpanzee or something, right? Another big
*  primate. We already know about primates. They're amazing. We know about them though.
*  But if you found, if an orca wasn't real and someone said, hey, there's this thing,
*  it's as smart as people, maybe smarter. It lives in the ocean, but it breathes air and it swims
*  around these incredible pods and they have really tight communities. They communicate with each
*  other with this language that we have had our best linguists try to decipher. We have no idea what
*  the fuck they're saying. You'd be like, well, what kind of animal is that? It would be a crazy
*  mythical creature, like the creature from the Black Lagoon or the Loch Ness Monster or something. It
*  would be like some incredible thing. If you ever found one, people would be freaking out. We get so
*  used to things being real and I think we're just used to them. Unfortunately, because of things like
*  Free Willy and going to SeaWorld shows where they're doing flips for fish and everybody's
*  clapping, people have got it in their head that this is just the thing. It's a normal thing.
*  But what they are is one of the most fantastic creatures that the world has ever known. In all
*  of the billions of years of life on this planet, there's two things that are mind blowers in terms
*  of their intelligence. One of them is us. The other one is them. All the marine mammals,
*  whether it's whales, dolphins. Whales are amazing because of their size, but
*  whales, dolphins, and orcas. Obviously, orcas are cousins of whales, but those things are
*  they're some of the most spectacular creatures that the biodiversity of the Earth has ever created.
*  I agree. When you're watching a dolphin show, you're watching a spectacle of dominance.
*  You're watching slaves.
*  Yeah. Listen, this is a nice room. We have plenty of water, but if we needed food and we had to do
*  backflips for it after a couple of weeks, you and I would be doing it.
*  Exactly. Exactly. And that's what it is. Yeah.
*  We, you know, in this film I was working on, we uncovered some information at SeaWorld. And this
*  is the trainers talking to management about an animal that's not performing well. And then they
*  get the vets involved. And the vets say, have you tried caloric deprivation? Wow.
*  Wow.
*  You know, so it was actually emails. And they'll never tell you that they're starving an animal
*  to get it to do tricks, but there's emails now.
*  The vet, the vet, the doctor. Imagine that if you went to, you know, a university and like,
*  his grades are down. What should we do? Starve him. Imagine if that was your kid.
*  You dad, they don't want to give me any food because I'm doing well poorly in history. Like,
*  what? Yeah. Or, you know, to perform better with sports, I guess would be a better analogy.
*  Yeah. Jesus Christ. I mean, that's essentially what they do with the Cuban Olympic wrestling
*  program. Joel Romero, who was one of the top UFC fighters, came out of the Cuban wrestling program
*  and he said that the elite athletes get to eat three times a day, but the people that are under
*  them get to eat twice a day. Wow.
*  Yeah. And they set up this insane competition so that they're hunted, so that the elite athletes
*  are hunted by the guys coming up. They want to make sure that, you know, they only develop the
*  best of the best. You know, and his, he has this crazy Cuban accent with his broken English. He's
*  like, he turned you into a machine. That's how he talks. You know, and he's just, he's an unbelievable
*  freak athlete. And part of why he's so spectacular is because he came up through this ruthless
*  program. Wow. Yeah, it's horrible, but the results are pretty spectacular. It's, you know,
*  it's just, to me, I mean, I have a very close relationship with a guy named Phil Demers,
*  who has been involved in a decades long lawsuit with Marine land in Canada. He was a Walrus trainer.
*  And I think I know the story. Yes. And he, they, the Walrus bond with humans when they're babies.
*  And he bonded with this Walrus named Smushy. And I believe she's the only one that's alive.
*  Marine land has a horrible record of animal rights. I mean, it's, it's a, he mean the way Phil puts
*  it, he goes, it makes sea world look like paradise for, for, for dolphins and orcas.
*  And he was an orca trainer there too. And a dolphin trainer. And, you know, he worked with
*  these, these people that over there and just, I mean, horrific stories of what it's like. And to
*  see these animals just living in hell, just tortured. And then they have no chance to ever
*  find their family again. They were, they were pulled from their mother when they were a baby.
*  Now here they are, you know, 15 years old, stuck in a swimming pool, developing ulcers, their,
*  their dorsal fin collapses and atrophies. I mean, it's, it's, it's so crazy that it's still legal
*  like that after Blackfish, Sea World didn't just shut, get shut down by the government.
*  And that people didn't just boycott them en masse. Yeah. There's stock, we're gonna,
*  well, in a Ted talk I have, I showed the stock price of, one thing, I was at, at Sundance for
*  the premiere of, of Blackfish. And I went down and talked to the, you know, the people that made the
*  film afterwards. And I said, we're going to be the best thing that ever happened to you. Because at
*  that point, I think we had like 650,000 followers. And then we helped organize like, you know, getting
*  musicians to, you know, to stop performing there. And we sent a copy of Blackfish in the Cove
*  to all the, the 10 major, everybody that sat at the board of directors that backed
*  Sea World, you know, so we, you know, everybody that sat on the board got a copy of that,
*  that, that film. And then when they're, there's, I can't remember, I guess it was their earnings
*  came out that, that quarter, it just, their stock value just fell down from 32 to like 16. They lost
*  like a, you know, a billion dollars in value almost overnight. And, you know, but now it's back up,
*  it's back up in like the twenties, I think. Really? Yeah. So, you know, they're doing other
*  things too. They're, they're trying to, you know, to, you know, do rides and, you know, do what the
*  theme parks are doing and try to get away from that business. But it's still happening.
*  It should be illegal. I mean, it's, it's, it's really simple. It should be illegal. It's,
*  once you look at the data, what we understand about their intelligence, what we understand
*  about the way they've captured these things and taken them from their families and what they
*  understand the close knit, the nature of these orca pods, the fact that it's not illegal,
*  it's just, it's stunning. Yeah. Well, they've, you know, a lot of them, you know, they've bred
*  a lot of theirs now in captivity. Which is even more fucked up. Yeah. I mean, they're not even
*  from the, you know, if you know the, like how they learn and now they're suddenly thrown into these
*  disparate groups where, you know, you have some that are wild, some come from different,
*  you know, imagine these, these populations of the transients and the residents, they don't speak the
*  same language now. And then you pull the mothers away. So there's really no.
*  What do they do when they don't speak the same language? Do they try to communicate?
*  Oh, they just run into it. They, they beat up each other. There's, you know, all sorts of,
*  you know, evidence that we have, we have had people go in there and, and because there's a lawsuit
*  going on right now with, and so we've, we've gone in and photographed for the people with a lawsuit
*  and you look in there, they're, they're raked, you know, they, they, the dolphins chew on the
*  iron bars on the side or on the sides of the pool. There's a lot of their teeth are just sawed off
*  because they get infected. It's, um, yeah, it's gone to something else.
*  What can you go on to? I mean, it's one of the, I really think it's, I mean,
*  it's like a human rights issue, but it's a human rights issue for water people,
*  you know, and we just, if we could really, like you said, if we could decipher
*  what they were saying and then break it down to a very clear language.
*  Yeah, that would, that would certainly help with everything. Yeah. Um, if we knew what was being
*  said, cause you know, we, we did this film called racing extinction and the working title was called
*  the singing planet. Cause it's just about everything is singing. We just haven't been
*  listening. Everything from a, you know, from a mouse up to a blue whale has a song. I mean,
*  technically it's a song and, but we don't see it as that we're, we're, we're looking at it only
*  through our own eyes. And you know, that was part of the objective of that film was to try to get
*  people to understand like, Hey, there's all these other life forms out there. They're disappearing
*  before we have a chance to even know what they're up to. And we're the last generation that can fix
*  it. So, you know, we're, we're going through a mass extinction right now. The sixth, the, the,
*  the Anthropocene. And you know, when I started, you know, I did four stories for national geographic
*  on, on dinosaurs on the message. So like the midlife of the planet, a lot of friends of mine were,
*  were paleontologists and Michael Novichek, the head provost of the American museum of natural
*  history. I was in the Gobi desert with them. And you know, you, you go around to these beautiful
*  landscapes where you see dinosaurs laid out, you know, basically from the tip of the nose to the
*  tip of the tail. Like you don't see anywhere else in the world. Like they almost got exterminated
*  by something in one go. And he had told me that, well, we're going through a mass extinction right
*  now. And I was like, what? He said, Oh yeah, there's, you know, mankind is responsible for the,
*  the six mass extinction. That's the first time I heard about it about 15 years ago. And you know,
*  I said, what, you know, what are the issues? What are the, he said, well, the drivers are
*  habitat destruction for agriculture, pollution and basis, and basis species and overconsumption.
*  But the, but the biggest one by far is habitat destruction, the raising of,
*  of crops for animals that we in turn eat. So, you know, if you look at what's going on in Africa,
*  you know, poaching is a big, huge problem, but a bigger problem is there, you know, a lot of that
*  land now is being, and what's going on the Amazon as well. It's being torn up for getting feed for,
*  for cattle for, did they come, did they find out what was causing those fires in the Amazon? Like
*  what were those, were they set? Do they know? Yeah, those are, those are all illegal fires for
*  illegal crops for, you know, soybean corn to feed cattle.
*  So they burned down the jungle so that they could wipe everything out. This has been proven.
*  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they'll do it the same thing in Indonesia, but for palm oil.
*  And the thing about Brazil is Bolsonaro apparently has approved this kind of behavior,
*  right? Is that what's going on down there? Yeah. To prop up business.
*  Right. There was an image in the New York Times of Sao Paulo and people walking through during the
*  day and the sky was like, like it was dark out just from the, from the clouds of smoke, from the
*  burning of the Amazon, from the millions of acres. Yeah. And these are one of the most
*  biodiverse hotspots on the planet. And we're, we're burning them down for,
*  well, not only that, not just biodiverse, but so unknown there. I mean, this is where
*  a great majority of some of the greatest pharmaceutical drugs ever invented. The origins
*  have come from the rainforest. People have found various compounds and things inside the rainforest
*  that have been used for a variety of different methods. There's all sorts of bugs in there that
*  we don't understand. And look at that. There's the image. How insane is that? I mean, it's,
*  if you've never been to Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo was a huge city. I mean, it rivals like New York City.
*  It's massive. And the sky was literally black with smoke. That's the daytime. Yep. Wow. Yeah.
*  Insane. Well, have you ever experienced wildfires out here in California? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Boy,
*  I mean, that's pretty crazy. Last four or five, well, what was the last month? Do you live over
*  here? Do you live on here? I live in Sausalito. Okay. Just north of the bridge. Oh, okay. Well,
*  then you guys, the Northern California one, that one, what was that? What was the area that got hit
*  last year? Oh, the Kincaid fire. Just recently. Yeah. That was enormous. Yes. And then there was
*  the one- Paradise fire. The Paradise fire. That was the one I was thinking was the largest, I think,
*  in California history. I mean, these goddamn fires, when they happen, it's a very stunning
*  and sobering reminder of the forces of nature. And when you're in this situation like we're in
*  right now, where you have all this dry ground and all these dry leaves and one thing catches,
*  and then the wind brings it down, it's terrifying. But my point was that I've been very, very close
*  to some of these fires. We've been evacuated a few times. And when it's hitting and the sky is
*  just gray with smoke and the hills are on fire, it's a very strange, strange feeling.
*  Yeah. Climate change is real and it's happening now and it's close.
*  It's about as real as it can ever get. I mean, the people who are in denial of it at this point,
*  I mean, how much longer can you hold this opinion? And what is keeping you,
*  what is keeping you on this? It's a hoax track.
*  You know, I travel all over the world. We're the only country that doesn't get it. We might have
*  the illusion that it's half the world that doesn't get it. But over in Europe and Asia,
*  they all understand it. It's not a mystery over there. It's only here. I think it's self-interest,
*  greed. I think people are... There's also a right-wing ideology. There's something that happens.
*  There's certain opinions that people adopt. They adopt this conglomeration of opinions if you are
*  in the right or if you're in the left. And one of them in the right is to deny the impact of
*  certain environmental factors and climate change and things along those lines. And it's just...
*  It's like to join this group, you have to subscribe to a certain platform or a certain
*  system of ideas. And that's one of them. One of them is that climate change is no big deal.
*  It's just a hoax. Or people are making out... I mean, I see it on Twitter all the time,
*  where someone will point something out, like, yeah, how's that climate change working out for
*  you? Just because it's really cold in some place one day. I don't think you understand what this is.
*  That's actually part of it. Have it being extraordinarily cold and the whole thing's in chaos.
*  Like all the systems are out of whack. Yeah, no, whole ecosystems. I mean,
*  I went out to the beach this morning and I probably looked the way it did 50,000 years ago out there.
*  But you go under the water, it's a whole different story. Yeah. Well, a couple degrees warmer fucks
*  everything up. Yeah, that's all you need. That's really hard for us to understand.
*  Because some days it's 76 and the other days it's 52 and the next day it's 80. It seems normal for
*  us. There's variability. But you don't look at the overall mean. If you look at the overall mean,
*  you see that rise. Just a couple degrees of temperature could change everything.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, this is what keeps me up at night. It's like, you know, if you know this is
*  going on, what do you do about it? So that, you know, you can look at yourself when you're on your
*  deathbed and say, I did everything I could to make a difference. Well, the fish one's a huge one,
*  right? And the ocean, the pollution of the ocean is a huge one because it seems like it's nobody's,
*  right? It seems like it's everybody's, but it's nobody's. Whereas like the land,
*  if someone is doing something on the like, could you imagine that Florida, if they were just pumping
*  that shit into West Palm Beach, there's just a big tube that goes into the sky and it just sprays all
*  over West Palm Beach. People be like, what the fuck is this? And then they would have to act.
*  They'd have to say, you can't do that. But because it's getting pumped into the ocean,
*  it seems like it's okay. It's not ours. It's just the ocean. Well, it's unfortunate. I gotta go to
*  work, man. I don't have time for this. Like I'm behind on my car payments. I'm doing overtime
*  tonight. You know, most people are concerned with so many different things that they don't have time
*  to think about the massive overfishing and pollution of the ocean. Well, you know, that's
*  the trick, you know, like, like as a filmmaker, how do you make a story like that so that people
*  actually want to see it? So they don't feel like it's medicine. They don't feel like, okay, I gotta
*  go watch this. Right. Medicine. That's a good way of putting it. Yeah. And you know, the cove,
*  for instance, I mean, that was a, it feels like a thriller. It doesn't feel like a lecture on,
*  you know, what we're doing to dolphins. It's sort of a, it's set up like a mystery. The first line
*  of the film was me saying, I just want to say, we try to do the story legally. I still can't go back
*  to Japan, but you know, what happens if we go back? Um, it won't come back out. Um, I'm told that
*  there's a arrest warrants out for me, a conspiracy conspiracy to disrupt commerce, trespassing,
*  filming police disrupt commerce, all that dolphin commerce. Fuck you. Holy shit. Conspiracy to
*  disrupt commerce. How did, how do you define disrupting commerce? However they want, I guess.
*  Did you have parameters that you were supposed to operate under when you were over there and you
*  went outside of them? Yeah. They, they gave us a map. It's in the film. Um, they gave us a map and
*  they told us this is where we're not supposed to go. And, you know, as my friend Charles Hamilton
*  said, that became our template of where we needed to go. Of course. Yeah. Have you seen some of the
*  Sea Shepherd work where they've caught these Japanese, uh, scientific research boats that are
*  really just killing whales? Oh yeah. Yeah. And then they're out of the Southern ocean now. This is
*  last year. They, they announced that they were going to get out of there. No, they're only killing
*  whales around their own territorial waters. So in a way it's a big victory. You know, Paul's a good
*  friend, Paul Watson. Um, he just wrote me right, just took a couple hours before I came here. Um,
*  yeah, he wanted a, like a big projector. We did, you never saw a racing extinction. No. We did,
*  you know, to alert the world that we needed to, you know, to get on this, we, we lit up the
*  Empire State building with endangered species and, um, it was like a huge event. We had like,
*  I think 939 million media views in four days, top trending story on Facebook and Twitter for like
*  four days worldwide, just to get, you know, we did do something really strange like that. How'd you
*  do that with a projector? With 50 projectors, 50 like IMAX size projectors all mounted on the building
*  that was on like 31st street. And this is all sanctioned. We had, we spent four years, uh,
*  getting permission to do it and we finally did it. And you know, I remember it is right here.
*  Jamie's got a video of it. Oh, you got to slow that down though. Oh, well it's just what's on YouTube.
*  Oh, oh, on YouTube, they, they speed it up. How long did this last for? Oh, we did it for three
*  hours, but there's like two 10 minute shows, 15 minutes shows. Was there a crowd of people that
*  Oh my God. It was, it was like, it was like the, it was like the Easter parade on fifth Avenue.
*  What was funny is like the, the producer and the distributors said, Oh, it's gonna be too expensive.
*  Nobody will, you know, nobody will be there in the summer time in New York. Um,
*  They always say that there's fucking a hundred million people in New York. I go there in the
*  summertime. It's packed with people. If you like, there's nothing happens in the summer in New York.
*  Like, like I was doing a show down there and like, well, this is really good. I mean, it's
*  the summer in New York. How are you selling so many tickets? Like, have you looked around?
*  They have this weird attitude that nothing happens in New York in the summer.
*  Yeah. I think it's like carried over from the thirties when there was no air conditioning.
*  Yeah. So we had, uh, you know, we thought we couldn't get any more attention on that.
*  How crazy is that though? The summer in New York, everybody's out. Why wouldn't they see it?
*  Well, they said, well, the important people they said are going to be at the Hamptons or they're
*  going to be over. Oh God. Or overseas. Oh my God. The important people. Did they really say that to
*  you? They said that and they also said the press wouldn't show up because at nine 30 at night,
*  nobody could afford overtime. Oh, but you know, it looked like the Easter parade on fifth Avenue.
*  Everybody was wrong. Yeah. And then we thought, we thought, okay, that's, that's it. We can't,
*  you know, getting more attention than that. Then the Pope called and the Pope wanted us to project
*  on the Vatican during cop 21. Whoa. And then we had, I think four and a half billion media views.
*  You should have taken all of the extinct animal footage and replaced it with child abuse footage.
*  Imagine that all of the cases of all the pedophile priests of all, I mean.
*  Well, there's a lot of issues. I'm more concerned. Oh yeah, there is. I'm concerned with the,
*  I understand. I understand. One step at a time. Yeah. Yeah. That dirty place. Vatican's a strange
*  place. Like you walk around there, you go, where did you get all this money? Like, what did you
*  guys, you guys don't even sell anything. Like, you know, they have fucking billions of dollars in art
*  and spectacular architecture and everywhere you go, the spoils of riches. And you're like, what is,
*  where do you get this from? It's an amazing place to visit. Just historically, just to see what it's
*  like. And in Venice right now, if you go like the Doge Palace, if you look at the columns on that,
*  those are all different. You know, what they did is they pilfered Persia for that. And so it was,
*  you know, you had to bring it back when you were trading the 17, 1600s, you had to bring back.
*  Stuff you stole. Yeah. I was just there. I was just in Venice. And now do you know that what's
*  going on right now? They have the worst flooding they've had in 50 years. Yeah. I saw the Gritty
*  Palace. I stayed there at the Gritty Palace. Oh, that's where we were. The lobby. Like four feet
*  of water in the lobby. Really? Holy shit. Four feet of water in the fucking lobby. So what is causing
*  that? Well, it's a combination of this time of year, the tides and the storms, but also, you know,
*  seas are raising. You know, you have just a couple inches of ocean raising. You can imagine
*  there's more water out there and it gets pushed to shore. So how do you stay in the Gritty Palace
*  when the floor is water? I don't think you do stay. I think that's the least of their problems right
*  now. Wow. We had, you know, we had a, when I lived in Boulder, you know, I wasn't in the flood zone.
*  I lived at, you know, Fourth and Juniper. Like I said, right against the foothills. It wasn't,
*  you know, on a flood map, but we had a 2000 year flood and there was furniture floating,
*  you know, I had furniture floating up against the ceiling of my place. I got, you know,
*  brought out of like climate change. Look at that. Wow. That's how bad the flooding is. Yeah. That's
*  where we stayed over the summer. Yeah. It's gorgeous, but weird, but it's like, it's like a
*  really beautiful prostitute. Like, do you, do you have to do this? Cause like, look at all that shit
*  floating by. That's crazy how high the water level is. That's a restaurant. Yeah. Wow. It's
*  all underwater. Is that outside the Gritty Palace? It's around the corner. That's what it looks like.
*  Yeah. The cruise ships would pull up and then you would see the amount of people that get out and
*  then the streets would be flooded. And all the people that live there would be like, this all
*  just started happening like a decade ago, or the cruise ships were allowed to pull right up. And
*  during the week that we're there, they said they had two accidents with cruise ships,
*  like hitting docks. And we played a video of one of them. It's fucking crazy. You see this gigantic
*  boat and it's just coming in. You know, it's going to hit the dock and you know, it's going to hit
*  this boat in front of it. And everybody's running to get out of the way. And you see this like,
*  that's a mountain, some mountain that's floating, a floating mountain that has no ability maneuver
*  correctly. Look at the size of that thing. I mean, that is so much bigger than any of the buildings
*  there. And that thing's floating in and banging into the walls and look at the size of that.
*  Look at the size of that. That is so insane. And we wonder why we're screwed.
*  That thing has nine floors. That is so crazy. Look at that. Yeah. There's probably several
*  thousand people, right? Oh, for sure. For many thousand. And you know, and don't they just dump
*  their waste right into the ocean? They did in the past. I don't know if they do it now.
*  What do they do now? Put it in a baggie? Well, that's one of the things they found in LA.
*  I'm sure you're aware of this. They did a satellite overview, like an image of methane,
*  trying to find out where's the greenhouse gases, where's the biggest polluters. It turns out it was
*  landfills. Landfills, a huge issue. This idea that there is that the greenhouse gas thing,
*  the methane leak, this idea that you're going to just put it in the ground. Hey, that doesn't work.
*  It comes out of the ground. I told you we had a Tesla that we had retrofitted for racing extinction
*  that had a FLIR camera, the same camera that you use to see methane. It sees a spectrum. It's not
*  heat, but it can see methane. You can put another filter in it so you can see carbon dioxide.
*  We went around the streets of LA and we got onto the tarmac. Carbon dioxide is a little bit of the
*  boogeyman. You can't see it, but with this camera you can see it. It's pretty astounding when you
*  can just ... Right now if you put it on us, it would look like we're smoking.
*  When you show it on the streets of LA, it's like everything's disgorging.
*  There's not enough plants to absorb it.
*  Yeah, you can't absorb it that quickly.
*  That's one of the beautiful things about when you go to the woods. There's something about when
*  you're in nature and you're in the forest where you're like specifically like the Pacific Northwest,
*  which has these incredibly dense forests. The air just has a different quality to it.
*  It's just this rich oxygenated air because you're just around all these trees and plants. It has a
*  different feel to it. You just don't get here. Yeah, no. LA, I was here last week.
*  It's rough, bro. It is. It's rough. Jamie and I have been planning our escape.
*  We don't know what to do though. We're trying to figure it out somewhere. I think you can only
*  stay here a little while longer. I came here in 1994 and there was maybe 30% of the traffic
*  that there is now. I'm not exaggerating. Maybe 40%. Let's get crazy. I can come home from the
*  Comedy Store at 11 o'clock at night and be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. Just bumper to bumper.
*  I worked for the LA Times back in the 1970s and I remember at three in the morning,
*  without an accident on the road, there could be traffic backed up.
*  Backed up. Yeah, without an accident. Back then, I'm probably, I don't know,
*  how old are you? 52.
*  I got a little bit more than 10 years on you, but I remember that this valley was always,
*  for the first month I worked at the LA Times, the valley was just, you couldn't see anything.
*  And then one day it cleared up and in a rear view mirror, I was living north of town in Glendale.
*  And in the rear view mirror, I saw White Cap Mountains and I thought,
*  where the hell did they come from? Right.
*  Oh, that scared me because I thought- Yeah, you can see that from Woodland Hills,
*  from Woodland Hills on a rainy day when the rain comes in and washes it all away. Like,
*  what the fuck is this? There's mountains right there. Like, you don't see literally
*  that the pollution is so dense it hides mountains.
*  But still? Yes.
*  Okay. Well- All the time.
*  Today's a beautiful day. It's really clear.
*  Today's a beautiful day. You get lucky. What really helps us is when the wind blows.
*  When the wind blows, it clears everything out. And you can get to a high peak. There's an area
*  where trail run and you get to this really high peak and you can look out at the top and pause.
*  And some days you don't see jack shit. You just see gray. And then some days after it rains,
*  you're like, there's fucking mountains out here. I want to take a picture of this stark
*  contrast. As a matter of fact, I'm going to run not tomorrow but the next day. When I get out there,
*  I'm going to take a photo and I'm going to try to take a few photos and try to catch it when it
*  rains because it's supposed to rain sometime this week. And so get a difference between what
*  it is normally versus what it is when it rains. Because the difference is it's stunning and it's
*  all being hid by pollution and we just have gotten accustomed to it.
*  Yeah. Well, catalytic converters helped a lot.
*  Well, it also is helping a lot is this conversion to electric cars. And I really hope people
*  continue down that path, especially, I mean, they're getting better at figuring out how to
*  charge them and better at battery capacity and better, and they're better to drive.
*  We were talking about Teslas. I have that Model S. I love that thing. It's amazing. It's just an
*  amazing car. And I'm an automobile enthusiast. I love cars. You don't lose anything with that.
*  I mean, it's more fun than any other automatic car I've ever driven.
*  Yeah. I had one too for a while, but I told you I had the electric luminescent paint job.
*  You had a lot of shit going on with it.
*  Yeah. It was a nice one. But I had one of the first electric cars in Colorado back in 2007.
*  I only knew of two other ones. And I had 120 solar panels on my roof, so I didn't pay for
*  electricity. Really? Oh, roof of your house. Yeah, roof of my house. Did you see that
*  documentary, Who Killed the Electric Car? Yeah, Chris Payne. He's a good friend.
*  Very interesting, right? Yeah. And Revenge of the Electric Car.
*  It was his follow-up to it. Oh, I didn't see that.
*  Yeah, it's a good one. I think it's better than the first one, actually. But I would
*  tell my neighbors, like, hey, I don't pay for electricity. My license plate said
*  VUS, it stood for vehicle using sun. It was the opposite of an SUV.
*  And I got checks from the electric company. I didn't have bills. I had checks.
*  Because you were contributing to the grid. Yeah, so we had net metering.
*  And I thought I'd just discovered something. It was just incredible. But everybody said,
*  I was doing it just to prove that you could do it back then. And neighbors would just say,
*  but how much does it cost? And it's like, well, we should all be, you have to be,
*  people have to be early adopters before you can get it to scale. So I was an early adopter.
*  But I think even with everything that we know what's going on, that people are still saying,
*  they're not going to switch over until it's cheaper. It's a little bit better and it's cheaper.
*  And, you know, Elon, I think he's got the right idea, make it a lot better.
*  And eventually it's going to be cheaper. I mean, the Model S is a great car, but the Model 3 is
*  selling like crazy. Yeah. And it's a fantastic car as well. I mean, that Model 3 is preposterous.
*  You know, I have a Porsche 911 GT3 and it's a pretty fast car. This guy humiliated me the other
*  day. I wasn't trying to race him, but I think he was trying to prove a point. We were at a red light
*  and the light turned green and he shot ahead of me and got into the highway so fast. I was like,
*  laughing. I was like, I look, I wasn't trying to race the guy, but if I was, it would have been a
*  blood bath. You said, yeah, you keep yours on ludicrous mode all the time. Oh, mine. Yeah. My
*  Model S. Yeah, I do. I keep it on ludicrous mode, but you don't have to drive it ludicrous. That's
*  on ludicrous mode. You could drive it normal, but anytime you want to just dump on the accelerator,
*  just whoa. It literally feels like it's violating some sort of laws of physics. Like it just,
*  it does something with time. You know, like you're not supposed to be able to get there that quick
*  because you have a thing in your mind when you're driving a car. Well, if I want to get
*  in front of that car, it's going to take X amount of seconds. Even if I really accelerate,
*  it'll take some time for it and get up before I can change lanes. With that thing, it's just,
*  yeah. You just go. And people that have never been in one before, I take them for a drive in
*  the Tesla and they grip the seat and they're like, what the fuck? Everybody says the same thing.
*  Like what the, or holy shit. Those are the two things they say because it doesn't seem like
*  it should be able to do that. Like it looks like a sedan. It's like a regular car. And I talk,
*  you know, I've got like a old muscle car. I've got a couple of old cars that look fast. I'm like,
*  that car, that regular sedan looking car, five times faster than anything here. Yeah.
*  And zero emissions. But you know, we're in this transitionary period and I think the future is
*  pretty bright for that stuff. Mustang, just Ford just released a concept of this new vehicle that
*  they're releasing very soon. It's like a Mustang crossover e-car. It's beautiful. It's really cool
*  looking. It looks like a larger Mustang, like a taller Mustang, but it's all electric.
*  And Elon praised it today that Ford is going out on a limb and making something like that.
*  Oh, cool.
*  You know, and then Porsche is releasing their version. It's called a Taycan. And that's,
*  I think that's how you say it, but it's a beautiful looking, sleek looking electric car. So
*  we're moving in that direction.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's a great, Tony Sabre, the futurist, he shows a picture of the
*  the 1900 Easter parade in New York city. And it's all horses looking down from a building.
*  I don't know if you find it, Jamie, 1905 or 1900 Easter parade. And it's like, there's one car.
*  And then 13 years later, it's like, find the horse. And that these transitions, they take,
*  you know, about 10, 12 years, you know, 12 years ago, we were punching the number two key on our
*  flip phone six times to text a capital C. And I think we're, you know, we're going to be doing
*  the same thing with, you know, with the transition with food. I think it's going to be going that way.
*  Do you think that they're going to be, do you have hope for all this lab created meat?
*  What do you think about, I mean, I know there's some process that I don't totally understand,
*  where they're able to make actual biological, like bison meat.
*  Yeah.
*  Cow meat.
*  I'm doing a film series right now called Food 2.0. And I had dinner on Saturday night,
*  two nights ago with Uma, the guy that founded Memphis Meats. And, you know, I have the same
*  sort of ickiness about, you know, going that direction. But he showed me these pictures on
*  his flip, on his phone of this chicken breast that he's making. And, you know, I stopped eating meat
*  about 10 years ago, but I thought it didn't look bad. You know, it looked, he had like, it chopped,
*  you know, so that it was grilled. And I thought, you know, I have this sort of revulsion against
*  it myself because I've, you know, got myself off of it. But I looked at that and I thought, you know
*  what, that looks really edible. It looks good. You know, somebody that could eat meat, you know,
*  that would be appetizing.
*  Yeah. It seems like the science, it once, whatever it is, right, it's tissue. And whatever that tissue
*  is, it's composed of a bunch of different natural ingredients, right? Whatever, whatever creates a
*  turkey breast. It seems like it's just a matter of innovation and technology and proving to the
*  point where they could recreate that.
*  Yeah. No, the question is, you know, is that,
*  you know, is that better for you than, you know, the whole foods plant-based diet or-
*  That's the real question, right? Because that's where things get convoluted. Like, what is
*  healthy versus what is ethical versus what makes you feel like you're doing the right thing morally?
*  Yeah. You know, the way, you know, I stopped eating, you know, meat about 1986. I went to,
*  I was doing a story for Fortune magazine on the biggest independently owned cattle ranches in
*  America. And there's one that was so big in Oklahoma, they had their own slaughterhouse.
*  And they supposed to, you know, they kill the animal with this captive bolt to the brain. It's
*  supposed to happen instantly, but there was one animal that came around and it was still alive.
*  And it was at that point, it was hanging upside down and it's flesh and it's hide was stripped
*  off. And it's looking at me with its eye and it's following my eye as-
*  Its hide was stripped off and it was still alive?
*  Yeah. And it's, and it's, as it's turning around, it was turning its head and it still held my eye.
*  And I thought the son of a bitch is alive and I'm part of, part of this. So I stopped eating meat
*  shortly after that. And so I thought, well, I have to eat something, right? I have to eat an
*  animal product because, you know, you're going to shrivel up and die if you don't. And then,
*  so I became a pescatarian and that's all I ate for animal protein. Well, you know, milk and dairy,
*  but I didn't eat any thing. I limited myself to things that, that didn't walk, that didn't walk.
*  So fish was like fair territory for me. And then when we made the code, there's a scene in it
*  where we take a sample of hair from the deputy minister of fisheries there and we tested for
*  mercury. And when we were, you know, while it was out at the lab, I thought, well, I'll get mine
*  tested too. Cause I was, I get a lot of fish. I loved it. My son's still a professional fisherman
*  and I had a freezer full of fish all the time, stocked up of, you know, fresh ocean, whether
*  not fresh, but frozen ocean fish. And I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner all the time.
*  Then when, you know, we got his labs back, his sample back, it was eight times higher than was
*  high, which is like, you know, you don't want any mercury in your body. Mercury is the most toxic
*  non-radioactive element in the world. And my, my levels were 44 times higher. Jesus. Were you
*  experiencing any physical effects of that? Yes, I was having trouble with my short-term memory. I
*  had an ache in my shoulder that was there for probably decades. And I, you know, I'd try to get
*  it massaged out. And then if you start looking through the, you know, the problems with, with
*  mercury, you notice that there's, there's a whole litany of things that are causes, depending on how
*  bad you have it. But my doctor said it's the worst he'd ever seen in Colorado. So I had to get off
*  of it. And then, you know, this is, so we're here in LA for the Academy Awards and I met my first
*  vegan and I said, what do you eat? And she goes, everything else, you know, all protein originates
*  with plants. And that was how I got started. And it took, you know, I thought, okay, well,
*  mercury has a half-life in your body of about 70 to 90 days. And so it took me about two years to
*  get it down. And I thought, well, I'll just try a little bit. Two years to get it down? Why did it
*  take so long? Because it has a half-life in your body of 70 to 90 days. So 44 goes to 22. Oh, 90
*  to 180. So, okay. So I thought, okay, then I'll start eating a little bit of fish. And then I
*  jacked, you know, I had a tester right away and a jack back up and I thought, okay, I can't be
*  testing. So all fish is poison. All big fish is poison for sure. Big fish, like tuna. Yeah,
*  tuna, swordfish, marlin. So what is the recommendations? They tell you you're not
*  supposed to eat it more than a couple of times a week or something like that. But it seems like if
*  it's got a half-life of, I don't trust any of that. I mean, like, like, I mean, I can't mess with it.
*  When I was in Japan, I went to Minamata where they had the, they call it Minamata disease,
*  but it's not a disease. It's poison. This was a company that was intentionally polluting the bay
*  where there's a lot of fishermen and the kids, of course, got, well, the cats got affected first
*  because people give the fish to the cats and the cats would have had called dancing cat disease.
*  You know, you heard the expression, mad as a hatter. That's because they had the felt from
*  100 years, 150 years ago. They used to cure the felt, the beaver felt on top hats, but they would
*  use the mercury and the hatters would go mad. In Minamata, the cats got affected and the kids,
*  and then, you know, the people, a couple hundred thousand people got affected. And at least we
*  remember this is 1950s, remote villages. And an American researcher went there and saw that
*  everybody looked weird and said, something's going on here. And he found out that they were
*  dumping, you know, mercury into the bay. And I saw, I visited a doctor there that studied
*  Minamata disease. He was the guy that was in charge of figuring out compensation for what they owe
*  people. And he showed me these brains of, you know, they sliced open and it looked like Swiss
*  cheese. We're talking about the convolutions of the brain and how dolphins have more of them. Same
*  thing with people, but you know, and the ones with the slices that look like Swiss cheese with
*  those holes that it's, the mercury is eating up in the brain. And so you don't want, you know,
*  once you see that, you said you don't want that in your body. So I had to get off fish and become
*  a vegan, not by, for ethical reasons, but because of, I just couldn't eat it just for health reasons.
*  But I'm doing just fine.
*  How fucking crazy is that, that most fish is poison? Like that is, that is such a crazy thing
*  to think that the ocean is so fucked up that most of the food you pull out of the ocean is a mess.
*  Most of the fish that we're eating, I think 54% is farm raised. And what I read, but again,
*  I just read it this morning in Los Angeles magazine.
*  But that's worse, right?
*  It's worse. Yeah. And you know, the ecological damage it's doing is crazy. The health consequences
*  is crazy. So the question is then what do we eat?
*  And about mollusks. So one of the things that someone told me that was actually someone who
*  was a vegan told me about mollusks. They said, you can make an ethical argument that mollusks
*  are actually less complicated life forms than even plants. They don't have the same nerve endings.
*  They don't really move. They open and shut. And they're a viable form of animal protein
*  that is just so primitive. I heard that too.
*  Yeah. They're just not like, we think of them as life forms, but so is broccoli. That's a life form
*  as well. But there there's actually more evidence that plants are intelligent than there is that
*  mollusks are. Mollusks are an incredibly ancient life form. But then again, don't you get some
*  sort of mercury poisoning from them as well? Well, they're on the bottom, right? Usually,
*  and they're filtering. So you're getting whatever toxins there are. I'm not going to say that
*  mollusks are poison. I just wouldn't eat it. I'm going a completely different direction,
*  but I've heard that before, that mollusks are- You can farm them too, right?
*  You can. I mean, if we really can break down that they're even more primitive, but yet more
*  nutritious. God, I did a story in Polynesia on oysters, and they have the big oysters that they
*  get put through for pearls. And they just eat the muscle that holds all the organs and stuff on.
*  When I said, oh, in America, we eat the whole oyster, they're like, what? Because the muscle
*  tastes like fish flesh. It's actually pretty good. But the idea that we're eating all those
*  other filtered organs and stuff, I just don't know. I don't-
*  But you don't know. I don't know.
*  Has anybody come up with any sort of comprehensive plan or anything that makes sense
*  where they can viably repopulate the ocean? I mean, the idea of stopping and slowing down fishing
*  would be wonderful. But if it really gets to a point where we've got to somehow or another
*  independently grow these fish and reintroduce them to the wild, I mean, is there any talk of
*  doing things like that? Or is it even impossible? I think it's impossible the scale of what's going
*  on right now. When I was in Japan, they were saying that we used to go out, we could fill up
*  a boat in a day. Now it's eight days. Then we have to go out 30, and we're competing with the
*  Koreans, the Chinese, the Taiwanese. And everybody's just going gangbusters.
*  And we're using military gear to sonar to catch things at this unprecedented rate. It's not
*  sustainable. I personally don't believe that fishing, to feeding this planet currently,
*  you can do it with fish. I don't think you can do it with- And we know
*  what's- that the unethical side of raising farm animals for this is it's just- I think we have
*  to transition to another form. I think it's going to be 10 or 12 years, but I think we're headed
*  that direction. I think what you're seeing now is that there's a direction towards
*  people want to eat healthier, they want to eat sustainable. And I know you're a hunter. I was a
*  hunter too. I hunted fish. I understand when you come back with the goods, you come back with an
*  animal, and you're feeding your family, you're feeding your friends, you feel like the man.
*  There's something you tap in that's really primitive in a really genuine way that makes
*  us feel good about who we are, that you're providing. And I know that that happened when
*  I was a fisherman. You go hunt a fish with your friends, and there's a group thing going on, and
*  everybody's there, they're enjoying themselves, and it feels wonderful. But we can't do it with
*  wild fish. With 4% of the biomass being wild animals now, and the rest of it being-
*  It's not sustainable. And I wish it was because
*  there's something we lost with that. But we have to transition. We're at that period right now
*  where we have to figure out how do you feed a planet?
*  Pete Slauson That's the real problem, right? And not just how do you feed a planet. How do you feed
*  a planet that may double its population in the next 50 years?
*  Yeah, well, they're still talking 10 billion by 2050, and we're already at a point where,
*  you know, we're at the-
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, so 20 years past that, it might really be double. It might be 15 million,
*  or excuse me, billion people. That's crazy.
*  Pete Slauson So, you know, you can't have 18 and a half million people in the greater Los Angeles
*  area going out and hunting for their food or fishing for-
*  Pete Slauson No.
*  Pete Slauson So, what are we going to eat? I think the way to do it is,
*  you know, drifting more towards plants. Getting, you know, I was, last week I was in Loma Linda,
*  California. You know where that's at? You've heard about one of the blue zones?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson And, you know, so it's for the people out there that might not know about it,
*  Dan Buettner, a geographic fellow, popularized the idea that there's these five geographic regions
*  on the planet where people live longer and without chronic disease than any other place on the planet.
*  So, I was out there last week at the Brain Health and Alzheimer Clinic.
*  And there's two researchers that started one. There wasn't one for miles around.
*  And they opened it, you know, one out of three people in America in the next 10 years are going
*  to be affected by Alzheimer's. They're going to have it, their mate's going to have it, they're
*  going to be taking care of somebody that has it, their parents. So, it's going to overtake heart
*  diseases or number one disease that we have. They opened up the Brain Health Clinic there,
*  an Alzheimer Clinic, and nobody came. Now, about half the population is seventh day
*  Adventists. They're vegetarians by religion. And you go to the grocery store, they don't sell meat,
*  you go to, they have milk, they have cow's milk, but it's on the bottom shelf. They just have a few
*  things of it. And they, to find people initially, they had to go to San Bernardino across the
*  highway. There's nothing different, geologically different between San Bernardino and Loma Linda.
*  It's, they're right, you know, drinking the same water, breathing the same air, but they have a
*  different diet. But they're living about 10 years longer than everybody. You have,
*  San Bernardino is one of the unhealthiest populations in America, and on the other side
*  of Highway 10, you have one of the healthiest populations in the entire world. And they're
*  living about 10 years on average longer. They're doing other things too. It's not just diet.
*  Well, it's a big factor, sleep. I mean, Dr. Matthew Walker has been on this podcast,
*  who's a well-renowned sleep scientist, was discussing that it's one of the biggest corollary,
*  one of the biggest factors where they've determined that the less sleep you have,
*  the higher likelihood you have of Alzheimer's disease. And it's really stark. Like the numbers
*  are, they're pretty undisputable. Yeah, well, I agree. They have four principles,
*  you know, the surezies, you know, Dean and Aisha's surezies. Sleep is one of them. Whole
*  foods, plant-based diet, support, you know, the community support and exercise. Those are the big
*  ones. But out of the 3,000 people that they have in the Alzheimer's clinic now, only 19 of them,
*  or sorry, only 13 of them are vegetarians and three vegans. So, I mean, you look at, you know,
*  if you look at, if you break it down, the population, like how many of the 24,000 people
*  there that are vegetarians, about 15%, you'd expect, you know, several hundred of them to be,
*  you know, with Alzheimer's to be vegetarians. So many of them are following that seventh day
*  Adventist diet, which is vegetarian. Yeah. And what you're talking about, San Bernardino is a
*  very poor community, unfortunately. And I think you know as well as I do, a lot of people in poor
*  communities eat terrible. It's true. You know, and you're eating junk food and sugar and all that crap.
*  I mean, that's one of the primary factors when it comes to poor health and education.
*  Education is related definitely to brain health, unfortunately. And it says to us to do that they're
*  stupid. It's just that they're, you're right, they're not eating as well. They have to, you know,
*  the first McDonald's was in San Bernardino, you know. Was it really? Yeah. We went to the museum
*  there, the McDonald's museum. They have a McDonald's museum. Do they have all the Ronald McDonald's
*  from the beginning to the end? Everything, yeah. Yeah. So they've been really good about keeping
*  fast food out of Loma Linda for- Isn't there giant concerns even with large scale agriculture
*  when you're talking about mono crops and growing things for 15 billion people, you're going to need
*  gigantic swassle land. It's going to displace a lot of wildlife. You're going to have a lot of
*  different chemicals that get released into the ground unless you're doing regenerative farming,
*  in which case you're going to have to use some animal products anyway because you have compost
*  and fertilizer. You need fish for fertilizer or something that creates nitrogen. There's a lot
*  of issues even with large scale agriculture when you're growing crops. You're doing something
*  that's wholly unnatural. If you have, you know, a thousand acres of corn or soybeans or anything
*  that you're growing in large scale, that's not how nature intends it. Nature intends everything to be
*  combined together. Right, but if you look at the amount of crops that are out there, most land is
*  being used to grow crops to feed animals. Well, sort of. A lot of it's being used to feed animals.
*  A lot of it's being used for corn syrup and a lot of different- And we can agree on that.
*  And get rid of it. Yeah. I mean, you've seen king corn, right? Yeah. So that's pretty fucking crazy
*  when they check your DNA and they find out how much of your DNA is corn based. And you're like,
*  what? Like, what is going on? Or how much of your cellular structure is corn based? It's like,
*  how much corn is in your diet? And then you go through the supermarket and go and pick up
*  box after box and read how much corn is in there. Corn starch, corn syrup, different proteins that
*  they've extracted from corn. Well, let me ask you, how do you think, you know, if we have to feed
*  10, 15 billion people in the future, how do you think-
*  Good question.
*  You know, we should be feeding the population.
*  That's a good question. It's a very good question. I have hope for this fake meat shit.
*  Not the plant-based stuff where they're using oils, but the actual physical meat
*  that they can figure out some way to create meat without animals dying.
*  I am not a fan of factory farming. It's the reason why I got into hunting in the first place. I saw
*  a lot of those PETA documentaries and I just didn't want to have any part of any of that shit.
*  I know there are ethical ranchers that raise their animals grass-fed and they let them
*  roam. There's a guy named Joel Salatin who has this thing called Polyface Farms where he
*  teaches people regenerative farming methods and teaches people how to let animals be animals.
*  The polar opposite of factory farming. When you see these, and I'm sure you've seen some of these
*  disgusting videos of these pig farms where they have lakes of sewage attached to these farms
*  where these pigs are in these warehouses stacked in one on top of the other and then all their
*  waste goes down through the floor and into these giant huge lakes of shit and piss.
*  They spray it on the crops.
*  I don't know if they spray that on the crops, but it leaks into the ground.
*  They spray the pig and shit on the-
*  On the crop. Oh yeah.
*  Well, look, all that stuff is wrong. I mean, all of it's wrong. I mean, whether it's chickens
*  raising chickens like that or cows like that or pigs like that. There's a reason why they have
*  these ag-gag laws. Those are another thing that are akin in my eyes to the same thing that the way
*  we feel about dolphins in captivity in a place like SeaWorld. Those ag-gag laws, agricultural
*  laws, they keep people from divulging the horrors of these factory farms and there's gotta be a way
*  to stop those laws, first of all. These places should be transparent. If there's something
*  they're doing that's abhorrent, there's something they do where you could see the lives of these
*  animals when they're treated in these horrific ways. It's not necessary. It's just, they're doing
*  that for profit and this is why you can get a chicken sandwich for $1.99 or whatever the fuck
*  it is. Yeah. I mean, if like, you know, the saying of slaughterhouses had glass walls.
*  Yes. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But going back to it though, I mean, so how do you, so LabMeat,
*  you think would be the- I think LabMeat has real potential. The same way cell phones used to cost,
*  you know, $1,000. More than that. Like what was like one of those big molderola bricks?
*  Remember those things that like Gordon Gekko had on Wall Street? They were really expensive. Like
*  when he was walking down the beach with that thing, like, wow, that guy's a baller. He's got a phone.
*  He's just walking with no cord. Now everyone has a phone. I mean, I was in Brazil and, you know,
*  these people were walking around. They had, you know, very little money, but they all had phones.
*  Cell phones have made their way throughout virtually all of the world. How much? Four grand.
*  Four grand. So four grand in 82 is probably what today? 20? Probably like 20, right? Sure. Yeah.
*  It's a lot. Let's just say it's a lot. Even if it's four grand. If imagine if a fucking iPhone
*  was four grand, people would be going crazy. The new one's almost two grand and everybody's going
*  crazy. So that just- I think that sort of technological innovation and improvement,
*  I think we were going to see that in this sort of factory created meat because the original
*  factory created burger that they made, I believe it was a quarter of a million dollars
*  that it costs to create one and people ate it and they're like, this is beef. This is like real beef.
*  I think with innovation, they could figure out a way to do that. So we don't ever have to have these
*  factory farming situations. I mean, I think that's possible. Yeah. No, I think it is too. When I've
*  talked to some of the people that are working on that and when you look at how fast cells can
*  reproduce, it's just a matter of scale and getting the right texture and taste. Yes. Look, I'm
*  under no illusion that what I do is available to everybody. I go hunting in the mountains. Most
*  people don't want to do that. When I do it with a bow and arrow, most people don't want to learn
*  how to do that. They don't have it in them. They don't want it. It's not interesting to me.
*  It is if I shoot one elk, that is 400 pounds of meat. One life feeds me for a year and I feed
*  my friends. I feed a lot of people. I give elk meat out to a bunch of people. I'm under no illusion
*  that everyone can do that, but everyone can't do most of the things that I do. I just do it because
*  it makes me feel better than going and getting something that's factory farmed. If I saw what
*  they did to chickens and I knew that my chicken had come from these horrific environments and I
*  ate that, I'd feel sick. Yeah. That's why I became a hunter in the first place.
*  Yeah. Well, what we concern ourselves is like, you and I can eat, you're probably better than me,
*  but I can eat how I want to eat. Doesn't that sound weird? You say I eat better than you?
*  No, what you can afford more is what I'm saying. Is that what it is? But I'm telling you,
*  I'm getting my meat from the woods. Well, I'm not saying better. I'm saying that you can eat
*  how you want. Oh, I see what you're saying. You're easier than me. I'm just saying I'm not.
*  Financially. I've seen what you have around here. Nice little cozy man-din you have down here,
*  but boys, you should see what's out there. It's like the ultimate caveman.
*  Not caveman, but man cave. Caveman would be a giant Neanderthal.
*  But yeah, it's the conversation between, I mean, I have a gang of friends that are vegan and
*  vegetarian. One of my best friends is vegan, Ian Edwards. I love him to death. I don't dispute
*  that we're in a conundrum and that we're in a terrible situation as a civilization. We've
*  certainly overpopulated the planet in many ways. And we've certainly allowed something to take
*  root in our society that I think is disgusting. And that's factory farming of animals. There's
*  something vile about it, undeniably vile. And there's a reason why people are prosecuted
*  for exposing what makes everybody sick. If they exposed it and said, look, I'm going to take a
*  picture, I'm going to show you a video of how these cows are living. And you take the video
*  and the cows just wandering around eating grass. No one would give a shit. It's when you see these
*  people kicking these cows and when you see them alive, like kosher, the way they do that, where
*  they have to slice their throat and they have to do it with one cut. And this is why people want
*  kosher meat, like some ancient, ridiculous idea of how to dispose of a life.
*  I mean, all those things sicken people, which is the reason why they have those laws keeping
*  people who work there from videotaping, exposing it in the first place.
*  Yeah. I think the King amendment, I believe what it is, is from Iowa, or at least it was. I'm not
*  sure if he's still even in power there. But yeah, but if people saw how milk is done,
*  I know you're a proponent of milk, but if you saw that-
*  Not really. I don't drink it.
*  Really?
*  No. If I drink four glasses of milk a year, it's a lot.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah. I don't think it's good for you. I think raw milk is probably better for you,
*  but every time I drink a glass of milk, I always feel gross. I feel like the homogenization in
*  pasteurization of milk, you're breaking down all the enzymes and boiling it. What you get is some
*  weird protein that your body doesn't exactly know how to process correctly. There's a reason why so
*  many people get horrible gas off of it. Yeah. So 65% of the population of the world's lactose
*  intolerant? My nine-year-old, she's lactose intolerant. She can't have anything with cheese
*  or milk or anything. I didn't figure that out until I was like 50 that it was lactose intolerant.
*  I mean, really. I should have figured it out, but I just thought it was normal.
*  I think my daughter gets it from me. I can eat ice cream and I'm okay, but I always feel like shit.
*  It never makes me feel good afterwards. I always feel like, I'll have cookies and milk,
*  and then I'll be like, it's just a weird ... My body's like, what is this? However, I've had
*  raw milk and I haven't had any problems with it. I just think it's ... There's a big problem with
*  acquiring raw milk. It's very hard to get, but I think if people are going to drink milk at all,
*  that's how we're supposed to drink it. I don't think we're supposed to be boiling that stuff.
*  It comes out, it's dead. That's why ... Look, you're not supposed to have anything biological
*  that can sit in your fucking refrigerator for two weeks and not stink. How is that?
*  You look at the date, the date is like a month. How the fuck is this going to stay good for a month?
*  Because they boil the shit out of it. Look, if you want to serve milk to 300 million people,
*  that's how you have to do it. If you want to get it in containers and travel across the country in
*  these trucks and get it to supermarkets and have it sit on the shelf and have it be financially
*  viable for them to be able to hold onto it long enough for them to sell it and turn a profit,
*  and then have no one get sick from it, because raw milk is good for a couple of days.
*  And it used to be that people got their milk delivered on their doorstop. The milk man,
*  that was the thing. The milk man used to come to your house and you didn't even really have a lid.
*  It had that little- Paper.
*  Yeah, a little paper thing that you'd pull off.
*  That's what we had as a kid.
*  Yeah, it was fresh. The cream would sit on the top of it and it just tasted different.
*  I've had raw milk. I haven't had it in years, but the last time I had raw milk, I was like,
*  this just tastes better. It tastes like when you drink it, it feels like your body is like,
*  oh, I know what this is. Whereas a regular glass of milk, my body's like, what in the fuck?
*  And then you got to think about how they get it, right? How they keep these cows pregnant
*  and the process of acquiring billions of gallons of milk for millions and millions of people.
*  It's kind of gross. Not even kind of.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  Yeah. But however, almond milk's disgusting. You don't drink that shit, do you?
*  Why do you say that?
*  It's just gross. It's just not milk, man. Almonds don't have tits. What are you doing to that
*  water? Just have a glass of water or drink some juice or something. It's just gotta be some
*  benefit. Almonds are good for you, right? But almonds are a real problem in California
*  ecologically because of the amount of water they use.
*  Totally agree. Soy milk's sort of my milkless choice or oat milk.
*  Yeah. Just drink water, man.
*  I agree. I agree, but not out of plastic.
*  Okay, just hide this.
*  I know. We have to do something about that. We've been talking forever. We're gonna develop
*  some sort of a system here. What do you recommend for us with water?
*  Plastic.
*  Right. But where should we get our water from? Should we get filtered water or should we get
*  spring water?
*  I think filtered water's probably good.
*  By canned or boxed water. That's the thing, though.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, but they use this paper.
*  Yeah, just so it's a big tank. It's some garbage water.
*  Yeah.
*  We're working on a film on plastic pollution right now, and we're trying to think, how do you...
*  It's a big problem. You look at the oceans here.
*  We've had Boyon Slot on, and we're gonna have him on again. He's the guy who's created that filter.
*  Yeah, he came up to visit me too where I work.
*  He's got new ones for the rivers. Have you seen the new ones that he's...
*  I saw that, yeah, a couple weeks ago, I think they were doing something.
*  He's already got them working.
*  But here's the issue that I'm learning from. There's this guy, Andrew Forrest,
*  one of the wealthiest guys in Australia, told me that this isn't the problem. It's that you're
*  having cheap plastic made in Saudi Arabia and America, and it's being exported to... There's
*  10, 11 rivers where the majority of the plastic in the ocean are coming from, and it's not recyclable.
*  Rivers is where the plastic's coming from? What do you mean?
*  There's about 10 to 12 rivers over in Southeast Asia that generate a lot of... Most of the plastic
*  that you see in the ocean. How in the river? What is...
*  Okay, so in Indonesia, for instance, you have 17,000 islands, but only 10 recycling plants,
*  places to do it. So there's nowhere to throw it. So they throw it out in the ocean.
*  Oh, you're saying the garbage is in these rivers.
*  I'm saying the creation of the plastic.
*  The creation of the plastic comes from America, and it comes from Europe,
*  and it comes from Saudi Arabia.
*  Right, right. I see what you're saying.
*  But the volume, most of the volume is coming from these 10 to 12 rivers in Southeast Asia. You have
*  to make plastic cost enough so that they... First of all, that they can make it recyclable so that
*  there's different ways to make polymers so that they can recycle it. They just do it the cheapest
*  way possible because they know it's not coming back. So you have to put a tax on virgin plastic
*  to make it valuable for people to be able to recycle it. Otherwise...
*  A great solution is hemp plastic. It's biodegradable and it comes from this plant.
*  You can make hemp plastic, and we can grow it, and it's an easy crop to grow.
*  Is that scalable?
*  Yes. Hemp is so weird, it doesn't even seem like it should be real. It really doesn't. It's an insane
*  plant. You can make hempcrete out of it, which is far better than any building material we currently
*  use. It's far more resistant to flame. There's just so many positive benefits of it in terms
*  of insulation. The insulation factor is better than wood or plywood. It's really lightweight,
*  but incredibly strong. Have you ever grabbed a thick hemp stalk? Have you ever held onto one?
*  No.
*  It doesn't seem real. It's hard like this oak, but yet it's light like balsa wood. It's so strange.
*  It feels like it comes from another planet. Hemp is an extraordinary planet.
*  Most extraordinary plant we have. First of all, it has all the essential amino acids.
*  I love hemp protein. It's one of my favorite proteins. We sell hemp protein. It's one of the
*  very best proteins in terms of being able to mix it and like a protein shake. On the go,
*  your body digests it super easily. It's filled with amino acids. It's very easy for your body
*  to digest and process. You can make oil out of it that they used to use for heating lamps.
*  You can cook your food in it. There's so many different things you can do with hemp. You can
*  make clothing. You can make far more durable cloth. Far more durable. The paper is far superior.
*  In fact, the whole reason why William Randolph Hearst demonized marijuana in the first place
*  was to protect his business because he had paper mills and he was trying to protect it from hemp.
*  Because on the cover of Popular Science magazine, they had come out with a decorticator.
*  A decorticator was a way in the 1930s they devised to effectively process hemp fiber.
*  Because for years, they used to use slaves to process hemp. Then when they figured out the
*  cotton gin, cotton became easier to use and then slavery became outlawed. And so people shied away
*  from hemp. Well, they came up with this decorticator in the 1930s. It was on the cover of
*  Popular Science magazine, Hemp, the New Billion Dollar Crop. Well, William Randolph Hearst didn't
*  just own Hearst publications and newspapers. He also owned these huge forests that they were
*  making paper with. So he, along with Harry Anslinger and using his newspapers, demonized
*  marijuana to stop the commodity of hemp. Yes.
*  No idea.
*  He funded all those fucking crazy marijuana movies, Reefer Madness, all that shit. That was all him.
*  They came up with these stories that these Mexicans and black men were taking this new drug called
*  marijuana. Marijuana wasn't even a term for cannabis. Marijuana was a term for a wild tobacco.
*  So they came up with this new name. They called it this drug. Everybody freaked out because they
*  didn't have the internet back then. No one had access to real information other than Hearst
*  newspapers, Hearst publications. So he just fucking out and out lied and made up these crazy
*  stories and funded these documentaries. And then marijuana became illegal and still is to this day.
*  And you still have knuckleheads like Joe Biden literally yesterday saying that he thinks marijuana
*  is a gateway drug. We're still in this. Forget about marijuana. Imagine if it wasn't psychoactive
*  at all. The idea that hemp should be illegal until really recently in this country is a
*  fucking travesty. It's horrific. It's food. It's clothes. It's paper. It doesn't even make sense
*  that it could be so many things. It's literally like one of the most positive plants the earth's
*  ever known. Okay. I'll vote for it. Dude, you should do a next documentary on that. I think he
*  got to Joe Biden. Joe, fuck you. Too late. There's a lot to talk on here where I stand. Oh, one hour
*  ago, I put my fucking Instagram post out this morning. It's got, and they did this one. I
*  basically had a well worded thing saying that anyone who thinks that marijuana should be legal
*  is basically saying you should be locked in a cage for experimenting with your consciousness
*  and the freedom to do whatever you want with your body that is, especially with marijuana,
*  that's not poisonous. No one's died of it ever, ever in the history of the human race.
*  There's never been a single overdose from marijuana. And this knucklehead saying that it's a gateway
*  drug. No pain is a gateway drug. Trauma is a gateway drug. Abuse is a gateway to drugs.
*  It's not marijuana. Marijuana is just a time honored psychedelic substance that people have
*  been enjoying for thousands and thousands of years. They should run for Congress. Fuck that.
*  I'm not running for anything. I'm not even running for my neighborhoods, whatever the hell it is.
*  I just saw a poster over there. Did you run for mayor or was that a joke?
*  What poster? I thought that was a poster. Oh, it's a hundred percent a joke. Look,
*  I'm not ever running for anything ever. Well, it was right next to Hunter Thompson for mayor.
*  And I thought, well, maybe there was some truth to it. No, it was Hunter Thompson for sheriff,
*  but there's nothing there for me. Is there anything for me? I don't think that's just Hunter Thompson.
*  That's not me. Look, I'm not running for anything ever. I have three jobs and three kids.
*  I'm busy and I have a lot of hobbies, too many hobbies. I'm trying to chip away at hobbies.
*  But if I can get Joe Biden to shut the fuck up, I'm very happy.
*  Crazy asshole. There's so many people that smoke pot in this country. He's so crazy.
*  For him to come out against that is so goddamn dumb.
*  How do you smoke pot on the show and still hold the conversation though?
*  Let's see. I'll smoke it right now. No, no, no, no.
*  Oh, it's not hard? You'll be doing it for yourself.
*  Because I'm a stoner. I know how to do it, man. I've been doing it forever.
*  Look, one of the things that I said in my Instagram post today, marijuana is not for everybody. And I
*  think it should be used carefully because look, I've said a lot of dumb shit when I've been high.
*  I've thought a lot of dumb shit. I've been paranoid. It's not for everybody. I think it
*  should be treated cautiously, but there's a lot of benefits to it. I really firmly believe that it's
*  made me a more sensitive person. It's made me more interested in community. It's made me more
*  aware of how important it is that we're all connected and that we all converse with each
*  other in a calm way. It's made me feel better about happy communication with people. It's
*  made me more affectionate. It's made me more compassionate, more kind. It makes me more aware.
*  You know, the feeling of paranoia, one of the things that that paranoia is,
*  is just an overall expanding of your awareness of your vulnerability.
*  Of all the things you've done, because you had a lot of hats in your career, do you find this the
*  most satisfying to you with the podcast? Yeah. Mom made this in standup. I mean,
*  this is standup is more complicated, right? Because there's got to be an end result. It
*  has to be funny. Whereas this, the beautiful thing about this is I've been able to expose
*  a lot of people to things like the Cove, like you and your work, like, I mean, so many different
*  doctors and scientists and astrophysicists and Dr. Matthew Walker that we talked about earlier,
*  where explaining sleep and how important this really is. This isn't just something that you
*  feel better if you get more sleep. No, it's like long-term for your life. These are all little
*  bits of information that I think it's very difficult for people to absorb just by going out and
*  reading studies, right? So the next best thing is reading a book. Well, the next best thing is
*  me having a person who wrote that book on a podcast to talk about it. And maybe not even
*  the next best thing. It might be the best best thing because it's absorbable. It's a conversation
*  with people. And it's to me, I've gotten a fantastic education from it, to being able to talk to
*  thousands of brilliant people or hundreds at least of brilliant people and pick their brain
*  and just with genuine curiosity, just ask them questions and read their book and then try to
*  have an understanding of it and try to, when they come on the show, try to get them to fill in my
*  blanks and in turn educate the audience on things that may be a little bit complicated for them to
*  comprehend. And it's just to me, it's something that was completely unexpected. I didn't ever
*  plan on doing this. I just started doing it and then it just kind of became what it is now.
*  So it's very satisfying that people like it. When I talk to people and they say,
*  I can't tell you how many people I've run into that said it's changed their life,
*  it's changed their perspective. So many people said, once I started, I was going to be on the
*  show, they said, oh, we got to see this podcast. I spent two weeks, that was my day job, is like
*  listening to interviews that you've done. I just felt totally captivated and envious of the position
*  that you're in to be able to have people and talk about a wide range of stuff. When I do a film,
*  it's so targeted that I'm needing them to fill in a blank. And it's just, I need two or three
*  minutes and I might talk as long, but I've got this list of, a shopping list of things I need
*  to cover and here you just have a conversation. It's a lot different and it seems like a lot more
*  fun. It's a lot more fun. Like when you said at the beginning of this, what kind of research
*  have you done to prepare for this? I'm like, fortunately, I get to pick who I talk to. And
*  for you, I knew that you had directed The Cove and that the subject of dolphins has been, I mean,
*  it was a huge bit on my 2016 Netflix special about an experience that I had when I was in Hawaii,
*  high as fuck on edibles. And we ran into this patch of wild dolphins and they were playing with us.
*  They were playing with us and we were yelling like, yay! And they would jump out of the water
*  and do flips for you. They were putting on a show. And I remember having this thought,
*  like, holy shit, they're playing with us. These are these wild creatures and they're having fun
*  with us. And then I started doing all this research on dolphins and dolphin communication.
*  I became obsessed with dolphins because this one, I mean, I had been fascinated by them before,
*  but I became truly obsessed. And this was, this experience was more than 10 years ago.
*  And since then, I've just, I've been overwhelmed and also massively disheartened by just, you know,
*  by films like yours and by seeing SeaWorld and by seeing what was going on in Marine land with my
*  friend Phil. And I've had him on a bunch of times to talk about his lawsuits. I mean, they have done
*  everything they can to try to silence that guy and stop him from revealing all the horrors of that
*  place. But slowly but surely he's had a massive impact on that place's business to the point where
*  they're trying to just get him to shut up. And he won't, he won't. I mean, he was on the inside,
*  he was a trainer and all that stuff. So for me to be able to talk to someone like you,
*  it's, you know, it's, I love the fact that we can get that out there.
*  Pete Iuorio Well, I appreciate it. Yeah. I mean,
*  let's, you know, swimming with dolphins in the wild, there was a triggered a memory over in
*  Rangiroa with our team and there was three groups of resident dolphins. So, they're hanging out there
*  all the time. You get to recognize them. And we were playing with them. And the more you play with
*  them, the more you can spin around, the more you can, you know, the more excited they get.
*  And they could only do it for so long. And I remember once that we were doing it, we finally,
*  we had scooters and we thought, well, the more, so, a dolphin looks at you and you can't,
*  you look like you're like in a wheelchair.
*  Pete Liesveld Not even.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, right.
*  Pete Liesveld So, a wheelchair can get around pretty good.
*  Pete Liesveld But, you know, in the water, we just look like,
*  you know, we're just pitiful. So, they can only be entertained so long. But the scooters,
*  we figured we could engage them a lot longer. And then all of a sudden this group just took off.
*  And they're sort of, you're let down because you're high from the experience of being with
*  them in the wild. And they took off and we saw that there was about an 18 foot long hammerhead.
*  And they were taking turns ramming it away from us.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow!
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah. So, it was like, not only were they playing with us, they were protecting us.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow, that must have been wild though, seeing an 18 foot long hammerhead.
*  Holy shit!
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, because they disappeared into the blue and then we could see them
*  ramming the thing. The dolphins were big. I mean, they're, you know, not quite as long as this table,
*  but they're, you know, they're probably three to 500 pounds and they're maybe seven feet long.
*  And they look tiny next to this shark.
*  Pete Liesveld Wow! That's wild.
*  Pete Liesveld That is wild. Yeah. Occasionally, you see, they'll do drone footage off of the
*  coast of Malibu and you see like a great white swimming around there just a few hundred yards
*  away from surfers.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh man, my son does that with drones. He goes out in his kayak and films them.
*  Pete Liesveld My friend Peter, Peter Attia, he's a, he's done a bunch of like crazy endurance
*  things and one of the things he did, he swam, he swam to all the islands in Hawaii and to prepare
*  for this, he had to do a lot of swimming. He lives in San Diego and swimming in the coast out there
*  and he was swimming literally, what do you say, like a couple days after that guy got bit in half?
*  Pete Liesveld Oh my God.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, I think it was just –
*  Jared Sussman He wasn't scared of it. You know, he wasn't scared of it. I think it might have been
*  the next day.
*  Pete Liesveld I was a little freaked out but it was within a few days of one of the guys who got
*  bit in half down in San Diego.
*  Pete Liesveld When did this happen?
*  Pete Liesveld The San Diego incident, I want to say it was ten years ago, somewhere in the
*  neighborhood of ten years ago and then there was one in Santa Barbara that happened about four years
*  ago, four or five years ago. You know, occasionally they slip up, think a person's a seal or something.
*  Most of the time, I've dove with a lot of sharks before. You can only, you usually only get them
*  around you if you're feeding them and that feels so horrible. It's just so unnatural. I won't do
*  it anymore. But –
*  Jared Sussman It's weird, right?
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, it's just not, I couldn't be around it. There's some friends of mine that
*  were feeding it, you know, they're on a feed and I was about, I don't know, maybe 50 yards away
*  and I thought I just don't want to be part of it and I was just filming on the reef
*  and these silver tips came over and I don't know if they were excited by it. I had a camera with
*  the strobes on it but they just came in, they were like attacking me and I had a re-breather,
*  I dove with a re-breather so you could scream. So, I started screaming as loud as I could through
*  this thing but I was pushing them off and they were like working together. You could see it was
*  like packed, you know, like one would go this way, one would go this way so you had to like,
*  I had these lights with these like octopus with four lights on it and I could push them away but
*  then one of the guys that we had brought over a tuna head and lured them away.
*  Pete Liesveld I bet.
*  Jared Sussman But they were just, it was because they were excited by,
*  you know, the feeding over there so I just, I don't even want to be in the water these days
*  when people are feeding sharks because it's no joke, when you're under the water, it's not like
*  you can just run up a tree, there's no place to go.
*  Pete Liesveld No, there's nowhere to go, you feel helpless and that's their natural environment and
*  that's what they're there for. They're there to clean up, you know, anything that's weak,
*  anything that's fucked up, anything, you know, any seal that gets caught slipping,
*  they're there for population control. I mean, there's a really powerful video off of the,
*  I'm sure you've probably seen it, off of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco where a bunch of
*  tourists are there and boom, this great white snatch has a seal right in front of everybody and
*  just thunderous explosion of blood and foam in the water and like, whoa!
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, it's a couple miles from where I live.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah, I mean, they're magic. That's a crazy beast.
*  Pete Liesveld I'm supposed to, somebody just invited me today to go out
*  and be with great whites, not diving, just to watch.
*  Jared Sussman Just to watch.
*  Pete Liesveld There's a crazy video from, I think it was the Cape,
*  somewhere around the Cape Cod where there's like a 20 foot one next to a boat and these guys were
*  in this boat and this great white just swims right up next to them and they start fucking
*  screaming and freaking out and it's enormous. It's like 20 feet long.
*  Pete Liesveld The only, like, if you don't feed them,
*  they're usually fairly, if you're feeding them or if you're spear hunting, then they'll come near you.
*  Jared Sussman They're dangerous for spear hunters, yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Jared Sussman What is this? Record breaking year for sharks off Cape Cod.
*  Yeah, apparently there's a lot of them out there now. What do you think that, is that because of a
*  large number of marine mammals?
*  Pete Liesveld Or drones, we can actually see them now.
*  Jared Sussman Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
*  So listen, man, I want to thank you for coming here. It was a very cool conversation.
*  Pete Liesveld Thanks for having me.
*  Jared Sussman And if people want to see the Cove, it's available on…
*  Pete Liesveld Boy, that's a good question. I think you'd still see it on iTunes. You can buy it.
*  Jared Sussman Is it on Netflix?
*  Pete Liesveld Not Netflix.
*  Jared Sussman No, but iTunes is available there. Amazon,
*  can you get it on Amazon?
*  Pete Liesveld Yep. Racing Extinction is a little bit harder. I'm not sure where you can get that
*  one, but I think that's better than the Cove in a lot of ways.
*  Jared Sussman Okay, well check it out. I watched it. The Cove was pretty powerful, man.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, well thanks. Appreciate it.
*  Jared Sussman Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks for being here.
*  Pete Liesveld Thanks for having me.
*  Jared Sussman Bye, everybody.
