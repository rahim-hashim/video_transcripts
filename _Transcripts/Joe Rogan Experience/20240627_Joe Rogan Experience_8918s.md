# Joe Rogan Experience #1976 - James Fox
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello, James. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=12.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=13.0s)]
*  Good to see you, my man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=14.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=15.0s)]
*  Oh, my pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=16.0s)]
*  The moment I saw that documentary, I was like, wow. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=17.0s)]
*  Let me just be honest, off the bat. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=20.0s)]
*  I loved your first documentary, but when someone says there's a documentary about a crashed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=22.0s)]
*  UFO and it happened in Brazil, I'm always like, man, people tell stories. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=26.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, maybe it was one of those. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=30.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't think too much of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=32.0s)]
*  When I hear stories, even Roswell, I always go, man, I don't know. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=34.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's so hard to know. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=38.0s)]
*  1947, you know, I think some shenanigans are going on, but what was it really? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=40.0s)]
*  And how much of this is just people tell stories and those stories grow and change [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=45.0s)]
*  over the years and, you know, almost like the story becomes their real memory after a while [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=49.0s)]
*  because they've been doing it for, you know, so many, so many years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=55.0s)]
*  But then this one, this one, just right away, the way you captured all the information [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=58.0s)]
*  and the evidence and the eyewitness accounts, the photographs that people got, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=67.0s)]
*  the depictions of the actual being, the fact that there was live beings, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=73.0s)]
*  this is a really, and everyone that didn't even know each other having these like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=78.0s)]
*  really similar stories about what they saw and when people got a hold of the wreckage, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=83.0s)]
*  like when you first started making this documentary, did you have any apprehension? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=88.0s)]
*  Like, oh, this one, how do I sell a documentary on a crashed UFO? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=93.0s)]
*  Like, what's the best way to put this together? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=98.0s)]
*  Because that's part of the art of what you do, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=101.0s)]
*  You were skeptical. Let me tell you how skeptical I was. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=103.0s)]
*  Okay, so I was making my second documentary on UFOs in the late 90s. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=108.0s)]
*  I just finished a documentary called UFOs, 50 Years of Denial. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=114.0s)]
*  I'm starting on my second film. It was 1999. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=119.0s)]
*  And I partner up with a couple of guys. Boris Zuboff has been a partner. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=123.0s)]
*  I'm still working with him today. And this guy, Tim Coleman, who's a British reporter. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=126.0s)]
*  And we like mapping out the film concept, like, hey, we should cover this case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=131.0s)]
*  We should do that. And he's like, hey, mate, we got to do this amazing UFO crash in Brazil [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=135.0s)]
*  with these aliens. We're walking around the town. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=140.0s)]
*  And I looked at the guy and I thought, I think I picked the wrong partner. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=142.0s)]
*  This guy's fucking batshit crazy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=145.0s)]
*  And literally, I dismissed it on the spot. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=147.0s)]
*  And I refused to even read one word about it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=151.0s)]
*  I said, there's no way in hell that that happened and the whole world doesn't know about it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=154.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=159.0s)]
*  So I have to remind your audience, I was making my second documentary on UFOs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=160.0s)]
*  And I dismissed it like this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=167.0s)]
*  Like, how fast can you say howdy doody? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=171.0s)]
*  It just always seems like if someone's telling you about something like that, like you would have heard about it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=173.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I can't tell you, Joe, how quickly I dismissed it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=178.0s)]
*  And I didn't look into it till 2011. OK, so here's what happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=181.0s)]
*  I'm going to I get invited by this guy, AJ Javard, to a place called Pero Ibi in Brazil. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=186.0s)]
*  And I'm speaking at a conference about a film I did called I Know What I Saw. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=194.0s)]
*  And this guy calls me, Jeff Zagansky, who's very high up on the food chain in the entertainment industry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=199.0s)]
*  He's been kind of like my mentor and opening doors for me over the years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=205.0s)]
*  And I've asked him over a period of time, like, why are you so kind to me? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=208.0s)]
*  He's a very wealthy guy in New York. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=211.0s)]
*  And he goes, you know, Jackie Gleason told me one time that these things were real. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=213.0s)]
*  Don't don't listen to anybody else. I know for a fact. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=216.0s)]
*  And so when I saw you as an independent, struggling young filmmaker, I always wanted to lend a helping hand. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=220.0s)]
*  And by the way, you're going to Brazil, you got to look into that Varginha case. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=226.0s)]
*  And I thought, oh, God, not this again. I swear to God. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=231.0s)]
*  So I was like, well, I had a lot of respect for Jeff Zagansky. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=234.0s)]
*  I mean, you can look him up. The guy's very famous. I mean, very he's big time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=237.0s)]
*  And I said, oh, yeah, sure, Jeff, I'll look into that for you while I'm in Brazil. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=242.0s)]
*  And just to be nice. Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=246.0s)]
*  But in the back of my mind, I was like, I'm not wasting one second on that stupid case. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=248.0s)]
*  Seriously, I'm telling you the honest to God truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=253.0s)]
*  And it was 2011. So I go to Brazil with the intent with no intention of looking into it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=256.0s)]
*  Zero. OK. I wasn't even going to ask one question. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=262.0s)]
*  And it just so happens that nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=266.0s)]
*  And he's just a great guy. He's a man of interest and peace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=271.0s)]
*  And he's there at the conference and somehow the case gets brought up. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=275.0s)]
*  It wasn't about that case, but it gets brought up and he's like, oh, yeah, I was in Brazil. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=279.0s)]
*  When I went down and he's one of the smarter guys. Stanton Friedman. Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=283.0s)]
*  He is not an idiot. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=287.0s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the reasons why him and Don Schmidt and Kevin Randall. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=288.0s)]
*  One of the reasons why we're even talking about Roswell. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=292.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh, yeah, I was here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=295.0s)]
*  So then that kind of piqued my interest. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=298.0s)]
*  I was like, Oh, okay. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=300.34s)]
*  Well, God's dent and I can't completely dismiss come from Stanton. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=302.06s)]
*  Then I met a couple of people at the conference. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=305.26s)]
*  So I thought, okay, well, I piqued my interest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=308.52s)]
*  I got to be honest with you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=312.28s)]
*  And that's how it all started. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=313.62s)]
*  And that was like in 2011 and I was going to include a segment of it in the phenomenon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=315.9s)]
*  The interview at Stanton is that, did you get that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=322.5s)]
*  I got that in 2013 in Brazil. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=325.7s)]
*  Because he died when? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=328.12s)]
*  He died like a couple of years ago. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=329.5s)]
*  He died in the airport. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=330.82s)]
*  You know, he told me he's like, James, I'm retiring. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=331.8s)]
*  I can't do this anymore. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=336.0s)]
*  I live in Canada in this remote spot. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=337.0s)]
*  There are no direct flights and I'm always running in the airports trying to get my [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=338.6s)]
*  connecting flight and I just, I can't do it anymore. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=341.52s)]
*  And then he retired for like a year or so. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=344.64s)]
*  And then he just, he had to get back at it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=346.9s)]
*  And he died in the airport running for a connecting flight. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=348.72s)]
*  Oh, he had a heart attack. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=351.4s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=352.92s)]
*  That's exactly what he predicted. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=354.7s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=356.02s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=357.02s)]
*  And I just like... [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=358.62s)]
*  He was a fascinating guy because he was an outspoken critic of Lazar. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=359.62s)]
*  And I always wanted to get the two of them together. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=363.46s)]
*  I was like, I wanted to see. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  Because one of the things that the critics of Lazar always bring up is his education [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=367.38s)]
*  at MIT. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  I can explain that to you off air in the way that he explained it to me and it might make [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=375.18s)]
*  sense. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=380.1s)]
*  But I think that it's hard to dismiss that he worked at that lab. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=381.36s)]
*  Los Alamos Labs had him on their list of people that worked there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=386.68s)]
*  Like he was on the, whatever that thing is that they have with all the list of employees. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=391.88s)]
*  He was in it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=396.8s)]
*  Like he worked there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=397.8s)]
*  He knew all the people that worked there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=398.8s)]
*  He knew how it was set up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=400.16s)]
*  When they took him there, he knew the security guys. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=401.6s)]
*  He knew the machines that they used. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=404.88s)]
*  They had some sort of a scanner that measured the length of your digits exactly. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=408.14s)]
*  So you put your hand on this thing and he talked about it and everyone's like, what? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=413.86s)]
*  That doesn't even exist. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=418.66s)]
*  And then years later, people got photographs of this thing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=419.86s)]
*  George Knapp said he went through that Los Alamos laboratory like just right through. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=422.18s)]
*  Let me tell you, this is something that just came in yesterday that I can, for the first [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=427.46s)]
*  time ever, talk about in full detail. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=433.5s)]
*  I've talked about, I did a couple of podcasts where I gave, I don't know, in 1993, 94, I [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  was working on my first film. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=444.28s)]
*  I talked about it earlier. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=445.76s)]
*  It's called UFOs. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  It's so 90s, but whatever. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  UFOs, 50 years of denial. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=450.64s)]
*  It's like 80 years of denial now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=452.44s)]
*  And I was interviewing this guy out at Area 50. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=454.76s)]
*  He was like, lived on the outskirts of the base in a place called near the Little Alien [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=457.24s)]
*  in Rachel, Nevada. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=464.34s)]
*  And this guy's name is Chuck Clark. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=466.34s)]
*  And he had found all these, and the relevance of what I'm telling you will come to light [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=468.56s)]
*  in a second here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=472.58s)]
*  He'd found all these vantage points on the mountaintops that he could spy on the base [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=473.58s)]
*  down below with high powered telescopes with cameras. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=477.86s)]
*  And he was taking photographs of exotic airplanes coming out of hangars and stuff like that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=481.78s)]
*  He wrote a book called UFO Area 51 Handbook and Guide or something. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=486.46s)]
*  He was an amateur astronomer. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=493.2s)]
*  He was, and he had a couple of really cool sightings out at Area 51 that were really, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  like he saw these, it's in my movie, he saw these lights doing things that they shouldn't [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  be doing, right? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=504.86s)]
*  Like traversing and then stopping and then taking off really fast. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=506.26s)]
*  So anyway, so I'm covering his story because I was intrigued. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=509.94s)]
*  I mean, in the early 90s, the Bob Lazar thing was everywhere. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=512.86s)]
*  I was making a doc on UFOs. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=516.14s)]
*  So I was kind of looking into it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=517.62s)]
*  I wouldn't just like category could believe it, but I'll look into it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=518.98s)]
*  So I was looking into it and I'm going back and forth out there for many times. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=522.16s)]
*  And then one day I get a phone call from Chuck Clark and I'm back at home in Northern California [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=528.28s)]
*  and this is kind of a long way away. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=534.84s)]
*  And he goes, James, I got something you need to see. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=536.12s)]
*  I said, okay, well, what is it? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=540.48s)]
*  I can't tell you, but your jaw is going to hit the floor when you see it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=542.8s)]
*  I was like, that good? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=546.96s)]
*  He goes, oh yeah, that good. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=547.96s)]
*  I said, I'm canceling all my plans, jumped in my car and I drove straight through to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  Rachel, Nevada. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  I get to his house. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=554.9799999999999s)]
*  This must have been, I'm going to guesstimate 95, 94, 95. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=557.3s)]
*  Get to his house and he's got a double wide right near the little alien. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=562.3s)]
*  And he pops in this VHS tape. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  And it was like two guys on the quintessential road trip just to area, the surrounding areas, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=569.74s)]
*  the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=579.26s)]
*  typical road trip out to area 51. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  Blair Witch Project. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  Totally. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  And then they're goofing off next to the photographs of the alien in the crash disk. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  And then they're inside the little alien and I'm like, okay, where's this going? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=594.4s)]
*  And all of a sudden, and I saw this with my own eyes, all of a sudden the car is parked [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=599.08s)]
*  and it's parked out by the black mailbox in the desert and it's dusk. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=604.28s)]
*  The camera is on the armrest between the two seats and it's slightly cocked, like it's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  like, it's not level. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=616.74s)]
*  And it's filming the dashboard and the screen, the windscreen, windshield. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=619.04s)]
*  And there's two guys in there sounding like, you can't see them, sounding like they're [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=626.5s)]
*  trying to crawl under the seats. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=631.62s)]
*  I mean, they're freaking out. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  And then one of them goes, it's over the top of us. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, damn, what is this video? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=638.84s)]
*  Like, what am I, you know, then all of a sudden the car lights up on the inside, but the source [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=641.92s)]
*  of light is above it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=647.88s)]
*  Like if you can imagine, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=650.56s)]
*  If you could put a pendulum with a light source above a vehicle, like above the car, like [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=654.26s)]
*  this, but very slow and fluid motion, like rocking back and forth, the shadows and the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=659.64s)]
*  lights on the inside of the car are doing this really eerily. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  You've never seen anything like it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=669.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm looking like, my God, what is going on? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=670.0999999999999s)]
*  And they're very scared. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=672.9799999999999s)]
*  And one kid who's the younger of the two, it's like, I'm getting out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=674.62s)]
*  I'm getting out of the car. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=678.5s)]
*  I'm staying in the car. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=679.5s)]
*  It's over the top. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=680.5s)]
*  I'm staying in the fucking car. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=681.5s)]
*  He goes, no, I'm getting out. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=682.5s)]
*  And he gets out and he videotapes a disc that was so low you could have hit it with a rock. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=683.5s)]
*  And I'm looking at this thing and I'm like, that's what all the witnesses have tried to [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=693.96s)]
*  describe. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=701.2s)]
*  If you could imagine the skin on the craft glowing like phosphorus on a beach, that's [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  what it looked like. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=712.12s)]
*  The skin was alive and it had like a yellowy orange color to it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=713.12s)]
*  But you could clearly see it was a disc. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  It was not an orb. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=721.7600000000001s)]
*  It was a disc. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=723.08s)]
*  But the metal lit up like it was alive. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=724.38s)]
*  I'd never seen anything like it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=726.9000000000001s)]
*  And it just wobbled like it was unstable, like doing this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=728.86s)]
*  And the camera guy goes, oh my God. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=735.26s)]
*  And then something about the batteries and then boom, it shuts off. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=738.7s)]
*  I looked over at Chuck Clark. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=744.38s)]
*  I said, this is the video everyone's been waiting for. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=745.62s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=749.98s)]
*  How do you know this is real? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  All my BS meters are going off right now. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=753.96s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=757.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=758.36s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=759.36s)]
*  I saw this video with my own eyes. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=760.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=761.36s)]
*  It's a video though. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=762.36s)]
*  It's a video for sure. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=763.36s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=764.36s)]
*  And you know they make fake videos. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=765.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=766.36s)]
*  It was 1995 and they could have. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=767.36s)]
*  But why wouldn't... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=768.36s)]
*  1995 is harder. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=769.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=770.36s)]
*  But why? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=771.36s)]
*  It's never been released to the public. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=772.36s)]
*  Why would you create a fake video? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=773.56s)]
*  What year did you see it? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=775.6s)]
*  I saw it like 95. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=776.6s)]
*  And so it's out there somewhere. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=778.4s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=779.4s)]
*  Chuck Clark's got a copy of it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=780.78s)]
*  The story continues. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=782.78s)]
*  No, but I mean someone has it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=783.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=785.78s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=786.78s)]
*  I mean, in fact, if those two boys that shot it are out there, please come forward. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=787.78s)]
*  Like please. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=792.74s)]
*  How come no one's acquired this? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=793.74s)]
*  So I said to Chuck, oh my God, this is great. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  I can use this in my movie. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=799.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=801.9s)]
*  Great. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=802.9s)]
*  He goes, oh no. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=803.9s)]
*  No, no, they're terrible. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=804.9s)]
*  I said, well look, just put me in touch with the guys. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=805.9s)]
*  You don't have to like give... [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=808.22s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=810.4s)]
*  They're terrified, but they give it to a guy who lives in a trailer? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=811.4s)]
*  Hey, I'm just telling you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=813.4s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  Hey, I'm really terrified. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't want this getting out, but I'm going to give it to you. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  I get it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  Guy who lives in a trailer. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  I get it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  What does this guy do for a living? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  He was a former military guy and he's retired. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=823.48s)]
*  But sit with me for a minute. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=826.28s)]
*  Just a retired military guy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=827.28s)]
*  This guy's a fed. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=828.28s)]
*  He doesn't even live there. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=829.28s)]
*  He probably put on some fucking overalls to hang out with you. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=831.28s)]
*  The story gets better. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=835.12s)]
*  Is his name Ray Epps? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=836.12s)]
*  I know, Joe. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=837.12s)]
*  Believe me, I get it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=838.12s)]
*  The story gets better. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=840.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, sit tight. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=841.4599999999999s)]
*  Because I went on a couple of podcasts and I said, screw it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=842.4599999999999s)]
*  I don't care anymore. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=845.18s)]
*  I saw this video. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=846.18s)]
*  I'm going to start talking about it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=847.18s)]
*  Chuck Clark said, if you ask me again after like 10 years or 12 years, I'm never talking [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=848.18s)]
*  to you again. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=852.02s)]
*  So I was like, I of course asked him again. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=853.02s)]
*  I said, I'll give you 30 grand for the video. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=854.9799999999999s)]
*  He's not talking to me. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=856.9s)]
*  So I went on like concrete podcasts and I went on this guy, Julian Dorian's podcast and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=857.9s)]
*  I went on a bunch of other podcasts and I gave the whole story. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=864.06s)]
*  Let's let somebody else pick up the ball and run with it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=866.62s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I saw. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=869.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=870.36s)]
*  I get contacted a couple of years ago by a guy who goes, I saw that video too. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=873.32s)]
*  Then another guy contacts me and he goes, I'm a private investigator. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=879.84s)]
*  I find people. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=884.0s)]
*  I said, well, his name's Chuck Clark. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=885.0s)]
*  Go to it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=887.32s)]
*  So he finds him. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=888.32s)]
*  Right at that time, I'm going on the Impulsive Podcast with Logan Paul and I tell Logan Paul [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=890.0400000000001s)]
*  the story and he has exactly the same response you have and I don't blame you. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=896.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=900.98s)]
*  I'm not here to convince anybody of anything. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=901.98s)]
*  I'm just telling you what I saw. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=903.3s)]
*  It was very impressive what I saw. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=905.3s)]
*  Very impressive. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=908.32s)]
*  If it was a fake, my God, that was well done. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=909.38s)]
*  I mean, you should be making movies with Spielberg. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=912.26s)]
*  So anyway. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=915.38s)]
*  What is this channel's name? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=916.38s)]
*  Who has this again? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=917.38s)]
*  Chuck Clark. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=918.38s)]
*  Chuck, what are you doing? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=919.38s)]
*  Well, let me finish. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=920.38s)]
*  So Logan Paul, he's like, I want to go to this guy's house. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=922.1s)]
*  I got the guy. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=927.72s)]
*  He's got the information. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=928.72s)]
*  Logan's like, this is all behind the scenes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=929.72s)]
*  So Logan Paul takes, I put him in touch with this guy and this guy lives in the middle [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=932.2s)]
*  of nowhere. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=938.92s)]
*  I mean, it was like Logan Paul takes a Mercedes with a bunch of guys and a hundred thousand [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=939.92s)]
*  dollars in cash, a big brick, and he goes out to this guy's house in the middle of the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=943.8s)]
*  desert. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=949.24s)]
*  Logan calls me in the middle of nowhere. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=950.24s)]
*  He's like, you sure your contacts legit, dude? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=951.24s)]
*  My phone doesn't work. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=953.32s)]
*  I'm in the middle of nowhere. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=954.32s)]
*  I got a hundred k cash in my pocket. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=955.34s)]
*  I can't find this guy. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=957.2600000000001s)]
*  I said, no, I'm sure he's good, you know? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=958.74s)]
*  And so Logan goes in there and meets Chuck Clark and Chuck Clark's like, yeah, I got [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  the tape right here. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=966.6600000000001s)]
*  And so he says, I'll give you a hundred grand for it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=968.46s)]
*  And the guy says, no way. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=971.0200000000001s)]
*  And so Logan Paul is the reveal this for the first time. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=972.7800000000001s)]
*  Logan Paul has got a button camera on his dress, on his clothes. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=978.28s)]
*  So Logan Paul's like, all right, well, this guy doesn't want to, you know, he's going [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=985.64s)]
*  to die with it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=989.0s)]
*  So let's get, you know, let's get this thing on camera. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=990.04s)]
*  So Logan's like, well, let me see it at least. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=992.3599999999999s)]
*  So Logan like looks at it with this thing and, oh, could you show it to me again? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=995.4s)]
*  Gets another angle, gets another angle and then he leaves. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=999.04s)]
*  So Logan's like, I don't know if I want to go public. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1004.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't really own the video. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1007.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1010.24s)]
*  It seems like a bit of a gray zone. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1011.24s)]
*  So I said, look, you know, this is a story that might be of interest to Bob Lazar because [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1013.4000000000001s)]
*  maybe Bob Lazar should see this video and he could make a determination. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1019.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1023.0s)]
*  Or maybe George Knapp or Jeremy Corbell might be interested. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1024.1200000000001s)]
*  This is not my domain. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not a Bob Lazar big guy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1029.56s)]
*  I don't know a muff about Bob. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1032.16s)]
*  I met Bob Lazar in the early 90s and he told me, I came up to him at a conference and I [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1034.1s)]
*  said, hey, thank you for coming forward. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1038.54s)]
*  And he said, I didn't have a choice. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1041.98s)]
*  That was my only, I don't know anything about the case. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1044.34s)]
*  I know, you know way more than I do about the case, but I'm just saying, I'm just putting [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1046.26s)]
*  this out there. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1049.4399999999998s)]
*  How do I know more about the case than you? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1050.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, I literally make documentaries. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1052.5s)]
*  I do, but I, I mean, you got one person's account and it's fascinating. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1054.9399999999998s)]
*  And I believe that Lazar believes what he's saying. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1060.58s)]
*  But I've talked to George Knapp about this and George said the same thing. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  I said, maybe, I mean, just maybe. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1067.72s)]
*  And I'm not out here attacking Lazar or Corbell, nobody else. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1070.12s)]
*  I'm just saying maybe he was used as a disinformation plant that sees some real information and [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1073.0s)]
*  some bogus information just to kind of test the waters and the reaction of the public. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1079.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1082.6s)]
*  Most certainly that's possible. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yeah, I really. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1085.0s)]
*  Most certainly that's possible. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1086.0s)]
*  It's not my domain. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1087.0s)]
*  It's also, I would imagine if you're going to give people access to classified information [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1088.42s)]
*  like that, you'd be very careful and you would probably add in some stuff that's not true. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1092.14s)]
*  So it doesn't matter whether or not, as long as like they have a bunch of stuff that's [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1099.74s)]
*  absolutely provable nonsense on top of the stuff that's probably real, then they get [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1103.3s)]
*  discredited. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1109.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1110.3s)]
*  Which, you know, I mean, look, there's a lot of weird stuff about the Bob Lazar story, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1111.3s)]
*  a lot of weird stuff about it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1116.76s)]
*  And the one that sticks in my mind, and I know this probably shouldn't because it's [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1118.92s)]
*  possible to do, is that it's been consistent. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1123.96s)]
*  His story has been absolutely consistent since the late 1980s. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1126.56s)]
*  Now that's possible to develop a narrative. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1130.32s)]
*  And if your discipline is obviously very intelligent, you could just like craft the longest con [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1133.08s)]
*  the world has ever known and make no money from it and turn your life upside down and [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1138.1200000000001s)]
*  have the feds search your property, which they did. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1142.2s)]
*  It doesn't make a lot of sense. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1145.8200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make a lot of sense. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1146.8200000000002s)]
*  If they thought that he really was in possession of element 115 and that there really is a [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1148.38s)]
*  stable version of this element that we discovered in a particle collider, or we accurately, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1154.8600000000001s)]
*  they predicted it and then proved it to be real in a particle collider. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1163.3s)]
*  But that wasn't until like the 2000s. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1167.0600000000002s)]
*  When was it like when they, I want to say, was it like 2011 when they officially discovered [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1169.42s)]
*  particle 115 or element 115? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1176.5600000000002s)]
*  But this element, he said, was stable wherever these beings are from, and they use it to [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1179.72s)]
*  propel their craft through a means of bypassing normal propulsion systems with some insanely [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1186.4s)]
*  sophisticated method where they can pick points in space and they essentially just [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1193.8s)]
*  instantaneously traverse these points in space. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1199.82s)]
*  I brought a photograph with me. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1202.22s)]
*  Of course, I left it in the other room, but I'll bring it out at some point. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1204.98s)]
*  And it was a guy named James Kibble. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1208.94s)]
*  He's Australian. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1211.94s)]
*  And it's about 19, it's April 1966. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1212.94s)]
*  And the reason why I'm bringing this up is because I did a segment on a landing case [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1217.42s)]
*  that happened at Westall in 1966, which is a suburb, Westall Primary School, which is [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1224.28s)]
*  the suburb of Melbourne. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1229.48s)]
*  Shane Ryan did a film on it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1231.76s)]
*  I just covered a section of it in the phenomenon. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1232.96s)]
*  And during my time in Australia, I'd heard about this guy, James Kibble, that shot a [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1237.0800000000002s)]
*  a polaroid of a disc a couple of kilometers away, two days prior to the landing at the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1241.52s)]
*  school. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1247.58s)]
*  A lot of times when you have mass sightings like that, they're in and around the area [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1248.58s)]
*  for several days. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1252.18s)]
*  So it's very likely that those two are connected. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1253.5s)]
*  My point is this. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1255.58s)]
*  According to James Kibble, and he's in the film, he said the disc was coming down like [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1257.1399999999999s)]
*  this over his garden, and he had his polaroid camera he was going to take pictures of. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1262.5s)]
*  Were you doing the same wobbling kind of motion with your hands? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he said this kind of, I'm just telling you what he told me, yeah. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1269.26s)]
*  He said it was kind of wobbling down like a leaf, kind of. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1270.7199999999998s)]
*  And then he was like, holy shit, and he grabbed his polaroid camera and he said he did it [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1273.84s)]
*  so quickly he smashed it in his face and he split his nose open, but he snapped one shot [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1279.6399999999999s)]
*  and said what it did was, is it went like this, which I had the photograph that I have [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1284.4399999999998s)]
*  shows it sideways. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1289.9599999999998s)]
*  And I'll show it to you. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1290.9599999999998s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1291.9599999999998s)]
*  I scanned it from the original polaroid and then it shot off at an unbelievable rate of [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1292.9599999999998s)]
*  speed. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1297.7199999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to show it to him. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1298.82s)]
*  Exactly how Lazar describes how these things work. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1299.82s)]
*  That's exactly my point. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1302.34s)]
*  And when I interviewed all the children, now adults, that watched this thing land at this [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1303.34s)]
*  Westall Primary School in 1966, they said the same thing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1309.3s)]
*  It was sitting on the ground, they got up to I think about 10 feet away from it, which [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1313.42s)]
*  is pretty remarkable. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1316.6200000000001s)]
*  When you talk to witnesses, especially that many witnesses, I mean, there were roughly [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1317.82s)]
*  300 kids, I didn't meet all 300 of them, in the playground when this happened, and including [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1322.82s)]
*  the science teacher, this guy Greenwood, which I got him on camera for the first time in [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1327.0s)]
*  history in the phenomenon. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  And they said it got off the ground and then it went like this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1332.76s)]
*  It turned like this. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  It turned sideways again. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  And then it shot off at a high rate of speed. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1339.1599999999999s)]
*  It's in the mood. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1340.84s)]
*  You can hear all the testimony. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1341.84s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1342.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1343.84s)]
*  And I got a photograph of it like this. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1344.84s)]
*  And no sound. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1345.84s)]
*  And no sound. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1346.84s)]
*  A slight humming or buzzing sound. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1347.84s)]
*  This is 1966. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1349.32s)]
*  So I'm going to get to this later. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1350.9599999999998s)]
*  We can go back to the moment of contact. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1353.7s)]
*  But I'm going to make the argument that some, and I cannot emphasize how many times we need [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1354.7s)]
*  to underline the word some, UFOs, UAP, originate from a non-human intelligence. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1362.7s)]
*  And I'll start off in 45 and it'll take us up to modern day. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1369.74s)]
*  This is a handful of cases that I have personally investigated. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1374.58s)]
*  I have personally met the witnesses, gone to their houses, dating back to 45, 47, 52, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1379.44s)]
*  57, 55, 60s, 64, like all these cases. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1386.04s)]
*  So basically what I'm going to do is we all know, we know that the vast majority of these [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1391.16s)]
*  cases can be explained in conventional terms. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1396.72s)]
*  All this noise about Chinese balloons and weather balloons and that's all noise. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1401.4s)]
*  It's obfuscation and noise. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1407.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we know that all this stuff exists. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1409.18s)]
*  But what about the core five or 10 percent of cases? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1411.26s)]
*  And I'm going to give you some samples today that truly after extensive and exhaustive [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1414.98s)]
*  investigation, not because of a lack of data that defy a conventional explanation. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1420.26s)]
*  And those are the cases that I'll share with you today when we're ready. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1426.66s)]
*  But we can go back to moment of contact if you want. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1430.02s)]
*  Let's go right into it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1431.66s)]
*  You want to go right into it? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1432.46s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1433.0600000000002s)]
*  You got me so pumped up. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1435.0600000000002s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1435.74s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1436.26s)]
*  Oh, you got it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1437.46s)]
*  That's the photo. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1438.1000000000001s)]
*  That's the photo. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1438.86s)]
*  I got a much better copy outside, but see the way it turned sideways. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, let me tell you, if you ever see a photograph of the UFO and I've talked to NASA [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1443.08s)]
*  analysis about this and it has a clearly defined edge, it's probably a fake. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1447.36s)]
*  They somehow they have something to do with it's blurred around the edges. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1452.9199999999998s)]
*  They don't get, they can't get a crisp photograph of a photograph. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  They think it has something to do with the propulsion. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1460.9599999999998s)]
*  But again, that's not me saying this. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1463.04s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1464.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1465.4399999999998s)]
*  If there's some sort of a field around it. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1465.8s)]
*  I have a much better copy outside, but yeah, this is gives you an example. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1467.64s)]
*  You have a much better copy than this. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1470.8200000000002s)]
*  I do. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1472.1000000000001s)]
*  I scanned it from the original. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1472.3000000000002s)]
*  It's in my bag. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1473.26s)]
*  Go get the bag. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1474.18s)]
*  Should I go get it? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1475.0200000000002s)]
*  Go get the bag. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1475.5800000000002s)]
*  I'll go get it right now. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1476.1000000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1477.46s)]
*  Get the bag, man. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1477.74s)]
*  Oh, it's right there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1480.38s)]
*  Exciting. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1481.22s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1482.14s)]
*  Keep that up on the screen, please, Jamie. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1482.8200000000002s)]
*  Can I see the full, the full how it's. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1485.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1488.0200000000002s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1488.42s)]
*  It's oddly centered. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1488.66s)]
*  This is sent to me. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1489.94s)]
*  This is sent to me by the guy who shot the Polaroid. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1491.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1494.46s)]
*  There was his handwriting. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1494.94s)]
*  This came from Australia. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1495.9s)]
*  Boom. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1497.8200000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1498.9s)]
*  Check it out and see the way it sideways like that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1500.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1503.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to put on my old man glass. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1506.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1507.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1507.8200000000002s)]
*  I got mine too. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1508.0600000000002s)]
*  And we can get into, we can get into my argument that I'm going to put forth as [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1511.66s)]
*  if I'm presenting a case to a jury. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1517.94s)]
*  See my, my number one problem always with these things is that I want it to be true [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1520.5800000000002s)]
*  so bad that I worry that my rational, logical mind ignores all the possibilities of it [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1525.68s)]
*  being bullshit. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1534.72s)]
*  Don't look at any one particular case. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  What you have to do. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1537.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm looking at it like this, this photo. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1538.2s)]
*  Does that? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1539.92s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1540.68s)]
*  That's the same one. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1541.3200000000002s)]
*  That's the same photo. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1542.0s)]
*  So you got to look at it like that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1542.88s)]
*  Do it again. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1545.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1546.52s)]
*  Feel similar, bro. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1548.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1549.2s)]
*  It's a bell. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1549.8000000000002s)]
*  It's a school bell. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1550.68s)]
*  Time's up. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1551.4s)]
*  It's just, that's what there's some, that's what it tells us. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1551.88s)]
*  So up humans, which you can't base this stuff on any one James. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1554.8600000000001s)]
*  He proved it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1560.38s)]
*  It's over. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1561.18s)]
*  You can't make up Jamie James on the case. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1561.9s)]
*  Hey, all I could take, all I could say is that you talk to the witnesses. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1564.74s)]
*  I think if you picked it up, there's a hamburger underneath it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1569.8200000000002s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1572.9s)]
*  It's like a fancy restaurant hamburger. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1573.46s)]
*  Miss you, sir. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  Miss you. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1576.9s)]
*  It is. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1577.5s)]
*  Wap da theme. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1577.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, the kind where they don't put the bun together. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1579.38s)]
*  You got to do it together yourself. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1581.98s)]

*  But I also think, God, if you wanted to get someone that you could easily discredit, if [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1782.18s)]
*  you had a propulsion system that was baffling you and you had some wizard who likes to make [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1786.6200000000001s)]

*  He's clearly brilliant. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1800.5s)]
*  He listened to the guy talk. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1802.14s)]

*  Let's, let's have that guy go down there. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1807.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, this guy's out there in the fucking desert shooting AK-47s and shit. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1809.76s)]

*  Right. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1814.28s)]
*  So you bring that guy and you tell him, hey, tell us what this is. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1815.2s)]
*  Go to work. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1821.5600000000002s)]

*  We got to bring in other perspectives and you got to bring in someone that's not going [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1843.14s)]
*  to be able to communicate with other scientists. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1849.0800000000002s)]
*  This is part of the problem. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1850.7s)]
*  You can't share data. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1851.94s)]
*  They can't, they can't peer review with other scientists all over the world because it's [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1853.38s)]
*  top secret shit. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1857.26s)]
*  So everything has to stay within this small group, very small group of people and none [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1858.5s)]

*  So you keep funneling new people in. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1866.68s)]
*  They do experiments. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1868.52s)]
*  Something blows up. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1869.56s)]
*  Some people die. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1870.68s)]
*  And you're like, okay, let's try some more. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1872.32s)]
*  What else you got? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1874.8s)]
*  I only got this guy at Los Alamos lab. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1875.72s)]
*  He puts fucking rocket engines in the back some fondas and he's a propulsion's expert. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1877.2s)]
*  He's kind of nuts, but maybe bring in men. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1881.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1884.8s)]
*  So, uh, I'll get back to my domain because I, this is the stuff that I know. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1885.04s)]
*  And I know primarily cause I went and interviewed the witnesses. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1889.48s)]
*  I just went off on a tangent. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1891.92s)]
*  You know, it's all good. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1892.68s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going to Bobble's our day. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1893.58s)]
*  I just don't know the case well enough to comment on it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1896.42s)]
*  I mean, more than that. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1898.8600000000001s)]
*  The reason why I shared that, that video story is not because I'm sitting there [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1899.78s)]
*  telling you that's definitive piece of evidence that the world's been waiting [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1903.22s)]
*  for, but it's very compelling. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1906.14s)]
*  It's never been released and I'm giving you guys a lead on that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1908.06s)]
*  This guy has it. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1912.3s)]
*  Logan Paul. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1913.78s)]
*  So Logan Paul just put it out on your broadcast. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1914.38s)]
*  He might do that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1916.42s)]
*  So anyway, if the guy sues you, the money that you'd make from having that and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1917.1s)]
*  releasing it would probably be way worth it. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1921.26s)]
*  You know, and I hope if, if, if the two guys that shot it, one was 19, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1923.6399999999999s)]
*  the other guy was close to 30. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1928.0s)]
*  So those guys are still alive. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1929.36s)]
*  They lived in Los Angeles and they're definitely still alive. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1930.8s)]
*  Yeah. They should be. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1933.3999999999999s)]
*  Those guys are still alive. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1933.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's put together a documentary. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1935.1599999999999s)]
*  Contact. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1937.36s)]
*  Well, I'd like to see the original tape because it's going to be a lot better [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1937.9199999999998s)]
*  condition than an old VHS tape. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1940.72s)]
*  Tell these gentlemen, I'll get you on the podcast. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1942.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1944.2s)]
*  So tell the story. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  Contact me at James C Fox. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1945.8s)]
*  Oh, don't put your email. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  What are you crazy? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1949.84s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1950.76s)]
*  Delete that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1951.24s)]
*  That was my Twitter. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1952.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1953.22s)]
*  Just my Twitter. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1953.94s)]
*  I thought you were going to give your email out. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1955.22s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1956.78s)]
*  Good Lord. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1957.54s)]
*  Sir. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1958.34s)]
*  No, I made a mistake in doing that one time on Larry King live. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1958.78s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1961.8999999999999s)]
*  How many dick pics did you get? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1963.74s)]
*  Any? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1965.78s)]
*  I was so inundated. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1967.82s)]
*  I could not believe I was like, what was I thinking? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1969.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1973.26s)]
*  This is probably like millions of people watching this show. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1973.46s)]
*  Oh my Lord. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1974.7s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1976.1399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, the people about when it comes to UFOs, people are very passionate. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1976.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1980.34s)]
*  So let me get back to my argument because from 1945 forward. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1980.86s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1984.6s)]
*  Am I correct? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1985.7199999999998s)]
*  And this is one of the things that I've always heard is that after the bombs were [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1986.4399999999998s)]
*  dropped, that's when the UFO started showing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1989.84s)]
*  Well, that's when the activity certainly heightened. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1992.1999999999998s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1996.12s)]
*  So is there any indication that they were directly connected other than the fact [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  that they just show up? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2005.6s)]
*  Was there ever any testimony? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2007.18s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2010.78s)]
*  I'll tell you how it organically came upon my attention. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2011.26s)]
*  I was working with this guy, Lance Mungi. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2015.1s)]
*  I was one of the editors that was working on the phenomenon with me. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2016.42s)]
*  And we were doing this archive from a guy, this guy named David Marlowe. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2020.74s)]
*  It's got this incredible archive of UFO material dating right back to the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  forties, all the way to modern day. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2029.54s)]
*  Newspaper headlines, audio recordings, statements, broadcast. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2030.86s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2035.24s)]
*  The biggest archive you could spend the rest of your life in there. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2035.72s)]
*  So he gave me a bunch of stuff that was archive interviews of primarily people at [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2038.48s)]
*  White Sands, Holoman Air Force Base, different areas in Texas. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2044.1200000000001s)]
*  And I was just putting it in, it's kind of like a little montage in the piece of [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  just giving the illustration that these things are going on kind of all over. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2051.8s)]
*  And my buddy goes, Hey man, let's put a map on the wall and put pins in the map [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2055.96s)]
*  for all these different locations. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2059.84s)]
*  So I was like, Oh, okay, sure. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2061.36s)]
*  Let's do that. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2062.84s)]
*  So we put a map on the wall in the edit room when we were doing the phenomenon. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2063.28s)]
*  And we were putting pins in and we looked at each other after like a day or two. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2068.02s)]
*  We were like, look at proximity to Trinity site. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2071.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2075.26s)]
*  Even Socorro, White Sands, this place in Texas. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2076.1800000000003s)]
*  Like that's kind of unusual. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2079.5400000000004s)]
*  We're kind of scratching our heads. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2081.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you think there's a correlation? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2082.5s)]
*  So anyway, we didn't really take it much further than that, but we definitely took [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2084.34s)]
*  notice and then I met with Senator Harry Reid. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2088.1000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, George Knapp for helping make that happen. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2091.96s)]
*  Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who started the AATIP program. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2094.84s)]
*  And during the interview, I didn't think about asking them this, but at the end, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2098.1600000000003s)]
*  and he had like, I'll have 47 minutes with you and then I got to go. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2102.1600000000003s)]
*  And he's got all the security guards and big guys with earpieces looking at me. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2106.1200000000003s)]
*  I said, well, sir, would you mind if we could do a quick walk and talk? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2111.4s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I'll give you 45 seconds. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2116.52s)]
*  So I figured, well, while I'm walking with Senator Reid, I'm going to ask him, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2117.96s)]
*  what was one of the more astonishing aspects of the phenomenon that they [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2121.26s)]
*  uncovered during this Pentagon UFO program? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2124.1400000000003s)]
*  And right away, without hesitation, he goes, the fact that there are incursions [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2127.3s)]
*  over our nuclear missile facilities, nuclear armed facilities, that is of grave [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2131.5s)]
*  concern, just that was a shocking aspect of the phenomenon. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2138.2200000000003s)]
*  And I thought back to that math that we'd done in the edit room. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2141.38s)]
*  So I was like, I gotta, I gotta go back to the drawing board. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2144.46s)]
*  So I spent a year. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2146.96s)]
*  I contacted this guy named Robert Hastings, who's the guy who wrote the book [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2148.88s)]
*  on the connection between UFOs and nukes. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2152.88s)]
*  What is the book? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2155.32s)]
*  Uh, his name is Robert Hastings, um, um, UFOs and nukes, I think. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2156.36s)]
*  But in any case, I contacted him and he's like, Oh, I've, I'm not doing too well. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2161.1s)]
*  I got this heart condition. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2166.0s)]
*  I tell you what, you can have all my archives, all the videos that I shot. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2167.0s)]
*  So I went through all of it and I put together just like a five or 10 minute [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2170.2000000000003s)]
*  segment in the phenomenon, that connection. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2173.32s)]
*  And you've got all these like missile control launch officers and people at [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2176.5s)]
*  Malstrom Air Force Base, Minot Air Force Base talking about these incredible [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2180.06s)]
*  incursions and keep in mind, you're talking about people that we entrusted [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2184.1200000000003s)]
*  with the secure, like securement and, and, and deployment of nuclear weapons. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2188.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2194.7400000000002s)]
*  So if these guys are lying, that's a problem. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2195.38s)]
*  And if these guys are hallucinating when they've got nuclear weapons at their [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  disposal, that's terrifying and it's happening all over. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2204.04s)]
*  I mean, there is, I don't, I've got at least 15 or 20 of these guys testifying. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2207.5s)]
*  And Robert Hastings has got a bunch more. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2212.56s)]
*  My point is there is, there does seem to be a connection. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2214.4s)]
*  I interviewed this guy, Robert Salas. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2218.1000000000004s)]
*  Robert Salas was a Lieutenant Robert Salas, launch control officer, United [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2221.92s)]
*  States Air Force has this incredible encounter in, in Malstrom, his people do. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2225.46s)]
*  And UFO sighted a disc and then his nukes start shutting down. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2230.7000000000003s)]
*  He said to me, I'll never forget this. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2237.26s)]
*  And this is like 2002. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2239.18s)]
*  This is part of out of the blue. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2240.66s)]
*  He goes, well, James, very calm. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2242.3s)]

*  Let me give you another example. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2349.94s)]
*  Joint base, uh, Rendlesham forest, December, 1980. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2352.22s)]
*  It's a joint British U S base. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2358.46s)]
*  It's called the Reynolds Rendlesham forest incident. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2361.14s)]
*  There was a landing December, 1980. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2364.18s)]
*  You've got Jim Penniston, John Burroughs, and this guy, Ed Kabansack thinking [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2367.52s)]
*  that like something crashed in the forest or something, they went out to investigate [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2372.48s)]
*  and there's an object sitting on the forest floor. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2376.76s)]
*  It's a, it's a kind of like a triangular shaped object and it's dark. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2378.84s)]
*  It's warm to the touch. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2384.08s)]
*  And they sat with it on the ground. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2385.3s)]
*  Kabansack acts acted like as a relay between the base and where this [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  object is set on the ground. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2390.6s)]
*  Jim Penniston took photographs of it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2392.36s)]
*  He had his log book. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2393.9s)]
*  He wrote down the symbols that were on the craft, which are crazy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2395.5s)]
*  And, um, and then the deputy base commander, Colonel Charles Halt, I interviewed him. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2398.72s)]
*  He had, uh, cause sightings can happen over a period, uh, of a week or more. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2403.22s)]
*  A lot of times when you get these mass sightings and even the deputy base [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2409.1s)]
*  commander, Colonel Charles Halt became a witness, he was skeptical. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2412.74s)]
*  And then he too became a witness. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2415.66s)]
*  And he said that these objects, there's a recording of him while it's happening. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2417.14s)]
*  It's out there in the, in the ether. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2421.66s)]
*  There were shooting beams of light down in the weapon storage area. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2423.8s)]
*  That was December, 1980. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2426.6s)]
*  Um, phenomenal case, the Reynolds from forest incident. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2429.04s)]
*  These are like the cases. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2432.48s)]
*  What did this object look like? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2433.96s)]
*  It was a triangular shaped object, not that big. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2435.48s)]
*  I don't know, maybe six feet high and it was black. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2439.08s)]
*  And he said it was warm to the touch and it didn't make any sound, very little [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2441.2000000000003s)]
*  sound, and then it lifted off the forest floor, maneuvered up through the [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2444.54s)]
*  trees and shot off at a high rate of speed. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2447.94s)]
*  Now these are people that are responsible for the security of our nuclear weapons. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
*  Saying this, the deputy base commander, Colonel Charles Halt saying this, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2453.6800000000003s)]
*  Gordon Williams, the general of the entire base, I interviewed him as well. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2458.28s)]
*  He talks about how the fact that this got out, it was a memo that was written by [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2462.6s)]
*  deputy base commander, Colonel Charles Halt that leaked and the whole story got out. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2466.12s)]
*  But those are the cases that I'm talking about that represent that five or 10% [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2469.92s)]
*  core that, that cannot be explained away in conventional terms, defy [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2474.42s)]
*  after exhausted research. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2479.6s)]
*  I mean, Nick Pope talks about it at the MOD, he investigated it cause it took [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2481.14s)]
*  place in England. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2484.38s)]
*  He said there were radiation readings at the landing site. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2485.24s)]
*  Do these, the crafts that happened at the base, do they have [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2487.58s)]
*  photograph of these things? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2490.66s)]
*  Well, Jim Penison says that he took photographs and then they said the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2492.14s)]
*  photographs didn't come out. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2495.54s)]
*  That's what they told him. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2496.82s)]
*  So he took photographs to get developed and then when they developed them, they [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2499.22s)]
*  said, that's what they said to him. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2502.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2503.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2504.3s)]
*  So most likely they just said. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2504.54s)]
*  So then, and then, uh, one of the things that Colonel Charles Halt said that the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2506.74s)]
*  deputy base commander is that a plane came in and there was some unknown [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2510.82s)]
*  government, US agency. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2514.48s)]
*  I know you guys probably thinking I'm crazy now, but don't take it from me. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2515.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm just telling you what they told me. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2518.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2519.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2520.0s)]
*  That, that they came in and kind of sanitize the whole, the whole case, but [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  that's a very good case. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2524.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's one of the top cases that is extremely, it's been investigated in [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2525.9s)]
*  England, it's been investigated in the United States and all, a lot of the [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2530.56s)]
*  witnesses have come forward on the record. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2533.36s)]
*  So it's quite possible that somewhere in some archive this photo exists or [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2535.44s)]
*  some photos exist. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2540.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2542.1800000000003s)]
*  Let me. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  So, but here's the question. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2542.98s)]
*  If the, if the government keeps coming out and telling us that, you know, we [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2544.38s)]
*  may begin to face threats from outside of this world, if they're telling us that, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2549.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, like when they're discussing these things, they behave in a way that [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2554.38s)]
*  we can't described and no propulsion systems that we know of, they're telling [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2558.6200000000003s)]
*  us all this, why wouldn't they release all that other stuff too? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2562.38s)]
*  Why wouldn't they release those photographs? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2565.1400000000003s)]
*  What's in it for them? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2566.94s)]
*  Well, what's in it for them to tell us about it in the first place? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2568.3s)]
*  Well, they're not. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2571.0600000000004s)]
*  But what's in it for them to even admit? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2572.1000000000004s)]
*  What, I mean, just the way they're addressing it now. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2574.1400000000003s)]
*  People think that there was a sudden epiphany with the U S government that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2576.78s)]
*  they wanted to be more transparent and they wanted the general public to know [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2581.78s)]
*  more about this phenomenon. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2585.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2586.9s)]
*  That is not what happened. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2587.26s)]
*  What happened is a couple of insiders in December of, of, of, of 2017 walked [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2589.46s)]
*  some evidence out of a tip, found a loophole and put it on the front page of [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2596.6200000000003s)]
*  the New York times leakers. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2600.64s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2602.8199999999997s)]
*  It was leaker. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2603.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2603.8199999999997s)]
*  Did that? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2604.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2604.42s)]
*  It was Christopher Mellon. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2604.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2606.1s)]
*  I actually got a phone call when the film was coming out and I got a phone call [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2607.18s)]
*  from Leslie Kane and she goes, Christopher Mellon told you that he was the one [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2610.72s)]
*  that walked the footage out of the Pentagon. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2613.98s)]
*  I said, yeah, it's on camera. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, she goes, she goes, I can't believe that he didn't even want that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2617.7799999999997s)]
*  The New York times, like how, you know, I said, I don't know. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2621.7s)]
*  He just, he just said it and that's what happened. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2624.14s)]
*  It wasn't like suddenly the government had this epiphany. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2626.58s)]
*  So now they can't put the genie back in the bottle. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2629.22s)]
*  Now you've got the David Fravers, right? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2632.06s)]
*  David Fravers encounters phenomenal. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2634.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2636.54s)]
*  Come on. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2637.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2638.14s)]
*  I mean, it's got photographic evidence that tick tack. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2638.3799999999997s)]
*  I was investigating a landing case in Zucor, New Mexico. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2642.9399999999996s)]
*  It was April 24th, 1964. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2646.7799999999997s)]
*  So I spent five years on this case. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2650.14s)]
*  It was the case that turned around Dr. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2652.14s)]
*  Jalen Heineck. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2654.5s)]
*  Dr. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2656.06s)]
*  Jalen Heineck investigated UFO reports for the United States Air Force [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2656.36s)]
*  as a scientific advisor for from 47 to 69. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2659.42s)]
*  He's the one that coined all the term close encounter of the first kind, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2663.86s)]
*  close encounter the second time, the second kind, the close encounter [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2668.28s)]
*  of the third kind. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2671.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2672.42s)]
*  Close encounter of the first kind of when you see a UFO at close range, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2674.2200000000003s)]
*  close encounter the second time you see a UFO and somehow it interacts [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2677.34s)]
*  with the environment, whether like Richard Dreyfus face got burnt or it [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2680.7400000000002s)]
*  leaves marks on the ground or it burns trees or whatever. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2684.0s)]
*  The propulsion affects something close encounter of the third kind. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2687.76s)]
*  And this is coming out of Air Force project blue books, own files. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2690.72s)]
*  This is not me saying this close encounter of the third kind is when beans [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2693.56s)]
*  are reported by the witnesses. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2697.36s)]
*  So beans are associated with the craft are reported. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2699.4s)]
*  One of the best, most well-documented cases in U S history took place. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2702.76s)]
*  It's core New Mexico, April 24th, 1964 at five o'clock with a police officer [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2706.64s)]
*  that was on duty by the name of Lonnie Zamora. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2711.52s)]
*  The best case in U S history, the best documented case, the first military [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2714.32s)]
*  officer, uh, to arrive on the scene, got there, the bushes were still smoking. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2719.28s)]
*  I mean, the imprints and the ground of the craft, the footprints, they [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2724.52s)]
*  got diagrams of this stuff. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2727.64s)]
*  And I spent five years going back and forth to score New Mexico. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2729.6s)]
*  I got to know the wife, Mary, I got to know the daughter, Diane, the son, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2734.92s)]
*  Michael, his coworkers. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2739.16s)]
*  I went to the national archives with Ray Stanford. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2741.2s)]
*  He wrote the book on it. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2743.32s)]
*  It's coral saucer in a Pentagon pantry. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2744.54s)]
*  Phenomenal case. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2746.82s)]
*  And what I learned was that the, um, the air force, according to his own family, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2748.54s)]
*  Lonnie Zamora's family told his daughter this, I have this on camera. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2757.34s)]
*  The air force wanted him desperately not to talk about the beans. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2761.26s)]
*  Like do they discouraged him to talk about the beans. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2767.3s)]
*  And I tell you why it's one thing when you see an object, unknown object, like [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2770.14s)]
*  David Fravor saw up in the sky, exhibiting a technology that seems to [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2775.14s)]
*  defy conventional propulsion. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2779.5s)]
*  And it's another thing altogether when you've got beans on the ground. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2782.96s)]
*  Well, the air force didn't want him talking about that. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2786.7s)]
*  And that was one thing that his daughter and his wife told me clearly. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2788.68s)]
*  And his wife said what Lonnie was never the same after that, that case. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2791.54s)]
*  But so what did Lonnie see? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2796.62s)]
*  Lonnie saw two beans, the base of a, of an egg shaped craft that was landed in [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2798.66s)]
*  an Arroyo in Socorro, New Mexico in broad daylight. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2802.42s)]
*  Lonnie looked out the window of his patrol car. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2805.54s)]
*  He saw something that caught his eye. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2807.62s)]
*  And then this object landed. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2809.48s)]
*  He drove, he was actually in hot pursuit at the time. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2812.0s)]
*  He gave up pursuit to go investigate what was going on. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2814.42s)]
*  And he sees this object on the, on the, on the, in the Arroyo, in the desert, on [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2817.7s)]
*  the ground, it's such a well-documented case and he rolls down his car window and [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2821.7599999999998s)]
*  he's looking out and he's going to, am I looking at like a, an overturned car? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2826.52s)]
*  What the hell am I looking at? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2830.96s)]
*  And then he sees two little figures. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2832.74s)]
*  He said they were childlike at the base of the craft and one of them locked eyes [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2835.6s)]
*  with him and his wife said he was never the same after that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2839.12s)]
*  But, um, how did he describe them? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2843.28s)]
*  What they said they were childhood. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2845.52s)]
*  They were small, childlike, small and had white coveralls, tight coveralls. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2846.7599999999998s)]
*  This is a close encounter with the third kind. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2852.64s)]
*  What they say their faces look like. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2853.96s)]
*  I, he didn't give a lot of detail. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2855.48s)]
*  I've got the only, so I went to Lonnie's house. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2857.52s)]
*  I got to know his, his wife quite well. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2861.1600000000003s)]
*  Lonnie had passed a couple of years prior to that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2863.28s)]
*  And I, I don't know how far down the rabbit hole you want to go on this case [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2865.7200000000003s)]
*  because we could talk on this case for three hours, but whatever. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2869.52s)]
*  Um, I could tell you that I got access to, he had this black duffel bag and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2872.2400000000002s)]
*  it was with his wife's permission. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2876.32s)]
*  He had kept all the original news prints from the articles that had come out. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2878.76s)]
*  And that's where I got the details. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2882.96s)]
*  And he also talked about it in some recordings that I got from his [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2884.8799999999997s)]
*  family and other researchers. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2887.64s)]
*  It's in the movie, the phenomenon. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2889.2s)]
*  And, um, that's where I got the primary description because it was Richard T. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2891.0s)]
*  Holder was the first military officer on the scene. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2895.52s)]
*  The FBI got involved later and, and, uh, how long was that thing sitting out there for? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2897.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, the object was sitting on the ground, not for very long, just a few minutes. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2902.6s)]
*  Lonnie saw the beans and he went like around to get a closer look. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2906.08s)]
*  I mean, he was like, what the hell am I looking at? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2911.48s)]
*  And he, he drove his car around to get a closer look and he lost contact with [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2913.92s)]
*  for a second while he drove around to get a closer look. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2918.28s)]
*  Now he's within 50 feet of this egg thing sitting on the ground. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2920.92s)]
*  And he gets out of the patrol car. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2924.64s)]
*  It starts, uh, it starts making some weird noise and it has a blue flame that comes [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2926.96s)]
*  out and he said it wasn't, it was not like a, like a rocket flame where it would hit [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2934.0s)]
*  the ground and dust everything up, but it pierced the ground like a knife through [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2937.52s)]
*  warm butter. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2941.2400000000002s)]
*  And, and then when it got about 20 feet off the ground, it went completely silent [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2942.44s)]
*  with no flame, no nothing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2946.2400000000002s)]
*  You can hear a pin drop. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2948.1200000000003s)]
*  There was a symbol on the side of the craft. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2949.44s)]
*  It was in yellow and it was about three feet tall and it was a, like a V like this, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2951.76s)]
*  two lines and a line on top. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2955.6800000000003s)]
*  And, um, let's get a photo of that, uh, symbol that he recreated. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2957.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2961.04s)]
*  You'll see, you'll see, you'll see fake symbols because Richard T. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2961.2400000000002s)]
*  Holder asked him to draw a different symbol. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2965.0s)]
*  I actually have the original symbol, um, on a document from Dr. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2967.56s)]
*  Why did someone ask him to draw a fake symbol? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2971.84s)]
*  Because he said that if, if anybody else claimed to see the same craft with that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2974.04s)]
*  symbol, they would immediately be able to identify a hokester. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2977.52s)]
*  Oh, so which was the real one? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2980.56s)]
*  The real one is that one right there with the two lines in that upside down V [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2982.8s)]
*  right there. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2987.84s)]
*  That's the real one. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2988.2400000000002s)]
*  That's the real one. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2989.04s)]
*  I've got the document in Dr. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2989.8s)]
*  Jalen Heineck's own handwriting. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2991.28s)]
*  Ray Stanford and I went to the national archives and found it. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2993.4s)]
*  It was a huge find. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2996.0800000000004s)]
*  So they did that on purpose just in case some copycat people started coming up. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=2997.04s)]
*  He did Richard T. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3001.32s)]
*  Holder. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3002.0s)]
*  And I met Richard T. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3002.2799999999997s)]
*  Holder's two kids and talked to them about it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3003.08s)]
*  I talked to his wife about it and they said, yeah, he was, he was told that's [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3005.68s)]
*  not the genuine, that's the one right there, right there that you're looking at. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3009.4s)]
*  That's the real one. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3013.24s)]
*  No question. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3014.36s)]
*  So anyway, my point is that his handwritten note over there that shows it. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3015.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's, yeah, that's definitely, I've actually had, I actually found the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3019.44s)]
*  original one of those there. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3022.84s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3024.32s)]
*  That's the document that I found with Ray Stanford at the national archives in 2013. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3024.92s)]
*  This is in Dr. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3029.6400000000003s)]
*  Heineck's own handwriting. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3030.52s)]
*  In close to just any resemblance to the, and he draws this symbol of Socorro. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3032.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe we've, yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3037.36s)]
*  I mean, it was kind of a genius move, quite honestly. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3038.92s)]
*  So this was the case that turned J. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3041.88s)]
*  Allen Heineck? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3043.76s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3044.44s)]
*  So what happened was Jacques Follet was it right? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3044.88s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3048.1200000000003s)]
*  Similar. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3049.4s)]
*  So similar to a Tic Tac. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3050.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it looked like. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3052.52s)]
*  But when it got, when it got to about 20 feet off the ground, it went completely [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3053.36s)]
*  silent, no blue flame, nothing. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3056.8s)]
*  The landing gear was retracted. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3058.8s)]
*  It was just an egg and it floated off in the distance. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3060.52s)]
*  And actually Lonnie, I've got an, I've got an interview with Lonnie where he says [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3064.6400000000003s)]
*  that one of the officers who arrived on the scene actually saw it fly off, off in [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3067.6s)]
*  the distance and it was witnessed by other people in the town that saw this thing flying. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3072.96s)]
*  Didn't the Tic Tac, the people who saw the Tic Tac, including Commander [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3075.92s)]
*  Fravor, didn't he say that there was some sort of a thing that almost looked like [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3079.8s)]
*  landing gear? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3083.96s)]
*  No, there was something that protruded out in the front of it or something. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3084.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3087.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3088.48s)]
*  But the, but apparently the video, I think it was according to Fravor, the video is [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3089.0s)]
*  the one that's been out is a lot, the resolution is a lot worse than, than what [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3093.92s)]
*  other people had seen at the time. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3097.5600000000004s)]
*  I remember I think Pritzard David Fravor said that to me. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3099.0s)]
*  So, yeah, so I just, I, so I just recently went, I'm filming a new doc and I went to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3101.6400000000003s)]
*  Washington, D.C. for a month to get kind of caught up on what's been happening, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3107.6s)]
*  because a lot's been happening. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3111.08s)]
*  While I'm doing Moment of Contact, there's an unprecedented effort in Washington, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3112.48s)]
*  D.C. to push for further government transparency. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3118.36s)]
*  Marco Rubio, Senator Gillibrand, Andre Carson, Representative Andre Carson, who [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3122.2799999999997s)]
*  got the congressional hearings that happened last year, Gallego, Representative [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3128.2799999999997s)]
*  Gallego and Gallagher have all been involved in others. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3132.04s)]
*  And so I got introduced, some intelligence folks on the inside, and they wanted me to [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3134.88s)]
*  read this to your audience. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3139.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3140.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is about evidence. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3141.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3142.88s)]
*  So, and this was pretty much a reaction to the latest hearing that happened with [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3143.88s)]
*  Gillibrand just a couple of days ago or last week. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3150.4s)]
*  I will remain anonymous, but I've been monitoring the UFO and I met this guy. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3153.92s)]
*  I know this guy, this guy's legit. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3158.6400000000003s)]
*  The UFO, UAP activity and the authorities' response to them. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3160.96s)]
*  I can assure you there's a lot more evidence behind the curtain that hasn't been released. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3164.7200000000003s)]
*  First, our military are and have been seeing remarkable things in the sky, in the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3169.92s)]
*  oceans and on the land for years. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3175.48s)]
*  Of those reported, where does all this information get stored? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3177.84s)]
*  Authorities would have you believe that this data is destroyed, but unique data is [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3181.88s)]
*  stored somewhere to be reviewed later. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3185.96s)]
*  And as someone that is seeing the classified holdings, I am very disappointed in the fact [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3188.7999999999997s)]
*  that Dr. Kirkpatrick showed some of the most mundane videos to the public. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3193.64s)]
*  I do understand that there are security factors to be considered. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3198.4s)]
*  So I'm hoping that Senator Gillibrand saw something much more interesting in her [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3201.56s)]
*  closed door hearing with Kirkpatrick. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3205.56s)]
*  And why did only two senators show up for the hearing? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3207.84s)]
*  Have they lost faith in Kirkpatrick already? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3210.52s)]
*  I applaud Senator Gillibrand's efforts to find the truth, but I am more sure than [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3213.2799999999997s)]
*  ever that Kirkpatrick is not the one. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3217.76s)]
*  Interesting. So he's withholding some information. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3221.2000000000003s)]
*  These people went on camera for me. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3223.76s)]
*  It's going to be released when the time is right. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3225.1200000000003s)]
*  But I've got. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3227.44s)]
*  Yeah, again, it's one of those things conveniently like Lucy pulling the ball away [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3228.5600000000004s)]
*  from Charlie Brown. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3232.88s)]
*  It's so close. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3234.1600000000003s)]
*  It's so frustrating. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3235.88s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3238.1600000000003s)]
*  So frustrating. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3239.2000000000003s)]
*  Christopher Mellon said that there's very high resolution photographs. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3240.28s)]
*  So he now has a he just he just met with me in D.C. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3244.24s)]
*  and he's now told me that there is satellite data. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3248.0s)]
*  And the only reason why he talked about it is because Ratcliffe mentioned it. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3252.04s)]
*  So he's like, well, Ratcliffe mentioned it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3255.3599999999997s)]
*  So I'll mention the fact that Ratcliffe mentioned it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3256.56s)]
*  It's satellite data. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3258.72s)]
*  And I was like, well, how good are the photographs? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3260.0s)]
*  I want to know so bad. You know, me, like, come on, I've been looking at this for 30 [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3262.52s)]
*  years. Yeah. How good are the photographs? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3265.56s)]
*  He goes, James, 4K. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3267.52s)]
*  Just think about as good as you can imagine of craft and to know that. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3269.96s)]
*  And I spoke to five other people that are part of the program or had the top [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3274.04s)]
*  seat, the clearances, the access to this. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3278.92s)]
*  And they all confirmed. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's like they're just on the other side of that curtain. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3283.24s)]
*  Could like could somebody just get those out here, please, please. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3285.72s)]
*  Do you think we're closer than ever to those things being leaked? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3289.92s)]
*  I think that if we keep the pressure on, I think it's very important. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3292.84s)]
*  One of the things that concerns me a little bit is that sometimes they could leak [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3297.16s)]
*  something that looks amazing. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3301.12s)]
*  Right. And then you put your fingerprints all over it and you send it out with the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3303.6s)]
*  ether and then it's proven to get debunked. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3307.56s)]
*  Right. So you got to be kind of careful if you don't know provenance. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3310.3199999999997s)]
*  And so I would imagine they would do stuff like that on purpose. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3313.64s)]
*  Oh, these guys are so smart. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3316.4s)]
*  They're like five steps ahead of us. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3317.72s)]
*  You know, so but, you know, I know what I know, not because I read it out of a [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3319.48s)]
*  book, but I actually went into the field. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3323.6s)]
*  I mean, I travel. I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I was interviewing [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3326.4s)]
*  generals and cosmonauts in Russia back in the late 90s. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3329.88s)]
*  I went to China. I went to Australia. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3333.08s)]
*  I went to Africa. I went to Russia, as I was just saying, all across Europe. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3334.9199999999996s)]
*  I really want to know. Like, I'm so curious. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3340.16s)]
*  I like to go to location. I like to like to give an example. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3342.2799999999997s)]
*  I found out in China just a couple of years ago, there was a case that happened [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3346.8799999999997s)]
*  in 1994, the same time as Rua called Mengjiao Gua in the Black Forest of China. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3350.64s)]
*  And these guys in the middle of nowhere relayed the same telepathic message that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3356.04s)]
*  the children received in Rua Zimbabwe in 1994 at Ariel's school. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3360.2s)]
*  And by the way, I did include a piece of that in the film that I did with the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3366.56s)]
*  girls. I don't know, it's only like 10 minutes long. Quite fascinating. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3370.68s)]
*  That's a damn good case. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  That's in one of the 10 percent cases that I talk about. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3375.12s)]
*  But there's a film out now, I think it's called Ariel Phenomenon, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3377.72s)]
*  and it's all just about that case. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3380.96s)]
*  But those are the should we get back to like to 45 and work my way up? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3383.48s)]
*  Or do you want to talk a little bit about moment of contact? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3389.48s)]
*  We can get a little bit of contact is the case. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3391.84s)]
*  That could settle this debate once and for all, or let's tease people for a bit [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3396.16s)]
*  with moment of contact, because it is an amazing, amazing documentary. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3400.88s)]
*  I won't go into details. I won't go into any details. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3404.2s)]
*  I'll just say this. I will. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3406.6s)]
*  I put my reputation on the line for this. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3408.76s)]
*  I get it. It sounds so spectacular. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3410.76s)]
*  It sounds so unbelievable. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3414.28s)]
*  But when you watch the documentary, it sounds less spectacular. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3415.8s)]
*  Well, similarly spectacular, but more believable. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3418.96s)]
*  So here's it. Here's here's the point. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3421.96s)]
*  OK, it's either the most elaborate, complex hoax [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3423.8s)]
*  that involves half the town of Virginia. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3427.56s)]
*  There's like one hundred and thirty thousand people living there. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3429.6s)]
*  I mean, I go down to the town square and to start talking to people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3432.4s)]
*  I did it the movie and everybody's got a little piece of the puzzle. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3434.88s)]
*  Most people have a piece of the puzzle. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3437.76s)]
*  It's phenomenal. Or the UFO crashed. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3439.6s)]
*  Live aliens were recovered and the Americans. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3443.6s)]
*  I was captured by the Brazilian authorities [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3446.48s)]
*  and the Americans stepped in and flew some of that back to the United States. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3448.56s)]
*  And that's when the case goes cold. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3451.56s)]
*  There's no way between the sexiest version. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3454.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, there's no right. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3457.2s)]
*  There's no in between. But you speak of the sexiest versions. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3458.48s)]
*  This is I was looking at the thing in 94 in China. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3461.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Hold across this. Oh, good. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3463.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was saying. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3465.2s)]
*  Most bizarre contact in China occurred in June 7, 1994, when how do you say his name? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3466.2s)]
*  Meng Zhao Gua Meng Zhao Gua of Phoenix Mountain, food. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3470.96s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3475.1200000000003s)]
*  Fujian, Fujian, Fujian province province met a female alien. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3475.96s)]
*  First, there was electricity between them. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3481.6400000000003s)]
*  Then things got amorous. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3483.6000000000004s)]
*  According to Meng, the female alien looked like a white monster. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3485.92s)]
*  She was very tall, about two point five meters and wore tight clothes [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3490.04s)]
*  with only her big eyes and private parts exposed. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3493.84s)]
*  She did something to him that felt like an electric shock. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3497.1200000000003s)]
*  And he passed out when he came around. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3500.2000000000003s)]
*  He found several scars in his body, according to Wu. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3502.24s)]
*  She planted something mung bean sized in his body into his body. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3505.12s)]
*  Things were about to get even stranger. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3510.64s)]
*  Meng had sexual intercourse. The female alien. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3512.24s)]
*  She suddenly fell down on him. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3514.9199999999996s)]
*  He could hardly move. His penis felt hot. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3516.96s)]
*  Then ached. The experience was more pleasurable than anything he had ever felt. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3519.96s)]
*  That's him. Yeah. And they gave him a lie detector test. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3524.6s)]
*  And he passed it. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3526.8399999999997s)]
*  That doesn't I did not hear about that aspect as he encountered. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3527.8399999999997s)]
*  I heard about those, especially crazy to. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3530.6s)]
*  Yeah, I did not hear about that aspect of it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3532.68s)]
*  But I didn't I didn't go. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3535.56s)]
*  But my point is, he was banging aliens. Yeah. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3537.3199999999997s)]
*  Respect. Respect. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3540.7599999999998s)]
*  That takes a lot of courage. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3542.2s)]
*  But I was very attracted to the Avatar Lady, the big blue one that saves them. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3543.48s)]
*  So hot. So she's hot. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3548.64s)]
*  Well, we'll go back here. Let's let's go. Let's go. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3551.08s)]
*  I think she's hot. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3555.24s)]
*  Let's go back because I fucking switch right over to that. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3556.2799999999997s)]
*  I I am. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3559.2799999999997s)]
*  Here. So we'll get back to a moment of context. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3563.68s)]
*  I want to say the last thing with moment of context, and we'll get back to the other cases. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3566.88s)]
*  It's either the case we've all been waiting for, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3571.3199999999997s)]
*  the case that could settle the debate once and for all. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3574.6s)]
*  Right. If it's true, could you think of a more extraordinary? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3576.96s)]
*  Let's just say hypothetically for a moment, it happened. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3580.44s)]
*  As all the witnesses say, it happened. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3583.2799999999997s)]
*  How big of a story do you think that's an immense story? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3585.56s)]
*  Because it means that they're real. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3587.56s)]
*  If it's true, that it means they're real. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3589.44s)]
*  It means something that we don't understand was in the sky, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3591.16s)]
*  got hit by lightning, got caught up in a furious lightning storm and wound up crashing. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3595.92s)]
*  And that these things survived and they got out. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3601.84s)]
*  And the fact that one guy handled one of them and got this insane infection [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  and died very quickly afterwards, and he was very young and healthy military man. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3610.84s)]
*  And the fact that all these people have the same story, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3615.88s)]
*  they all have the same depiction of the disk, the craft. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3619.48s)]
*  They have the same depictions of seeing these beings. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3623.6000000000004s)]
*  Not one witness came to us. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3626.56s)]
*  We had to track down every one of those witnesses. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3629.4s)]
*  And there's a story behind each and every one of them that I could go on for an hour for. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3631.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure I won't bore you with the details, but suffice to say, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3635.7200000000003s)]
*  you wouldn't be able to bore me, bro. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3638.2000000000003s)]
*  We got a gravity bomb over there. We could be here for days. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3639.4s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3641.76s)]
*  I'd be like, I know. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3645.0400000000004s)]
*  But there's nothing that goes better than marijuana and aliens. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3647.2400000000002s)]
*  When I went every time I get back from Brazil, I'd get home and people. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3649.96s)]
*  And I'm out there for a month, knocking on doors, talking to witnesses, chasing people down, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3655.6000000000004s)]
*  trying to convince them to come forward like crazy. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3659.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, this is not like a quick venture to make this document. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3662.76s)]
*  Twelve years. That's insane. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3666.48s)]
*  And so. Wow. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3668.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I'd come home from a trip in Brazil. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3669.4s)]
*  And I'm telling you, man, it was like my mind was just torqued. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3672.36s)]
*  I was so I'm in another alternate reality. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3675.48s)]
*  I'm thinking, oh, my God, I'm coming to the realization that this happened. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3678.32s)]
*  When that man takes you to the spot and gets overwhelmed with emotion. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3682.48s)]
*  He was gone for 25 years. Marco Leal. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3688.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Marco and and co. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3691.1200000000003s)]
*  If I said that guy, we don't have a story. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3693.6s)]
*  We got to find we got to find Carlos de Sousa. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3695.36s)]
*  Yeah. Unless that guy is a Daniel Day Lewis quality actor. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3697.48s)]
*  We don't need Brad Pitt anymore, nor Leonardo DiCaprio. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3701.56s)]
*  This guy, that guy, if he's full of shit, best actor, he's one of the best actors ever. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3704.32s)]
*  Because that moment when he gets to that spot and he's overwhelmed with emotion, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3708.48s)]
*  he starts tearing up. Oh, yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3712.4s)]
*  And he's freaking out. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3713.96s)]
*  Like, just imagine if 25 years ago you experienced something that literally [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3714.92s)]
*  destroyed your understanding of life itself in the universe, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3719.96s)]
*  that there's a thing out there that can visit us that's different than us. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3724.56s)]
*  And it's probably been here forever. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3728.96s)]
*  My DP, David West, been shooting for over 40 years. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3731.0s)]

*  The guy was so believable, crying. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3739.12s)]
*  And I mean, not only that, but it's like the guy disappeared. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3741.04s)]
*  He's never made a dime off this. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3743.84s)]
*  He gave one statement 26 years ago to a guy named Clodio Covo. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3745.24s)]

*  That I just didn't include any of it because I just couldn't squeeze it in. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3807.84s)]
*  And there was too much. It was just too much. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3811.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you did it that way, honestly, because moment of contact is [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3813.16s)]
*  it's it's really good. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3816.48s)]

*  and fifty thousand people. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3830.28s)]
*  And then something happens and a fucking UFO crashes in a field [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3831.56s)]
*  and people witness it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3837.08s)]
*  And everyone is just stuck there. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3838.7599999999998s)]
*  Then the military shuts the town down. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3840.2799999999997s)]
*  Can you see this? Yes. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3842.36s)]
*  This is Brigadier Jose Carlos Pereira of the Brazilian Air Force. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3843.7999999999997s)]
*  OK, I met with him with Marco on two occasions. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3848.64s)]
*  The second occasion was to find that camera. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3853.16s)]
*  My I'm so sorry. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3855.08s)]
*  Would it be better? Jose Jose. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3856.12s)]
*  Yeah, no worse. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3858.64s)]
*  OK, this is Jose. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3860.72s)]
*  You can look him up. Jose Carlos Pereira, Brigadier Brazilian Air Force. OK. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3861.9199999999996s)]
*  So Marco and I met with him twice. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3867.3999999999996s)]
*  The second time was 2013. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3869.9199999999996s)]
*  He gave us an interview. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3872.9199999999996s)]
*  Some of it's in the film. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3874.12s)]
*  And he said, like, I'll talk about the 1986 UFOs over Brazil. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3875.8799999999997s)]
*  I'll talk about the colliders case that happened in the 70s. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3879.7999999999997s)]
*  Phenomenal photographic evidence that's out there. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3882.52s)]
*  You asked me about Virginia in this interview is terminated. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3885.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's like, what? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3889.36s)]
*  What do you mean terminated? Like, really? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3891.12s)]
*  So anyway, we do the interview and I was like, well, I'm not going to ask him, I guess. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3893.7599999999998s)]
*  But when the camera stopped rolling, I was like, please. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3897.48s)]
*  I mean, Marco and I were begging and pleading with this guy. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3900.2799999999997s)]
*  And I remember looked at him dead square in the eyes. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3902.4s)]
*  I said, I swear on my life, there are no recording devices. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3905.72s)]
*  There are no cameras rolling. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3909.72s)]
*  Please tell us about Virginia. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3912.16s)]
*  Why did you have that reaction to Virginia? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3914.52s)]
*  Marco was, too. We were begging. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3916.52s)]
*  I was practically licking this guy's boots and he's getting prepared to leave. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3918.44s)]
*  And he's got a driver waiting for him outside. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3921.4s)]
*  So we were following and pleading with him all the way out there. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3924.0s)]
*  Please just tell us, please. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3927.32s)]
*  I swear on my life, this happened. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3929.08s)]
*  He gets in the car, doors open. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3931.28s)]
*  He looks up and I'm only reason why I'm telling you this, because he died. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3933.68s)]
*  He looks up at Marco and I and he goes, it happened. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3936.64s)]
*  Close the door and off he went. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3940.16s)]
*  Now, the reason why I share that is because [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3941.6s)]
*  that's not something that I can put any weight on [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3944.64s)]
*  for the documentary for people like you. Right. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3947.24s)]
*  But as a personal message for me, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3949.56s)]
*  knowing that level of validation on the inside, it kept us going. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3952.68s)]
*  It was like, OK, why on earth would he have done that? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3958.28s)]
*  Why on earth would he say? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3961.96s)]
*  And that kept Marco and I going. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3963.64s)]
*  And that was a personal level of validation that is there any [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3965.16s)]
*  conventional explanation why the military shut everything down, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3969.36s)]
*  why they had military barricades set up around that area? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3972.76s)]
*  No, they did try to say that the creature was this guy [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3979.1200000000003s)]
*  who's got like some deformities. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3982.88s)]
*  But I've seen the guy, Modine or something like that. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3985.84s)]
*  But you talk to the witness. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3988.0s)]
*  But why would the why would the military shut the town down [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3989.48s)]
*  because a guy with deformities? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3992.0800000000004s)]
*  And then for the doctors in the hospital, they said, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3993.84s)]
*  oh, there was like a midget having a baby or something weird, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3996.28s)]
*  just something that was just so ridiculous. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=3999.1600000000003s)]
*  It was like and you talk to the witnesses and they're just like, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4001.04s)]
*  oh, come on, I'm not going to, you know, that's laughable at best. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4003.44s)]
*  You know, I mean, these girls [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4007.0s)]
*  came within eight to ten feet, three, three women, Katya, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4009.6s)]
*  two sisters, Liliani and Valkyria, 14, 16 and 21. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4015.44s)]
*  They got within eight to ten feet in broad daylight of this creature. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4020.52s)]
*  And one of the things that doesn't come across in the film [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4025.76s)]
*  when they saw this thing, they're looking like, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4028.84s)]
*  what are we looking at here? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4030.6000000000004s)]
*  They're walking through this field and it's up against a cinder block wall. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4031.6400000000003s)]
*  And one of them is looking at it. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4035.2000000000003s)]
*  What is that? And it was crouched by the wall. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4037.1600000000003s)]
*  It was weak and feeble. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4039.08s)]
*  And one of them kind of like screeched, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4040.96s)]
*  yeah, like, what is that? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4043.6800000000003s)]
*  And it turned and it looked right at the girls, locked eyes on them. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4044.88s)]
*  Liliani grabs her younger daughter, her younger sister, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4051.28s)]
*  who's 14, Valkyria and makes a high tells it out of there. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4054.0s)]
*  Katya is 21. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4058.0s)]
*  She's frozen in her tracks, locked eyes with this creature, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4060.08s)]
*  and it's communicating with her. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4062.6000000000004s)]
*  Please help me. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4064.04s)]
*  I'm he wants help. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4065.56s)]
*  It's weak. It's weak and it's feeble and it's scared. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4067.04s)]
*  And it's crouched down. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4069.7200000000003s)]
*  Liliani realizes that Katya is back there. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4072.1200000000003s)]
*  She gets, I don't know, 100 feet down the path. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4074.4s)]
*  She leaves her sister, stay here. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4076.88s)]
*  I'm going back to get Katya. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4078.48s)]
*  She runs back. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4079.84s)]
*  And I asked Katya and I asked all the girls [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4081.44s)]
*  during that moment of contact, when you lock eyes, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4085.6400000000003s)]
*  I know it's only a brief second, but during that moment of contact, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4088.0s)]
*  what did you feel like? Put me there. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4090.6800000000003s)]
*  That's where the title comes from, moment of contact, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4093.0s)]
*  because that was when they locked eyes on this creature. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4094.76s)]
*  And that's when Katya said, help me. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4097.28s)]
*  I'm scared. And it was feeble and suffering. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4099.08s)]
*  And it's it's a very powerful moment. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4102.16s)]
*  And and and these girls have been saying the same thing. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4104.76s)]
*  The mother, the first time I'd ever reported on these so-called [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4108.400000000001s)]
*  like men in dark suits that show up and intimidate witnesses. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4111.400000000001s)]
*  Honestly, I've been hearing about those cases for so many times, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4114.96s)]
*  but I've avoided them because it's got so much baggage from men in black. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4117.72s)]
*  It just it's just ridiculous. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4121.0s)]
*  I just didn't want to be associated with it. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4122.320000000001s)]
*  But I'd heard it. I can go on until I'm blue in the face. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4124.4400000000005s)]
*  I go to tomorrow morning with the amount of cases with generals, too. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4126.6s)]
*  But this time, when the mother said that these men showed up [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4131.320000000001s)]
*  and tried to get the daughters to say they were lying [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4134.92s)]
*  and offered her a briefcase full of hundred dollar bills [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4136.64s)]
*  and they could relocate, I don't know, for some reason, I said, OK, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4139.56s)]
*  for the first time in 25 years, I'm going to report on these guys. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4143.52s)]
*  And I did. And it's in the movie. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4146.52s)]
*  You can hear the mother talking about it. And she's so emotional. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4148.6s)]
*  And the mother came back to the location where it happened. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4150.88s)]
*  The smell, that stench and the footprint on the ground. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4153.68s)]
*  I mean, everybody talks about that stench that was so they said, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4157.76s)]
*  if you take like a skunk, multiply that by like a hundred thousand. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4161.400000000001s)]
*  That would give you some indication of the level of like [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4166.240000000001s)]
*  how putrid and nasty was paralyzing. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4168.6s)]
*  And it stayed in like it stayed in the areas, like at the hospitals [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4171.84s)]
*  when they did the X-rays and everybody talks about it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4174.88s)]
*  That stench there is unbelievable. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4177.68s)]
*  Like it fills your navel cavities and doesn't leave for a week. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4179.56s)]
*  It was incredible. And then they all said the same thing. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4183.6s)]
*  And they couldn't get it out. They couldn't get it out. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4185.68s)]
*  Yeah, they sanitized the hospital. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4188.080000000001s)]
*  The guy said that he had to close off that wing of the hospital [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4189.76s)]
*  while they were sanitizing it because it was so intense. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4191.84s)]
*  You know, so I I. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4194.88s)]
*  How long did it last for? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4197.200000000001s)]
*  I heard days and weeks is what I heard from people. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4199.48s)]
*  And even the mother said when she when she went to where the creature was, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4202.2s)]
*  she said that the stench, even there after the creature was gone, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4207.24s)]
*  got in her nasal cavities and she tried to flush it out [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4210.2s)]
*  with water and saline or whatever. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4213.44s)]
*  And and and she couldn't get it out of her nasal cavities. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4215.28s)]
*  Really crazy. But they all did. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4220.0s)]
*  I mean, everybody talked about that stench. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4221.4s)]
*  You know, I mean, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4223.5599999999995s)]
*  the military officer, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4226.32s)]
*  the guy that drove the creature around, I was sitting across from him. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4228.68s)]
*  You can't see his face, but I did. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4232.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm looking at this guy in the eyes. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4234.64s)]
*  I'm thinking I could be looking at a guy [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4237.320000000001s)]
*  that drove a fucking alien around. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4240.360000000001s)]
*  You have no idea, dude. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4243.400000000001s)]
*  You have no idea. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4245.8s)]
*  How did he describe it? So fucking intense. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4246.72s)]
*  When I came back from that trip, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4250.160000000001s)]
*  people were like, how was your trip to Brazil? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4252.6s)]
*  What was it like, man? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4256.280000000001s)]
*  They got great, you know, smoothies and coffee. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4257.08s)]
*  And I'm just like, you guys have no idea. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4260.88s)]
*  I think I think an alien spaceship crashed [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4264.5199999999995s)]
*  and they recover live aliens. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4268.08s)]
*  And we made contact and the Americans came in. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4269.84s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking about. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4271.88s)]
*  So I told a couple of people [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4272.64s)]
*  on the last trip I came back, I was just like, I was so rocked. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4275.72s)]
*  I couldn't I couldn't reintegrate back into culture. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4278.36s)]
*  It was Joe. I was just like, fuck, I think this happened. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4281.08s)]
*  It's the biggest story ever. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4286.04s)]
*  So people were asking me, even my neighbor who runs like the [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4287.2s)]
*  he runs that Make-A-Wish Foundation. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4291.4s)]
*  He was like, James, he goes, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4292.92s)]
*  bro, I like you a lot and I got a lot of respect for you, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4296.68s)]
*  but you lost me on this one. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4299.2s)]
*  And I was like, I don't blame you, bro. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4301.0s)]
*  I really don't. But listen to the witnesses. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4302.4s)]
*  Just that's all I say. Just and [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4305.36s)]
*  and I would tell people and I realized I can't talk about it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4309.12s)]
*  All I can say is just listen to the witnesses. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4312.96s)]
*  Don't take it from me. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4315.2s)]
*  But I'm looking at that guy in the eyes, Joe. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4316.76s)]
*  And I've been at this for 30 years. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4319.4s)]
*  I've made almost I'm working on my seventh film right now. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4321.56s)]
*  I'm looking this guy in the eyes and I'm like, this guy probably [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4325.08s)]
*  drove an alien around and it tripped me out so hard. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4327.44s)]
*  And it ruined his life. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4331.28s)]
*  He's he's to get this guy to go on camera. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4333.24s)]
*  Just like a week earlier, he was like, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4337.04s)]
*  I don't care all the money in the world. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4340.0s)]
*  I'm never coming forward. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4341.320000000001s)]
*  The risks are too high. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4343.04s)]
*  How did it ruin his life? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4344.64s)]
*  Because you're harboring the secret. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4346.280000000001s)]
*  You're being watched. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4348.56s)]
*  You're being told not to ever talk about this. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4349.88s)]
*  And you're looking over your shoulder all the time. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4352.68s)]
*  And they call you. The military calls you periodically. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4355.0s)]
*  They want to know where you are. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4357.320000000001s)]
*  And he's got this secret inside him that he can't tell the rest of the world. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4359.04s)]
*  And he's thinking about all the different. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4363.200000000001s)]
*  Everyone's out there speculating. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4365.200000000001s)]
*  Is it real? Is it fake? Is it real? Fake? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4366.8s)]
*  And this guy drove a body around. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4368.88s)]
*  Just think about that for a second. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4371.4800000000005s)]
*  Think about the doctor who took the X-rays of this thing. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4373.84s)]
*  Marco Leal. Thank you, Marco. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4378.2s)]
*  You're the man. Marco Leal found him. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4380.400000000001s)]
*  Eight years ago. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4384.08s)]
*  And he was like, he confirmed the story. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4385.72s)]
*  He was still working at regional hospital. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4388.24s)]
*  He goes, I'll never come forward. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4390.36s)]
*  Marco kept going every year back and forth. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4392.4800000000005s)]
*  Then he retired. And four years after retired, he agreed to meet with us. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4394.4400000000005s)]
*  He wasn't even sure he was going to go on. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4398.88s)]
*  And I said, look, man, we'll put you will film you from the back. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4400.24s)]
*  We'll disguise your voice. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4402.28s)]
*  Showed his photographs of him at the hospital. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4403.4400000000005s)]
*  We know he's been we've been trying to get at him. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4405.28s)]
*  Excuse me. At the end of the interview. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4408.84s)]
*  He said, thank you. I feel so much better. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4412.4400000000005s)]
*  I've been shouldering that burden for 26 years, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4415.72s)]
*  and I've so desperately wanted to tell somebody to share that story [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4418.24s)]
*  with the rest of the world. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4422.04s)]
*  And you meet these people and you think, why on earth? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4423.400000000001s)]
*  They didn't come to us. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4426.32s)]
*  They're not trying to sell their story. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4428.0s)]
*  We tracked them down and begged and pleaded with them to come forward. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4430.04s)]
*  When I found Martha, the sister of the deceased military officer, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4433.8s)]
*  Marco Charisi, we were knocking on doors. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4438.12s)]
*  I remember the sound guy from from Rio de Janeiro. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4441.68s)]
*  He was like, you're out of your mind. What are you doing? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4444.08s)]
*  Can't just knock on random doors. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4446.32s)]
*  I was like, man, if there's a will, there's a way. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4448.56s)]
*  I'm going to find this lady. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4450.24s)]
*  And we found her. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4452.04s)]
*  And it was like this kind of kind of sketchy area. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4453.64s)]
*  You know, it's like when you when you get out of your car [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4456.92s)]
*  and you could see like people drawing the curtains back and looking at you [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4459.320000000001s)]
*  and you're standing out like, dude, I stood out like a sore thumb, man. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4462.4400000000005s)]
*  And then we walked up and had Marco with me. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4466.360000000001s)]
*  Thank God. And we had camera crews and stuff. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4468.84s)]
*  It's kind of sketchy. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4470.84s)]
*  And Martha appears and her husband appears in this big. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4472.4400000000005s)]
*  He's a big guy and he's got like a white beater shirt on. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4477.08s)]
*  And he looks like he wants to rip my head off. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4480.200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, and she's looking at me. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4483.4800000000005s)]
*  And he's just looking at her going, Martha is looking. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4485.96s)]
*  Martha is looking at her husband and her husband's looking at Marcho [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4488.68s)]
*  like, give me the signal. I'll kill this guy. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4491.04s)]
*  That's the fucking and I is looking at Marco. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4493.08s)]
*  And I was like, James, you need to think quick on your feet right now. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4495.76s)]
*  And I said immediately, please translate this. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4499.200000000001s)]
*  I'm here to give your brother justice. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4501.16s)]
*  I'm here to get the story out. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4503.4800000000005s)]
*  Please talk to me. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4505.320000000001s)]
*  And we developed a relationship with her slowly over that. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4507.8s)]
*  And those are the first words that we exchanged. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4510.08s)]
*  And we eventually got her to come forward. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4512.0s)]
*  We talked. She'd gone forward in the past, but she doesn't know who the hell I am. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4513.84s)]
*  I want to take you back to the doctor. OK. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4517.64s)]
*  What when you talk to the doctor, what did he describe? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4520.2s)]
*  He said that that it was a normal day. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4523.24s)]
*  January 1996, regional hospital. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4526.56s)]
*  Every day and all of a sudden, all these military trucks and police [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4530.2s)]
*  cars showed up at the hospital. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4533.56s)]
*  They come in armed and they got a bag. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4535.68s)]
*  They got a thing in a black body bag. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4539.320000000001s)]
*  And he was like, what the hell's going on here? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4542.56s)]
*  They're all you're going to be taking some X-rays. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4545.68s)]
*  And he's like, OK. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4548.16s)]
*  And they had him inside and they had armed groups. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4549.68s)]
*  And I was asking him, like, what was it like? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4553.32s)]
*  Because when I when I interview witnesses, I always want them. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4554.96s)]
*  I always ask them to project like I sometimes I'll even close my eyes [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4558.4s)]
*  because I'll use their words to recreate. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4562.12s)]
*  So I'm like living it through them. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4564.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4566.4400000000005s)]
*  Mm hmm. So I'll close my eyes. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4567.24s)]
*  And I'll recreate the scenes in my head with their words. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4570.0s)]
*  Right. It's harder in Portuguese because I'm having to get it translated. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4575.0s)]
*  But I ask questions like, what was the atmosphere like? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4578.24s)]
*  Do there any talking? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4581.639999999999s)]
*  No talking. Super tense atmosphere. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4583.12s)]
*  Very tense. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4585.88s)]
*  Arm guards on the outside, arm guards on the inside, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4586.88s)]
*  military trucks running. Nobody comes. Nobody goes. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4589.84s)]
*  And he said, I first time in my history, in the history of my career, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4593.5199999999995s)]
*  I took the X-rays and I couldn't even verify that they were good [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4596.96s)]
*  because they took them immediately. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4599.92s)]
*  And then they said this event never happened. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4601.8s)]
*  He said the stench in the in the in the hospital was overwhelming. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4603.4800000000005s)]
*  And he goes through the different [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  X-rays that he took the abdomen, the head, the arms, the legs, the thorax. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4610.52s)]
*  You know. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4616.12s)]
*  And it was incredible. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4618.08s)]
*  In fact, Ubatajada Rodriguez, if you're listening to this, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4620.4800000000005s)]
*  he's one of the leading researchers has gone quiet. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4623.0s)]
*  Pecacini disappeared for 20 years. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4625.719999999999s)]
*  So did he get to see images himself? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4627.5199999999995s)]
*  Did he get to see the body himself? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4630.44s)]
*  Oh, he saw that he was right. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4631.84s)]
*  Well, they didn't open the body bag, but he was he was. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4632.76s)]
*  He said the stench was just overwhelming. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4635.639999999999s)]
*  So they X-rayed it through the body. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4637.76s)]
*  They X-rayed it through the body bag. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4638.96s)]
*  So he never got to see. He did not see the alien. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4640.5199999999995s)]
*  And he didn't get to see the X-ray images or anything. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4643.08s)]
*  Nope. They wouldn't let him see a damn thing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4645.5599999999995s)]
*  No. Now, there were two doctors. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4648.639999999999s)]
*  There was a guy named Roger Lear. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4651.32s)]
*  Roger Lear found out these are people that I really want to meet. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4654.04s)]
*  I mean, people are coming forward in droves right now. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4657.799999999999s)]
*  We just got two forensic pathologists for the first time ever [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4660.24s)]
*  working together to come forward to make statements. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4664.12s)]
*  And they're providing documentation of the of the autopsy reports [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4666.36s)]
*  done on the deceased military officer. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4670.32s)]
*  That's the first time ever these guys are coming forward. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4672.839999999999s)]
*  And it's happening right now. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4675.32s)]
*  Let's explain what happened to people who haven't watched the documentary. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4676.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. Deceased military officer. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4679.28s)]
*  Yeah. So so right after the three girls came in, came within eight to ten feet [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4680.68s)]
*  of this creature or being or entity or E.T., whatever you want to call it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4686.400000000001s)]
*  About an hour later, when I was about three o'clock in the afternoon, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4691.12s)]
*  I would say probably maybe around five o'clock, there were two military guys [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4694.280000000001s)]
*  on patrol on the lookout for something unusual. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4697.88s)]
*  What they were told, they didn't say a UFO had crashed. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4700.76s)]
*  They were on the lookout for something highly unusual. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4703.400000000001s)]
*  And it was Eric Lopes at the wheel and Marco Shreese, military police [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4706.04s)]
*  in the passenger seat. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4710.0s)]
*  They were about a block and a half to two blocks away [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4712.120000000001s)]
*  from where the girls had seen the creature a couple of hours earlier. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4714.68s)]
*  And this thing runs across the car in front of him. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4717.88s)]
*  He had slammed his brakes on. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4721.360000000001s)]
*  And without a moment's hesitation, Marco Shreese jumps out of the car [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4723.0s)]
*  and grabs the thing with his bare hands. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4727.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And he puts it in the back seat and they drive it to a clinic. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4729.8s)]
*  And the doctor is like, what the hell is that? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4733.240000000001s)]
*  Get it out of here. I don't know what we leave. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4735.8s)]
*  So they went to regional hospital. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4737.8s)]
*  And then ultimately, it went to Humanitas Hospital. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4740.08s)]
*  And so we have testimony from military acts [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4742.8s)]
*  that when he drove it from Humanitas Hospital, it's in the movie, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4745.72s)]
*  but he drove it from Humanitas Hospital to [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4748.68s)]
*  as a military base where it spent the night in the truck for one night. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4752.280000000001s)]
*  And then it went from there to Espacex Campinas. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4755.320000000001s)]
*  It's like a university. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4757.96s)]
*  It's where all the intellectual scientific heavyweights reside. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4759.12s)]
*  And then it was there, I think, under examination, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4762.6s)]
*  according to the witnesses that we talked to for a day or two. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4765.0s)]
*  And that's when the Americans flew in to Campinas. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4767.4s)]
*  And we have the radar military control officer who came forward last year, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4770.92s)]
*  actually two years ago when we were there filming for the last time. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4775.32s)]
*  His name is Marco Fedes, F-E-R-E-S. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4778.48s)]
*  And he came forward for the first time and said, yeah, in January of 1996, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4782.32s)]
*  this plane came in. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4786.44s)]
*  USAF, he kept calling it, United States Air Force came in. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4787.48s)]
*  It didn't have the authorization of the Brazilian government. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4790.32s)]
*  He was like, this thing can't land. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4793.28s)]
*  And some higher up stepped in. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4795.08s)]
*  This is all his testimony. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4796.4s)]
*  Just relaying what he said. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4798.719999999999s)]
*  He said some higher up came in the room and said, let it land. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4800.32s)]
*  And it came and it landed at Campinas. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4802.639999999999s)]
*  And then from Campinas, two helicopters, according to him, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4804.92s)]
*  flew to Varginha, Brazil, Varginha back to Campinas. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4808.36s)]
*  Then they loaded something on the airplane and then off to the United States. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4812.24s)]
*  And that's where the case goes cold. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4815.0s)]
*  So I will say this. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4818.839999999999s)]
*  One of the most exciting aspects for me to getting invited on your show [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4821.04s)]
*  is that you've got you've got a huge platform of a lot of people listening. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4825.08s)]
*  I want to know, we all want to know desperately [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4830.759999999999s)]
*  what happened when the United States took over. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4835.08s)]
*  Where did this stuff go? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4837.5599999999995s)]
*  Who was involved? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4839.5599999999995s)]
*  Who flew that airplane? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4840.5599999999995s)]
*  The flight records, all of these things. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4842.16s)]
*  And I want to know, what happened? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4844.36s)]
*  What happened? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4846.28s)]
*  What happened? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4847.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4847.5599999999995s)]
*  What happened? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4847.96s)]
*  What happened? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4848.5199999999995s)]
*  The flight records, all of these things. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4849.28s)]
*  And so I'm asking you, please, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4852.28s)]
*  please, if you're listening to this to come forward and talk to us. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4855.44s)]
*  This is an ongoing investigation. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4858.68s)]
*  If you're too afraid to talk to me, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4859.72s)]
*  there's new whistleblower protection that Senator Jill [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4862.64s)]
*  LeBrand and Rubio and a handful of others just signed into law. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4866.0s)]
*  You can go and contact someone like, on, on, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4869.48s)]
*  Representative Andre Carson. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4871.92s)]
*  And there's a process you can go and testify and tell everything [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4873.72s)]
*  that we know without fear of prosecution or violating any NDAs. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4876.2s)]
*  beg and plead for you to do that. Now, excuse me, there are a handful of Congress people [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4879.0s)]
*  and senators that I believe are sincerely trying to get down to the bottom of this stuff. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4884.96s)]
*  I've met with some of them and I've continued to try to meet with someone else. I'm working [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4890.24s)]
*  with a guy named Brian Bender. He's kind of consulted on the project. He worked for Politico [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4893.9s)]
*  and he's got great access as well. So the two of us are trying to, we're trying to address [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4898.12s)]
*  the evidence, the photographic evidence, the potential debris evidence, the potential body [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4903.76s)]
*  evidence. Where is it and who has the authority to release it? I've never really covered it [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4910.92s)]
*  and I know that I put my reputation on the line, Joe, and I totally understand for your [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4918.200000000001s)]
*  audience that are listening to this right now and thinking that I've lost my marbles [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4922.76s)]
*  and I completely respect that. I had the same reaction myself and I'm not out here trying [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4926.160000000001s)]
*  to sell crazy. I don't have a GoFundMe asking for money on evidence that I don't have. I'm [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4931.2s)]
*  not doing any of that. All I'm saying is this is potentially the biggest story that we've [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4935.48s)]
*  all been waiting for, the story that in my opinion could settle the debate once and for [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4944.16s)]
*  all. This story happened in 1996 and the vast majority of the witnesses are still alive. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4951.24s)]
*  People are coming forward in droves right now. Like I said earlier on the show, those [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4958.24s)]
*  two doctors coming forward, the forensic pathologist, you want science? They're giving us science. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4962.12s)]
*  They're giving us the long form autopsy report. Leslie Kane is having it professionally and [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4967.5599999999995s)]
*  medically translated and she'll have it looked at by medical people that she knows. So that's [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4971.94s)]
*  an ongoing investigation. Just the fact that Mark O'Leal and we got access to those people. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4977.84s)]
*  I was doing Zoom calls all last week leading up to coming here, begging them and pleading [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4982.44s)]
*  them to come forward. Please. Do you really want this actual footage? Of course we want [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4986.42s)]
*  footage. You saw what I showed you earlier. Come on man. You know I'm going after it. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=4992.54s)]
*  I know it's what we need. I'm telling you right now. It's so close. It seems like you [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5001.78s)]
*  can just barely touch it. It's like a movie when you reach for the key. I know you can't [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5004.9800000000005s)]
*  quite reach it. It's like you see it dangling right there. You're like come on. I get criticized [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5011.06s)]

*  Look you got to start somewhere. It starts with a story. How are you supposed to go looking [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5019.28s)]
*  for something if you don't even know it exists? So now we know that it exists. We've talked [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5023.759999999999s)]
*  to people that have seen it. In fact, Michael Schellenberger called me up when the film first [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5028.639999999999s)]

*  story. He was like man this is pretty wild. I was like yeah. He goes well I'm thinking [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5045.679999999999s)]

*  quite surprised. The New York Post wanted more than one source. They wanted two sources [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5062.799999999999s)]
*  that could see it and describe it. And we made it happen. Packuccini was shown video footage. He [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5067.44s)]
*  describes it in vivid detail. Go find the New York Post article by Michael Schellenberger and I [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5072.5599999999995s)]

*  We know where it is and we know who has it. Do you have it Jamie? Yeah. And it's like the frustration [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5084.08s)]
*  is I remember one of the people that we approached on. We offered a hundred thousand dollars [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5089.36s)]
*  and it was nothing. Then we offered two hundred thousand dollars. People claim they saw aliens [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5094.24s)]

*  movie and it was shocking to me was that we stayed at the we rented this house in this kind of gated [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5132.4s)]

*  we're all in this together if there's enough compelling eyewitness testimony to make one think [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5677.44s)]
*  this very well might have happened doesn't that merit further investigation doesn't that merit [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5684.0s)]

*  i'm so busy right now he goes well what he didn't tell me was i've got cancer and i'm dying [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5781.360000000001s)]

*  so anyway he died he gives me these tapes and then he dies i actually i sent the tapes back [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5791.6s)]
*  to him and then he died and um and i got his book too and i was reading his book when i'm [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5796.16s)]

*  these witnesses and it's all on camera except the meeting with according to his book that took [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5814.96s)]
*  place in the humanities hospital with two doctors i couldn't validate this and i didn't put it in [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5821.28s)]
*  the movie but if there's two doctors are listening to this apparently the creature was alive the one [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5826.8s)]
*  that marco scherisi brought into humanities hospital was alive and according to dr roger lear's book [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5832.16s)]
*  everything else was accurate i can't say if this was accurate or not but he put it in his book so [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5838.72s)]
*  i'm assuming that it is and uberto jara won't talk about it he's a witness there were two doctors [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5843.44s)]
*  that claimed telepathic communication with the live entity and that's in his book now i'm not [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5848.32s)]

*  that entity that creature that being that et whatever you want to call it went to humanities [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5858.0s)]
*  hospital we know that because we have testimony from the people that took it there we have [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5862.879999999999s)]
*  testimony from people on the inside that claimed it was there but we don't have any testimony from [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5866.799999999999s)]
*  the doctors that claimed there was a telepathic communication do they talk at all about what it [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5872.56s)]
*  said it said that they were they felt sorry for the human species not realizing their their [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5877.68s)]
*  potential who they really want who they really are like they're not uh they don't we don't realize [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5882.96s)]
*  as a as a race who we really are that's what they said it's in his book so anyway what did they mean [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5888.72s)]
*  by that uh that we're that that we don't recognize i mean i'm not quite sure i guess that we don't [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5893.68s)]
*  recognize the potential that we have as human beings who we really are i'm not sure what they [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5901.36s)]
*  meant exactly more than that but if uberajada rodriguez is listening to this please come forward [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5906.5599999999995s)]
*  and tell me who those doctors are if the doctors are listening to this they're still alive what [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5911.92s)]

*  or sort it out i want i want people to know about this case and i want people to know that this is [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5940.0s)]
*  an ongoing investigation this is not solved this is an ongoing investigation it's something that [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5945.04s)]
*  uh we could all hopefully unite and and and really push to get answers both on the u.s side and [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5951.4400000000005s)]
*  in the brazil side we have a lot more answers in brazil we've got not a lot going on i know [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5958.32s)]
*  that leslie cain is is is pushing she's contacting some of her people on the inside that have indicated [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5962.32s)]
*  that it did happen but to me one of the weirdest ones was ryan graves because ryan graves has [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5968.639999999999s)]
*  explained to me how they upgraded their systems sort of picking that stuff up and they started [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5975.44s)]
*  instantaneously picking up these things that were just defying physics yes they didn't have [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5980.48s)]
*  the ability to detect before because the systems weren't as good just interviewed him in washington [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5984.72s)]
*  dc and you know one thing that he told me that i was fascinated by he said that the admiral came [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5988.96s)]
*  in i think it was in 2015 when they'd just gotten that that one object that was kind of rotating [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5993.92s)]
*  kind of like a disc looking thing he said that the admiral came in and he was like oh god the [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=5999.4400000000005s)]
*  admiral's here and they had a debriefing on it and they were showing the videos and the admiral [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6004.240000000001s)]
*  stepped in and he took a look at it for five seconds and it's much longer than five seconds [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6007.360000000001s)]
*  he shrugged his shoulder and it's kind of like oh boy and he walked out of the room i was like [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6013.44s)]
*  well what did that mean he goes that means in my opinion that he was very aware of this is [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6017.2s)]
*  this phenomenon is nothing new it's been going on and they've known about it but what can they do [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6022.4s)]
*  right what can you do what can you do you try chasing them they fly rings around your jets i [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6027.12s)]
*  mean they're doing what they're doing it's almost like they have their own agenda who the hell knows [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6031.2s)]
*  but they're stationary they're in the air he goes they don't have to recharge that is it the gimbal [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6035.2s)]
*  footage yeah turned sideways yeah i think it's called the gimbal there's the go fast there's the [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6040.48s)]
*  tic tac there's the gimbal see if you can find that gimbal footage the gimbal footage is fascinating [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6044.5599999999995s)]
*  because you see it rotate yeah you see it do this thing that everybody describes taking it night [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6049.2s)]
*  and i'd also like to put out there if there are any pilots any military personnel that have any [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6053.919999999999s)]
*  photographic evidence and you'd like to come forward with it please do so i've got a new project and [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6061.679999999999s)]
*  you can do it anonymously hopefully you'll do it not anonymous this is the thing but whatever it [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6068.32s)]
*  takes it's flying and there's another one too because it's slightly better maybe he changes [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6072.639999999999s)]
*  the i think he does yeah there it goes yeah that looks like kind of like this way and then with [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6078.48s)]
*  the clouds somewhere along and it looks very similar to those things that we were just looking [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6084.0s)]
*  at those photographs very similar it looks very disc-like these are the tip that's another thing [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6089.2s)]
*  that that senator reid revealed to me during the interview he said that here's it rotates the [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6095.68s)]
*  object it's wild he said that the the material the evidence that's been released this was senator [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6101.76s)]
*  harry reid former senate majority leader harry reid told me this on camera the evidence that's [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6108.4800000000005s)]
*  been released is just the tip of the iceberg now let me go through a couple cases do you mind [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6113.76s)]
*  please all right and the reason why i say this is because i talked to you earlier about [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6119.84s)]
*  that some ufos some uap i can't underline that word enough represent [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6123.68s)]
*  or originate from a non-human intelligence and i'm going to go through a handful of cases that i [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6132.32s)]
*  personally have looked into these are cases that upon that could prove one way or the other [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6136.24s)]
*  certainly make a very compelling argument that that some of these objects so let's start with [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6142.96s)]
*  1945 trinity jacque valet just wrote a book with a woman named paula harris a fascinating case i [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=6148.64s)]

*  he remembers it a little bit differently so he described it one way back then and another way [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7673.200000000001s)]
*  now just exactly the same but that the military trucks were either there or already there or [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7678.320000000001s)]
*  coming just a little variation that's very possible yeah just forgot it definitely that's not as [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7682.8s)]
*  important as what he saw no and and then like i give you another example like you know carlos [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7688.080000000001s)]
*  asouza is convinced that that was on the 13th of because he was going he's an ultralight pilot [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7694.0s)]
*  he's also like a history or geography professor in sao paulo that it was the 13th of january [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7698.4s)]
*  and the girls saw the creature on the 20th of january how did those creatures get from the [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7704.56s)]
*  crash site to the to the town well there's a river and i've talked to some researchers that think [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7708.16s)]
*  that that's possibility because the river goes from the crash site right to the area where the [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7712.48s)]
*  creatures were found could it be they got in the water i don't know maybe i have no idea and what [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7716.72s)]
*  do they do for six days i have no idea so the crash was six days different from the crash [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7721.68s)]
*  happens according to the witnesses according to sousa he's convinced it happened on the 13th [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7728.8s)]
*  and the girls they know they saw the creatures on the 20th so you see i'm saying like and then how [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7734.400000000001s)]
*  do they get what happened during that period what about the record of when the u.s air force jet [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7740.72s)]
*  that was the guy's the guy marco fedez he said it was january he was like ah 20th 21st [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7746.400000000001s)]
*  he's like yeah he's like i think it's 20th 21st something like that so it's somewhere in that oh [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7756.72s)]
*  totally well right in there and it and the and the plane lands without authorization from the [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7762.08s)]
*  brazilian government and it lands in campinas and then the helicopters go from campinas to virginia [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7767.52s)]
*  and then they go from virginia back to campinas they load something on the airplane and the united [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7774.88s)]
*  states air force takes off again all without any authorization from the brazilian government [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7779.04s)]
*  and that's what these guys are saying every single military person that we met with we put a lot of [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7784.0s)]
*  little nuggets in the in the credits at the end they all said the americans were involved [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7789.28s)]
*  because i didn't know when i went into this i had no idea isn't it fascinating that they would listen [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7793.92s)]
*  to us it's absolutely fascinating and i want them to come forward people on the u.s side come [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7798.08s)]
*  forward please we need your testimony this is the case that could solve this riddle once and for [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7803.52s)]
*  all because the people that saw it were alive and it seems like there's real footage and real [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7809.200000000001s)]
*  photography what would you do what would you do for the footage of the creature you personally [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7814.080000000001s)]
*  what would you do for it would you go to brazil i'm just asking just to get it if you were guaranteed [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7819.6s)]
*  to get it when you got there would you go for it if i was you you i'm talking to you why i'm just [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7825.040000000001s)]
*  curious you wouldn't do it i'm busy i know you are footage of an alien yeah i'm not going okay but [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7830.16s)]
*  if you go i'll definitely watch the video when you bring it back yeah logan paul logan paul was like [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7836.8s)]
*  well i want to guarantee you i said logan there are no guarantees in life there's death and taxes [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7842.32s)]
*  okay and well especially to a guy like you has been chasing this for 12 years well that case yeah i [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7846.96s)]
*  know it's well you know i mean i look at marco leal and i look at these other researchers and [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7852.24s)]
*  i tip my hat to them but it's amazing it's a phenomenal if it really is a look it makes sense [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7856.56s)]
*  that we're not alone and it makes sense regardless of what people like neil degrasse tyson think [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7863.76s)]
*  i can't believe you just said that yeah okay so here's my thing we love neil degrasse tyson he is [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7869.280000000001s)]
*  a treasure to the world he makes science exciting he gets children interested the guy is gregarious [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7878.16s)]
*  he's funny he's wicked bright but when he talks about this aspect uap or ufo we all cringe because [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7887.36s)]
*  he clearly doesn't know and he goes right to et and like nobody's screaming from the hilltop et [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7896.5599999999995s)]
*  we're saying that there are structured craft of unknown origin exhibiting a technology far beyond [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7902.639999999999s)]
*  anything that we comprehend according to the military people i've talked to around the world [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7909.04s)]
*  and we don't know what they where they come from we'd like to know and i say to neil degrasse [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7913.599999999999s)]
*  tyson i'm serious and i i hope you don't take this the wrong way but i'll put 25 000 on the table [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7918.5599999999995s)]
*  right here and right now if he watches the phenomenon and he has the same position after [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7924.32s)]
*  watching that evidence that we put together carefully with the help of jock fillet and many [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7930.72s)]
*  others to present that case to a jury if he has the same viewpoint after he watches that film [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7934.64s)]
*  you tell me pick any organization of your choice non-profit and i'll give 25 000 to that i don't [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7940.320000000001s)]
*  think you're gonna change his mind with that documentary no uh well no what he's gonna say is [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7946.56s)]
*  what he's gonna say is clearly there's something going on because i even got michael schermer [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7950.56s)]
*  who skeptic magazine is like yeah wow this is intriguing because you know you know mecha kaku [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7954.88s)]
*  has publicly stated now that the preponderance of evidence is now it's it leans in the direction [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7959.44s)]
*  of it being real yeah no it's not look the phenomenon is real the only speculation is what [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7966.799999999999s)]
*  is it what is it you know people jump to conclusions quickly and they start talking about babies [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7972.5599999999995s)]
*  floating in any incubators out of alfazontari and that's when you just lose everybody it's like whoa [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7976.639999999999s)]
*  hang on a second nobody's saying that what we're saying is there's a physical phenomenon [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7982.0s)]
*  taking place nuts and bolts craft that are flying rings around our fastest jets that have left [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7989.2s)]
*  imprints on the ground they're picked up by radar sensor photographic sensors flir sensors they're [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=7994.88s)]
*  seen visually some cases people claim that we've recovered them okay but let's just forget even [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8000.0s)]
*  that aspect of it let's just say that you know the david fravers of the world and there's cases [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8007.92s)]
*  dating back forever i mean really credible cases what are those is it us wow well if it's us [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8012.08s)]
*  they sure have been hiding some revolutionary technology for over 75 years that in itself is [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8019.12s)]
*  a huge story they've got things that fly without wings without visible means of propulsion without [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8024.64s)]
*  making any sound any air disturbance that can do right angle turns at high speed everything we know [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8030.0s)]
*  would shatter on the inside of that cockpit particularly humans so what i'm saying is [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8035.5199999999995s)]
*  we've we know that we know that five or ten percent of this represents possibly [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8040.8s)]
*  originating from a non-human intelligence that seems to be the direction we're leaning in [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8046.639999999999s)]
*  so when neil degrasse tyson comes forward and says what he says i'm like you're just not [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8052.08s)]
*  i've had intelligence folks go god i'd like to talk to that guy just with the weirdest one he says [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8056.5599999999995s)]
*  is that why would they be interested in us which i find hilarious why wouldn't they be interested [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8060.719999999999s)]
*  in us yeah why wouldn't they be of course especially once we develop nuclear technology [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8065.84s)]
*  nuclear technology totally i mean i mean we could fuck up we're we're crazy territorial apes has to [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8072.72s)]
*  be a correlation there yeah i mean it makes sense it only makes sense it literally only makes it [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8079.360000000001s)]
*  really you're an alien life form that is interested in in the development of intelligent life in the [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8085.120000000001s)]
*  universe you would realize is probably a precarious balancing point when they reach this apex of [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8090.400000000001s)]
*  technology especially when it comes to nuclear power and especially when it comes to like what [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8095.200000000001s)]
*  we have available here on earth in terms of natural resources and we battle for it and we [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8099.68s)]
*  control we're like we're territorial we control territories we're like aggressive yeah we're we're [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8105.6s)]
*  crazy we're like we shoot at these things warlords we shoot at these yeah we shoot at these things [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8111.360000000001s)]
*  and we certainly have in the past so i mean i think they're probably beyond our ability to [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8116.64s)]
*  interact with them in that way they're probably so sophisticated that they're well aware of [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8125.04s)]
*  guns and and things that could could damage them and injure them but when you think about things [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8130.96s)]
*  like storms like the virginia case like how do you account for i mean the amount of energy in a [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8137.84s)]
*  lightning storm is fucking insane and if they just plan it wrong which is possible something shifts [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8142.88s)]
*  i mean we're assuming they don't have control of the weather we're assuming they perhaps [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8150.64s)]
*  miscalculated or got bad data who knows or just a weird phenomenon where things i would imagine [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8156.88s)]
*  that even as technology increases there's going to be risk in everything just like with everything [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8163.360000000001s)]
*  in life with car accidents and plane crashes and i would imagine that even at super advanced [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8169.52s)]
*  alien level technology there's probably the potential for a crash all right so speaking [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8176.32s)]
*  of crash this is something i really wanted to read to your audience this is the recent uap [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8181.04s)]
*  amendment or legislation that was signed into law i'm reading this directly verbatim okay [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8186.24s)]
*  and i'd like to know what prompted this language [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8192.64s)]
*  any activity thank you senator jillibrand and rubio and others any activity or program [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8197.6s)]
*  by a department or agency of the federal government or a contractor of such a department [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8204.32s)]

*  retrieval material analysis reverse engineering research and development detection and tracking [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8217.36s)]
*  development or operational testing now that's it's right here you look it up the uap legislation [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8227.84s)]
*  what prompted that what prompted that what prompted the whistleblower stuff i mean what is the [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8235.68s)]
*  whistleblower stuff what does it say protection for individuals making authorized disclosures [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8243.36s)]

*  that congress and the senators are getting wind of what's going on why would they put that language [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8269.68s)]
*  in there reverse engineering recovered materials i mean come on man it's pretty compelling stuff [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8275.6s)]
*  well i'm sure they're hearing more than what we're hearing oh they definitely we're hearing a lot [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8283.68s)]
*  they definitely are listen if it wasn't for people like you i mean in your documentaries it just [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8288.48s)]
*  spurs so much interest and it gets people so excited that you know when i watched it i [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8294.800000000001s)]

*  time and effort especially this brazil case how do you walk away from a case like this if you think [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8437.12s)]
*  it's true if you think it's true and you're you you can't i mean you can't you must be compelled [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8442.720000000001s)]
*  it's so important you can't let it go you can't put it down it's just like you have no choice like [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8448.160000000002s)]
*  i can what am i going to do i had this guy walk up to me one time and he goes why do you do what you [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8453.36s)]
*  do you're so compelled what what gives i said well let me ask you a question if there was tangible [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8458.080000000002s)]
*  evidence being withheld i'm not i'm not saying this is a fact i'm just saying hypothetically if [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8466.48s)]
*  if this was going on and if it was being kept in the general public that there's evidence that [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8470.8s)]
*  suggests we're not alone how significant of a story would you give that and immediately he's like oh [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8475.039999999999s)]
*  my god if that was true that would be the most important thing ever i mean that's that's what we [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8481.359999999999s)]
*  all want to know and i said well i'm convinced it's happening so how do i walk away from it [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8486.08s)]
*  it's almost like what your love kills you you know well i don't think it's killing you [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8491.84s)]
*  well i think almost did with eric loaf yeah that was a sketchy scene that was sketchy scene um [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8495.92s)]
*  i think it's important and i think you should be praised and i think that if if this case is real [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8503.92s)]
*  and if these people are telling the truth and my god it certainly seems like they are [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8509.76s)]
*  it's um unbelievable i mean the the confirmation that some and what's fascinating to me is like [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8513.84s)]
*  that they're all there's a lot of variation in these things there's a lot of variation in [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8522.48s)]
*  these experiences a lot of variation these crafts and i got you got to imagine there's probably not [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8526.8s)]
*  just one world that's what i was interested in us that's what i was thinking it could be all the [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8532.24s)]
*  above it could be many worlds such a huge such a huge universe it's impossible to even wrap your [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8536.64s)]
*  mind around how big it is and if something out there is like earth where intelligent life has [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8543.92s)]
*  evolved to a very significant point but then keeps going for a thousand years 10,000 years [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8549.84s)]
*  a million years what if they live in a more stable environment where they're not getting pelted by [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8556.960000000001s)]
*  asteroids like we are neutralize the aging gene yeah what if they stop the aging process where [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8562.16s)]
*  they're not subject to the same biological ailments that we are what if they incorporate [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8567.44s)]
*  some sort of technology into their physical bodies and that's them what if you know what [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8573.68s)]
*  if they're a hybrid of of artificial intelligence and biological life like there's so many [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8579.84s)]
*  possibilities so many possibilities i mean it's almost impossible for us to even imagine the [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8584.800000000001s)]
*  variations that could be out there because you're talking about a truly infinite universe and the [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8590.64s)]
*  areas we've already identified goldilocks planets more than one multiple goldilocks planets in the [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8598.64s)]
*  known universe my son came up to me a couple days ago and he goes daddy i've been thinking a lot [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8605.2s)]
*  about this i've been thinking a lot about this i think there's those creatures that they're in [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8610.0s)]
*  virginia they came from a goldilocks zone oh it's like oh my god i just about died that's amazing so [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8614.24s)]
*  cute that is he thought about it yeah he's been thinking about it i'd like for the next generation [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8622.8s)]
*  i love the idea of like not having all this secrecy and look we know for sure there's secrecy [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8628.4s)]
*  surrounding this topic that's just a fact why why can't we just don't you think that once [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8633.679999999998s)]
*  it begins with secrecy so if you you take us back to 1947 to roswell new mexico if it begins in [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8640.48s)]
*  secrecy if the first ever crashed ufos if that begins in secrecy like what what would compel them [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8647.12s)]
*  to stop that and what how much resources would be involved in disseminating that information to the [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8655.04s)]
*  general public and why would you do that especially the way that the government has treated us always [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8661.12s)]
*  when it comes to matters of international conflict when it comes to virtually anything they lie and [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8667.92s)]
*  they always come up with a narrative that you know is very loosely based on facts and they spoon feed [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8677.2s)]
*  the american public what they want us to hear anything that would take away their agency like [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8684.0s)]
*  if you if you want to pretend that you're in control of the united states the united states [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8691.84s)]
*  is in control of the world but all of a sudden there's these beings from another planet that [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8695.44s)]
*  behave in a way and move with their crafts in a way that's impossible for us to replicate we don't [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8700.320000000002s)]
*  even understand the technology we have no idea where they're from how they got here they communicate [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8706.0s)]
*  with us telepathically i'd probably shut the fuck up too if i was the president of the united states [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8710.72s)]
*  if i was you know i just asked that very question to representative andre carson a month ago because [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8715.44s)]
*  i was curious it's like okay you guys got aro right you got all this investigations going on [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8723.2s)]
*  you got all this probe going on let's just say yeah that they make the determination after a careful [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8728.64s)]
*  review of the data the data that you and i don't have access to that some of these things represent [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8734.24s)]
*  or originate from a non-human intelligence let's just say yeah now what now does kerpatrick [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8740.0s)]
*  go to congress does he disclose that it's not his job so did he go to congress and do they disclose [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8747.52s)]
*  that well it's not really their job basically they're going to be saying we're not alone [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8753.52s)]
*  so they go to the president whatever president that is they're they're already so controversial [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8757.6s)]
*  half the country hates them so it's going to be politicized so the president can't do it and who [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8762.48s)]
*  is that what do we represent four percent of the world population so we're going to tell the rest [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8766.72s)]
*  of the world that we're not alone do we do it internationally through the united nations a [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8770.32s)]
*  panel of international scientists if that happens then we have to share all of our sensitive private [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8773.92s)]
*  data right potential materials and bodies with the rest of the world i don't see how they can do it [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8779.439999999999s)]
*  to be honest with you and i've never really thought it through like that before like think of the [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8786.32s)]
*  actual execution of disclosure how might that occur and i asked that very question to andre [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8790.8s)]
*  carson representative andre carson the other day and he's nobody's got a plan there is no plan in [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8796.88s)]
*  place wow right it's all wow yeah it's all wow i want to say one more thing there's a documentary [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8802.56s)]
*  that just came out the guy's got a totally kind of different perspective on where he puts things [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8812.8s)]
*  together but the cast of characters regarding recovered materials it's pretty compelling and [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8817.12s)]
*  it's called accidental truth by a guy named ron james and and i i watched it and again it's not [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8823.44s)]
*  my style i tend to kind of be more muted yeah accidental truth but where is it available [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8830.400000000001s)]
*  probably on itunes and amazon i'm guessing but it has the cast of characters that deal with [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8836.640000000001s)]
*  potential recovered materials and it's a little bit you know like the artwork and stuff is not [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8842.96s)]
*  my cup of tea but i did watch it and i was like oh this is interesting anyway i thought i'd [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8848.88s)]
*  mention that since we're on the topic of recovered materials so etc furthermore henceforth listen man [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8853.519999999999s)]
*  what you're doing is very important i really really believe that and thank you and if this [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8861.039999999999s)]
*  turns out to eventually get released you're a real trailblazer and i think the amount of labor and [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8865.039999999999s)]
*  just the intense focus that you put into just to make this one documentary forget about the [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8872.24s)]
*  phenomenon too it's um it's amazing stuff man i'm i'm glad you're out there appreciate you very much [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERMnvDv2exE&t=8876.88s)]
