# Joe Rogan Experience #2055 - Tim Kennedy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6.0s)]
*  Do you have anything special? Did Evan make this for you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's black rifle. I don't know what blend it is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=15.0s)]
*  Me, fully transparent. I only like the bougie black rifle blends. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=18.0s)]
*  The bougie blends? Yeah, like... [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=22.0s)]
*  Oh, like the Ethiopian stuff, like lemony sort of? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=24.0s)]
*  Evan will be like, oh, so I, you know, soul source selected this bean from this place, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=28.0s)]
*  and I roasted it this way. I'm like, oh, it's gonna be good. And it's good. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=33.0s)]
*  Well, every year I do elk hunting camp with Evan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=36.0s)]
*  We share an elk hunting camp in California. So we just got back. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=40.0s)]
*  And so Evan makes coffee for us every day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=44.0s)]
*  So he gets up and he fucking hand measures everything, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=46.0s)]
*  and he brings his own fucking special blends. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=50.0s)]
*  He had two different blends, because he knows I like a dark roast, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=53.0s)]
*  so he had a dark roast, and then he had this really bizarre, exotic coffee [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=56.0s)]
*  that tasted different than anything I'd ever had before. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=61.0s)]
*  It was like, had like a kind of like, almost like a sweet, like almost like a tea taste to it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=64.0s)]
*  Like, he just, he's a master. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=71.0s)]
*  You know, he was using tax paying dollars to start his coffee obsession. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=74.0s)]
*  Was he really? Yeah. So when he was both in group and at the agency, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=78.0s)]
*  he would take, you know, we have discretionable funds that you can spend on whenever, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=83.0s)]
*  and area improvement is an appropriate way for you to spend money. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=88.0s)]
*  So he would buy like a $20,000 espresso machine and, you know, a $3,000 grinder [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=93.0s)]
*  in some middle of nowhere Ford operating base where he's making coffee [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=99.0s)]
*  and like just being a total nerd. It's all taxpayer money. It's awesome. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=104.0s)]
*  Like finally something's being used with tax paying dollars that benefits the soldier, which is rare. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=111.0s)]
*  We ran out of coffee filters, and someone was like, well, just use paper towels. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=116.0s)]
*  And he just went, fuck no, we're not going to use paper towels. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=121.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, we're not using paper towels. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=125.0s)]
*  Look at him. He's little, but he's mighty. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=127.0s)]
*  He's very serious. Do not use paper towels. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=129.0s)]
*  Like, he's very serious about his coffee. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=132.0s)]
*  Or Scott Niven next month. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=134.0s)]
*  You've been to his place in Utah? Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=136.0s)]
*  The lab that he has set up at Black Rifle. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=138.0s)]
*  He made me do like one of the like little tastes where they like do this thing with the spoon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=140.0s)]
*  And then they have to smell it first and you have to do something with your tongue. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=145.0s)]
*  I was like, is this what are we doing here? I can't. I can't do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=149.0s)]
*  I can't go that far. It's like with wine. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=152.0s)]
*  Like when people like, oh, hints of oak. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=154.0s)]
*  Like I don't like it. I like it. Yeah. You can do that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=156.0s)]
*  This goes well with eating right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=159.0s)]
*  I have a friend, my friend Matt. I'll call. He's a real wine freak. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=161.0s)]
*  And I'll just like show him a photo of like the wine page at a restaurant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=165.0s)]
*  Like, what should I get? And he'll tell me. He'll just text me. He loves it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=169.0s)]
*  So I'm like, good. I've got that farmed off. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=172.0s)]
*  If I can outsource things that I don't have to keep on my brain. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=175.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do not want to have to pay attention to that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=179.0s)]
*  You are so good. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=181.0s)]
*  And that's how I do it with coffee too. I just like, like Evans, like I'll send you a bag of that stuff. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=182.0s)]
*  I'm like, great. What was it again? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=186.0s)]
*  I forget what it was, but it was like fruity and fucking interesting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=188.0s)]
*  Another one, like as Jack Carr is so incredible, Evan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=191.0s)]
*  So I'm skydiving all, I was supposed to be skydiving all last week, but I was in Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=194.0s)]
*  And then so I had to move it to the right because we're doing this Moab jump with a bunch of your friends, Mike Cerelli and Mike Glover and Evan. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=198.0s)]
*  And so I like, I need to brush off, knock off the dust a little bit. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=208.0s)]
*  So I, Evan, and he sends me this like super fancy designed helmet from Black Rifle, a skydive helmet, a G3 for just like, just sent it to me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=213.0s)]
*  You know, and I was like, all right, this is really cool. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, skydiving with this helmet that is way above my ability because I'm just total sky trash. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=227.0s)]
*  I have never and I'm not doing it. I have zero desire. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=233.0s)]
*  I don't get it. I don't get Andy Stump with his fucking flying squirrel suit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=237.0s)]
*  Fuck you. I hope you're doing that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=241.0s)]
*  Of course. He's he that's easy for him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=243.0s)]
*  He's used to the flying squirrel suit. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=245.0s)]
*  I think so. Regular skydiving ain't shit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=247.0s)]
*  The I asked Andy if he'd be interested in in helping me do like base jump stuff and wingsuit stuff and just all I got was no. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=250.0s)]
*  It's like, can you expand on that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=259.0s)]
*  He's like all of my friends that I used to do this with are dead. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=262.0s)]
*  So no, Tim. Okay. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=264.0s)]
*  Well, great conversation. That was fun. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=267.0s)]
*  That is like the death rate in that stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=269.0s)]
*  Like he was telling me like how many like if you send out fucking 20 people to do that, how many come back? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=273.0s)]
*  It's not good. No. Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=280.0s)]
*  You find a different hobby. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=282.0s)]
*  It's not good. Did you ever see the video where the guy is trying to fly in between the arches of a bridge? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=284.0s)]
*  The sound, the clang of metal when his meat and bones hit that bridge. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=290.0s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=298.0s)]
*  There's like a watermelon traveling at 200 miles an hour impacting metal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you can't imagine what that sound like you imagine what that sound would be until you hear it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=305.0s)]
*  And that was a watermelon with bone slamming against metal, which was a human, which is now nothing, nothing, a splatter. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=311.0s)]
*  It's instantaneous. I mean, he's probably going 100 miles an hour, you know, faster, probably. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. How fast you go with those things? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=325.0s)]
*  If 140, so like if you're in a dive position, you're going 160 to 200 miles an hour. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=327.0s)]
*  And if you're stable flying, you know, maybe 140. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah. So when you're like navigating like he was, I'm happy he was going 140, 150 miles an hour. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=341.0s)]
*  Which really makes you appreciate nature and evolution that the Perigan Falcon does like, what does it do? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=348.0s)]
*  Like 220 or something insane and can change on a dime. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=355.0s)]
*  Just like flip up to 220 horizontally. Oh, oh, fast 220 in a car fucking feels insane. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=359.0s)]
*  I've never done it. I don't know. But I mean, I've done like we went to the local racetrack that place up there, Koda. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=368.0s)]
*  Oh, our lights not on. We went to Koda recently and Koda gets up to like, I mean, we were in a Lamborghini went to like 147. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=374.0s)]
*  That feels fucking insane at a racetrack. I got this thing going. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=383.0s)]
*  You got it. You got it. Oh, there we go. Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=387.0s)]
*  That that long straightaway into that almost 180 turn on a motorcycle is one of the scariest things I have ever felt. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=389.0s)]
*  Have you done that track? Yeah. Oh, that's right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=399.0s)]
*  That was awesome. Yeah. I mean, except for that, like my testicles were up into my stomach. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I thought I'm a brave, courageous human. And I was just 100% coward on a racetrack. Right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=404.0s)]
*  Well, at least if you wipe out, you just kind of like, yeah, we were watching Formula One there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=410.0s)]
*  That is fucking wild. Those guys are flying. They're going so much faster than regular cars. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=416.0s)]
*  You really get a perspective when you've actually driven around the car in like a GT car, the track rather. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=422.0s)]
*  And then you see those guys. It's wild. Oh, and there's levels to you know, every time I think that I'm good at something, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=428.0s)]
*  then you go with somebody that's actually good at that thing. Yeah. And then you're like, I am so trash. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=435.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I knew how to drive a car until I got lessons and like, oh, I suck at driving too. Great. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=441.0s)]
*  Here's the long litany of things that I suck at. Yeah. Which are just made so clear. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=447.0s)]
*  And then unfortunately, I don't want to suck at it. So now I have this new addiction. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=452.0s)]
*  I want to go to the fucking track all the time, which is not the best thing for like time management. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=456.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it's a fucking full day thing. You know, it's like golf or something like that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=462.0s)]
*  Like I've never played golf and I won't play golf because it's a time management thing. Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=466.0s)]
*  Like I don't have that like Ron White and Tony Hinchcliffe. They go out and they play for fucking eight hours. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=470.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't have eight hours ever. Eight hours. You get stuff done on the golf course. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=474.0s)]
*  No, you don't. No, you don't. Maybe if you're a hedge fund manager and you want to figure out how to rip people off. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=479.0s)]
*  I enjoy the I'm shooting and golf have a lot in common like precision rifle. Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=485.0s)]
*  So I enjoy that portion of it. So I definitely don't need to do this other thing with a club and a ball. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=491.0s)]
*  I have a pool addiction, which is very similar. Billiards. I play I play pool at a pretty high level. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=496.0s)]
*  I have a real problem with that. I could play eight, nine hours a day. Those are easy. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=503.0s)]
*  Those are dorks. Yeah. Real pool nerds. Oh, yeah. Are they're genius. Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=508.0s)]
*  And they're weird and they're so freaking good. They're so fucking smart. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=515.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. Like really good pool players are fucking smart because you have to be because you have to it's problem solving. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=519.0s)]
*  You have to figure out how to manage geometry and also feel and then you have to execute the shot to under pressure. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=527.0s)]
*  Very similar to Jiu Jitsu in in this archery. Yeah. This physical application of this mental complex problem that is, you know, in real time changing every second. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=534.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think Jiu Jitsu is the most complex of those things and the most. But it's also the one that breaks your body the most. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=547.0s)]
*  That's the problem with Jiu Jitsu. They're really good in this long. I've totally changed now that all of these monsters have moved to Austin. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=553.0s)]
*  And what I another example of where I thought I was just this freak grappler until I met real freak grapplers. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=561.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm not even top 20. You know, I'm maybe top 100 now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=569.0s)]
*  And so that realization with the Jean-Claude Badoni's and the Gordon Rines, the Victor Hugo's, the Mary Gillies and the Craig Jones's, you know, like, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=575.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild? How many fucking people are you? Sean, she's here now too. Everyone's here. I was in his academy this morning. It's amazing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=581.0s)]
*  I mean, no, no, it's not amazing, Joe. It's not. I'm saying this is the spectrum of a great another thing that I'm trash at. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=588.0s)]
*  But I've totally changed. I want to do Jiu Jitsu until I'm 100 years old. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=595.0s)]
*  And so I am so intentional about what my roles are, who my life goes or with. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=600.0s)]
*  You know, the that's important. It's so important. And also keeping you're very good at keeping up your physical body, which a lot of people are not. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=609.0s)]
*  They just roll and they just train, which you really can't. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=616.0s)]
*  No, I split my my effort in a week almost evenly between, you know, grappling, striking, physical development, strength, speed, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=619.0s)]
*  and then like that long recovery, longevity aspect of it. Like, you know, how my week is broken into for my training. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=629.0s)]
*  You almost have to treat your body like a pit crew. You know, like you really have to change your fucking tires. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=636.0s)]
*  You got to do the whole thing. You have to. You can't just like, how do you look good? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=641.0s)]
*  No, you got to like really treat it like there's a methodical approach that must be done in order to race. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=645.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you want to train, you kind of have to do that. Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=652.0s)]
*  It's not good for the ego. I got away with it when I was 25 and fighting. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=656.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you got away with it while you're also active duty, which is pretty crazy. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=662.0s)]
*  Yeah, I should have been a little bit more intentional and disciplined about how I spent my time. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=666.0s)]
*  I took youth for granted. Everybody does. Yeah. Youth is wasted on the young. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=673.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild? Especially when you're dumb. Yeah. It's hard. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=679.0s)]
*  Well, most young people are dumb. Yeah. It's most young people that do the kind of stuff that we enjoy. Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=683.0s)]
*  We did dumb stuff. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=689.0s)]
*  How's life? Everything's good, man. Everything's really good. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=692.0s)]
*  I was shooting a bow yesterday. My buddy Tyson got Rob from ROCA, gave him a bow. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=695.0s)]
*  Another great person that does great things for people that I resent. Oh, Rob's great. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=702.0s)]
*  Yeah. You never gave me a bow. Like I was never given a bow. Like how does this just happen? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=706.0s)]
*  So he came over and... Do you want one? No, no, no. I got a great bow. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=710.0s)]
*  Where do you get a bow from? From archery country. Oh, OK. Yeah. That's my spot. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=714.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was there this morning. I got an archery country t-shirt on right here. Yeah. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=718.0s)]
*  Let's go. I got six new arrows today. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=722.0s)]
*  I shot through one of my archery targets and it hit the wood in the back and I was like inspecting my arrow. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=726.0s)]
*  And I saw like this just little tiny fine line along the side of it. And I was like, you're done. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=732.0s)]
*  Oh, carbon. Yeah. You're shooting carbon. Yeah. You got to be really careful about that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=737.0s)]
*  A lot of those explode and they go through people's hands. I can't. I love those videos. I can't watch them, but I love them. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=740.0s)]
*  Do you watch them? You do. I've seen them. Yeah. I don't enjoy them. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=745.0s)]
*  I check all my shit up religiously though because of that. I used to. I had a Teflon glove that I tried to wear for a while. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=748.0s)]
*  A lot of guys wear a Teflon glove to make sure that never happens. But it's like it's never happened to me. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=754.0s)]
*  I've been shooting a bow for 10 years. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. It's great. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=759.0s)]
*  I've built about 180 degree 3D archery range in the backyard and back three acres. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=763.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got full size elk and pigs and coyotes and a bunch of little deer. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=769.0s)]
*  So anywhere from a hundred yards. I hate that I have to say yards instead of meters. Yeah, we should have changed over. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=775.0s)]
*  We almost did when I was in like, I guess I was in high school and they're trying to change everybody over. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=782.0s)]
*  It's just so much easier. It makes more sense. America's so fucked up with that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=786.0s)]
*  We're like, nah, fuck the rest of the world. Inches, bitch. We made it to the moon off inches and feet. Great. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=790.0s)]
*  Thanks. It's a long time ago. Fuck soccer. Yeah. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=797.0s)]
*  The rest of the world is like on the metric system. Like, I love how England still sticks with power. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=801.0s)]
*  They do stone. They're still with the stone thing. Dumbest unit of measurement. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=808.0s)]
*  When we used to do fights over there and I had to do the weigh-ins, I used to have to say stone as well as pounds. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=813.0s)]
*  It's like, OK, why are we doing that? Is this confusing when I just say pounds? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=819.0s)]
*  It's confusing enough when we have to throw on how much somebody weighs in kilos and then how much they weigh in pounds. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=824.0s)]
*  And we throw in stones. Yeah. And we're just like, OK. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=829.0s)]
*  Kilos, Celsius, all that. Like I was watching this video this guy was talking about. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=832.0s)]
*  Well, it's 30 degrees out, so it's a nice day to go out and shoot. I was like, 30 degrees. I was like, oh, he's in Canada. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=835.0s)]
*  All right. OK. You communist. Using that bullshit metric system. They really are right now, too. They are. They're full on. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=842.0s)]
*  I never thought it would happen that fast. Bro, it's so bad. I'm worried that my podcast is going to be censored in Canada because it's going to pass some new fucking legislation where they're allowed to. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=849.0s)]
*  Is it like the whole idea is like it's under the guise of Canadian content because they have a Canadian content law where they like you have to have a certain amount of Canadian based content on like the radio and television and stuff like that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=860.0s)]
*  You can't just have all stuff from all over the world, whatever people like. You have to have like a certain percentage of it has to be Canadian. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=874.0s)]
*  And so under the guise of that, but really it's true dough trying to enforce censorship on podcasts because they always do it in the cover and every dangerous. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=880.0s)]
*  Freedom censoring group does it under this idea of they're doing it for the greater good. Yes. You know, it's like whether it's diversity, equity and inclusion or it's making sure that not disinformation or misinformation is being populated within the masses. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=895.0s)]
*  It's always through this veil of no, no, it's for your benefit, but you pull the veil back a little bit and you it's just censorship. It's just control. Yeah, they're just trying to manipulate what information is available for people to to try to base their opinions off. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=910.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that video of true dough from like 10 years ago? I mean, it might have been for more. But I really 2010 and he's talking about how he's opposed to you got coffee in there. Yeah. Salute. My friend. Cheers. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=925.0s)]
*  He's opposed to regulations with guns because he's like regulations are the first step that they take and the ultimate goal is to remove your gun. So we will not have regulations. Yes. Like he's talking about this like in 2010 or 2011. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=939.0s)]
*  I mean, he was following a playbook. So he absolutely didn't believe that though, because he knew that in, you know, within a decade, he would be trying to confiscate every single gun that he could get his hands on and make transfer of pistols illegal, illegal. It's illegal. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=954.0s)]
*  Yeah, if I have a pistol, and I want to sell you a pistol. I cannot. That's it. So wild. It's so wild how quick it changed over there. They use COVID to just enforce the sweeping legislation across all sectors. They don't have a free speech. They don't have a First Amendment over there. So they have hate speech laws which can be interpreted so vaguely. And this is what Jordan Peterson was rallying against like back when they had this big, big gun. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=969.0s)]
*  was rallying against, like, back when they had this bill [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=996.0s)]
*  that was set up to make people use someone's gender identity. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=999.5s)]
*  And he was like, what gender identity are you talking about? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1005.14s)]
*  There's 78 current gender identities [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1008.14s)]
*  that someone can choose to identify with, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1011.38s)]
*  including just complete nonsense, made-up words, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1014.18s)]
*  and it's gonna keep going. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1017.48s)]
*  I don't know how many of them there are now. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1018.92s)]
*  But he was like, the only way you enforce this is with... [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1020.36s)]
*  You're gonna have to use force. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1023.56s)]
*  And it's like the rule of law. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1025.86s)]
*  Now it's like you're gonna send armed thugs [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1027.56s)]
*  to arrest people for not using made-up words. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1030.3s)]
*  Like, this is where this goes. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1033.04s)]
*  Especially Peterson, who knows so much about communism [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1035.0s)]
*  and so much about where... [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1038.1s)]
*  The darkness that it leads down to. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  I love that he approaches it both from, like, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1043.08s)]
*  a philosophical perspective and a historical perspective. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1045.28s)]
*  You know, he is so well versed and knowledgeable, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1047.9199999999998s)]
*  and the argument that they're making from this position, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1051.26s)]
*  this is where it leads to. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1055.86s)]
*  And not only do we understand this in human nature, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1057.46s)]
*  and here's a bunch of examples of it, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1059.56s)]
*  but then also historically, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1061.02s)]
*  here's a bunch of examples of it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1062.56s)]
*  So it makes it really hard to dispute [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1064.36s)]
*  what is really logical and rational. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1066.6s)]
*  And, okay, if you're here [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1069.2s)]
*  and they wanna go from point A to point B, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1070.64s)]
*  this is the process for them to get there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1072.14s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, another brilliant man [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1074.54s)]
*  that does a lot of good. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1077.24s)]
*  Well, you need a guy like him [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1078.08s)]
*  who has such a deep understanding of history [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1079.6399999999999s)]
*  and also is a clinical psychologist [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1082.28s)]
*  who understands the human mind on a very, very deep level. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1085.1799999999998s)]
*  So he can explain things in a way [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1088.12s)]
*  that is almost impossible to refute. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1090.62s)]
*  Like, he's got all his bases covered [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1093.56s)]
*  when he had discussed the subject, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  and he can fucking pull it off of his head. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  The guy uses no notes, and he just will quote things [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1100.4399999999998s)]
*  and explain things in the most complex manner [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1103.4599999999998s)]
*  and make it absorbable to everybody. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1107.04s)]
*  Yeah, he and I are, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1110.4s)]
*  we're in a parallel fight right now on the education side. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1112.6s)]
*  I have Apogee, which is, I have a physical school here, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1116.44s)]
*  and we have online mentorship, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1119.08s)]
*  and we're launching an additional 50 schools this year. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1120.44s)]
*  Started a big, huge foundation, the Apogee Foundation, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  all just to turn this public school problem on its ear [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1125.88s)]
*  as we've indoctrinated this entire generation [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1129.96s)]
*  to hate America. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1132.46s)]
*  And we're in a really scary position. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1134.34s)]
*  Military's having recruiting issues, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  we're having identity problems in every imaginable way [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1140.9599999999998s)]
*  with this Gen Z and millennials [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1143.7199999999998s)]
*  just not knowing what their purpose is. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1145.6599999999999s)]
*  And when you look at the public school system [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1148.06s)]
*  and the Department of Education, it's just a broken system. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1150.36s)]
*  Teachers are great, most of them on majority, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  I think have a real pure heart to do good, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1156.9599999999998s)]
*  but they're in a system that is forcing them [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1160.5s)]
*  or they're allowing to manipulate kids [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1163.92s)]
*  to radicalize them into really anti-American ideas. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1166.16s)]
*  And something has to change [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1170.0200000000002s)]
*  because the current trajectory, we're screwed. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1172.16s)]
*  The lack of individual responsibility [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1178.6000000000001s)]
*  and as Jocko would say, extreme ownership [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1181.68s)]
*  of what the issues are and how to solve them [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1184.3400000000001s)]
*  are absolutely absent. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1187.0s)]
*  We have entitlement, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  we have accepting these identities, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1191.0s)]
*  we have obviously this mental health crisis [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1194.18s)]
*  and all of it really goes back [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1196.84s)]
*  when you look at the pandering [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1198.18s)]
*  that is happening in public schools [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1200.24s)]
*  for eight hours in a day, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1201.58s)]
*  there's no way that you could come out of that process [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1203.48s)]
*  not being jacked up. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1206.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1207.9s)]
*  You're gonna get some of it's gonna leak into your brain [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1208.98s)]
*  no matter how much your parents talk to you [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1211.7s)]
*  or no matter how much you have your own ideas about life, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1213.5s)]
*  there's a certain amount that people just absorb [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1218.62s)]
*  from their atmosphere and accept. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a certain amount of it that people just accept. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1222.96s)]
*  And it's so manipulative when a third grade teacher [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1225.28s)]
*  is assigning you a project of, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1228.24s)]
*  okay, you are a Palestinian freedom fighter [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1230.56s)]
*  here in the United States, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1232.9199999999998s)]
*  what are some ways that you can help the Palestinians [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1234.24s)]
*  in Gaza be free? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1237.9399999999998s)]
*  Like that is your assignment, give me five examples [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1240.2s)]
*  or even better, you'll get five points [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1242.72s)]
*  for extracurricular activities [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1244.56s)]
*  where you went and did something to help [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1247.52s)]
*  at a Palestinian protest or pro Palestinian. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1250.36s)]
*  And it's just like, you've effectively radicalized a kid [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1252.9799999999998s)]
*  into a freedom fighter with one assignment. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1256.1799999999998s)]
*  Like they have no choice but to participate [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1258.54s)]
*  if they wanna receive good grade. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1260.26s)]
*  That was on the news yesterday, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1263.4599999999998s)]
*  that exact situation was happening and it's detestable. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1264.62s)]
*  It's so bizarre. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1269.1s)]
*  It's so bizarre that people don't see where this goes. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1270.74s)]
*  They don't see the end of it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1275.02s)]
*  And it's not to say that the plight [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1276.58s)]
*  of the innocent Palestinians [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1278.9s)]
*  is not a terrible situation to be in. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1280.3000000000002s)]
*  If you're stuck in Gaza under the rule of Hamas [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1283.0s)]
*  and then you have Israel just like detained, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1285.94s)]
*  keeps everybody detained in this one area, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1288.0600000000002s)]
*  it's not good for them either. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1290.7800000000002s)]
*  2.4 million people in an area the side of Washington DC. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1292.2800000000002s)]
*  And I like to use the word stuck because they are. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1296.7800000000002s)]
*  We have 240 hostages that are in Gaza, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1299.74s)]
*  like legitimate Israeli American, Brazilian, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1303.02s)]
*  from almost every single nation. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1307.02s)]
*  There's hostages in Gaza currently from October 7th. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1309.74s)]
*  But the 2.4 million people, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1313.3s)]
*  the Palestinians that live in Gaza, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1315.44s)]
*  they are being held hostage by 30 to 40,000 radical Hamas [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1317.06s)]
*  and about seven other radical organizations [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1321.26s)]
*  that are terrorist organizations. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1324.06s)]
*  So your word stuck could not be more accurate. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1326.12s)]
*  There are great, peaceful, wonderful Muslims in Gaza [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1328.2s)]
*  that voted in a terrorist organization [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1332.66s)]
*  when the PLO and Hamas were trying to figure out [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1335.72s)]
*  who is actually gonna be the ruling party [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1337.88s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1339.4s)]
*  Hamas won out and now they are the size of a cartel [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1341.32s)]
*  being funded $70 million a year from Iran [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1346.32s)]
*  is being pumped into Hamas. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1349.76s)]
*  And all they're doing is taking every little bit [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1351.92s)]
*  of humanitarian aid and converting it [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1355.0s)]
*  into military resources. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1356.72s)]
*  And those poor people, those poor Palestinians [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1358.28s)]
*  are trapped in between all of this. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1360.64s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1363.04s)]
*  It's such a complex problem that is solvable, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1364.04s)]
*  but like it's heartbreaking [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1367.84s)]
*  when you look at the individual level [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1369.2s)]
*  of the kids that are there and the women that are there [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1372.04s)]
*  and the civilians that are there are literally trapped, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  as you said, stuck. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1376.2s)]
*  And if you're Israel, how do you fix it? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1377.8s)]
*  If you're Palestinian, how do you fix it? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1380.44s)]
*  When it's so evident that Hamas wants one thing, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1382.44s)]
*  which is the elimination and genocide of all Jews. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1385.0s)]
*  And are there any Muslim countries [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1389.22s)]
*  that are accepting Palestinian refugees? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1391.84s)]
*  No, they never have. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  That seems insane because there's all this support [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1395.8s)]
*  for the Palestinians. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1399.8s)]
*  If you're Islamic, if you're a Muslim [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1401.4399999999998s)]
*  and you want to support these Muslims, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1404.28s)]
*  wouldn't you support the idea that your country, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1409.9199999999998s)]
*  this Muslim country would accept those people [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1412.76s)]
*  and they could be in a place where they could be free? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1415.12s)]
*  Yeah, 22 Arab nations, over 40 Muslim nations [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1417.48s)]
*  internationally, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1420.96s)]
*  There's one Jew nation and that one Jew nation, Israel, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1422.08s)]
*  has done more for the Palestinian people [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1425.64s)]
*  than any other nation ever. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1427.2s)]
*  So it's ludicrous and it's insulting [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1429.44s)]
*  to the Palestinian people to start throwing stones at Israel [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1432.0s)]
*  when in fact they're the only group [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1434.8s)]
*  that has been trying to protect [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1435.96s)]
*  and in any administrative way provide food, water [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1437.48s)]
*  and resources to the people that are there. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1440.44s)]
*  Over 40 Muslim countries, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1443.48s)]
*  not one of them is accepting any Palestinian refugees. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1445.4s)]
*  What is the answer to that? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1448.72s)]
*  Like why? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1450.72s)]
*  They're a problem that is with the radicals [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1452.68s)]
*  that are embedded inside of them. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1457.9s)]
*  How do you differentiate between [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1459.52s)]
*  who is a peaceful Muslim Palestinian [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1461.82s)]
*  to who is a radical that is working for Hamas? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1464.3600000000001s)]
*  Like how do you do that? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1467.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1470.44s)]
*  So as I'm getting evacuation requests two weeks ago [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1471.28s)]
*  and we're trying to be good, proper, judicious servants, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1475.74s)]
*  how do I know that this name of this person [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1482.82s)]
*  is not trying to fill out an evacuation form [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1486.98s)]
*  to be assisted to move from an area [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1490.26s)]
*  that they're currently denied in [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1491.98s)]
*  where their area of movement is restricted [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1493.98s)]
*  for any other reasons besides that they need help? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1497.5s)]
*  Like it's a really hard multiple levels of truth [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1500.16s)]
*  to try to peel back to figure out who some of these people are [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1504.46s)]
*  and what their intentions are. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1508.06s)]
*  And it's been that way for a really long time. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1509.6200000000001s)]
*  If you go all the way back to like 1987 [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1511.6200000000001s)]
*  when Hamas really started moving and fighting with the PLO [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1513.42s)]
*  for control the era, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1516.46s)]
*  you know, when Yasser Arafat was meeting with Clinton [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1517.5s)]
*  and the prime minister of Israel [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1520.82s)]
*  and they're making negotiations in Oslo [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1522.6200000000001s)]
*  and all the way up to the first Intifada, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  to the second Intifada, to then all suicide attacks, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  pizzerias blowing up. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1530.74s)]
*  Like how do you determine who is good and who's bad? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1532.3799999999999s)]
*  Do they have a suicide vest? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1535.78s)]
*  Do they not? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1537.1399999999999s)]
*  Or like what are their intentions? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1537.98s)]
*  It's wildly hard. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1539.3799999999999s)]
*  You have been involved just in the last few years [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1541.8999999999999s)]
*  in two of the most heartbreaking scenes [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1545.62s)]
*  that we've seen depicted in the media. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1549.34s)]
*  The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1552.34s)]
*  you leave that and now you just got back from Israel. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1558.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1559.74s)]
*  I'm over what's happened the past three years. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1560.58s)]
*  There's actually four consecutive. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1562.6599999999999s)]
*  So the day I got back from Afghanistan, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1564.62s)]
*  because I went from Afghanistan to Albanian, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1566.98s)]
*  Brazil and Italy and Greece [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1569.46s)]
*  to try to have them take refugees. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1570.6599999999999s)]
*  So my post Afghanistan work lasted a few more weeks [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1572.3799999999999s)]
*  because there were a lot of Afghan refugees [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1579.98s)]
*  and non-American citizens that weren't even Afghanis [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1582.02s)]
*  that we had to figure out where we're going to put. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1585.5s)]
*  So that carried off, you know, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1587.4199999999998s)]
*  the attack happened September 26 where, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1588.98s)]
*  or August 26 where the bomb at Abbey Gate went off [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1592.18s)]
*  and the American service members were killed. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1594.94s)]
*  And, you know, we left a few days later. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1597.46s)]
*  Two weeks later, we're now into mid September. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1600.8200000000002s)]
*  I come back and I immediately, the day I land, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1603.1000000000001s)]
*  I get assigned to go down to the Mexican border. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1605.78s)]
*  And I spent six months on the Mexican border [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1608.1000000000001s)]
*  on Operation Lone Star, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1610.8600000000001s)]
*  part of a special operation task force [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1612.46s)]
*  combating cartels, traffickers, human traffickers, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1615.18s)]
*  drug smugglers. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1617.9s)]
*  So there was humanitarian crisis number two in my life [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1619.46s)]
*  in three years, which was the Mexican border. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1622.66s)]
*  Some of the worst stuff I've ever seen in my life. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1624.98s)]
*  On par with Afghanistan, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1626.94s)]
*  on par with what was the next one, which was Ukraine. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1628.8200000000002s)]
*  The day I got off orders, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1631.74s)]
*  where I was legally allowed to travel or I was not. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1633.46s)]
*  So when you're on orders, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1635.94s)]
*  you have to do what the army says, right? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1636.7800000000002s)]
*  And the army said, this is what you're going to do. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1638.66s)]
*  So for six months, I was on this assignment at the border. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1640.46s)]
*  The day I got off those orders, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1643.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm back to a civilian Tim Kennedy. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1645.1000000000001s)]
*  So then I traveled to Ukraine. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1647.74s)]
*  I worked Ukraine for a few months during that conflict [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1649.82s)]
*  and post invasion, which was again, horrible. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1654.78s)]
*  Like some of the worst stuff I've ever seen. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1659.54s)]
*  Come back and I get this like momentary lull, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1661.6200000000001s)]
*  where I was like, I think like Israel, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1664.14s)]
*  is this going to be okay? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1667.46s)]
*  And then this happens, you know, then October 7th happens. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1668.3s)]
*  And it was just in three years for this level of, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1671.82s)]
*  horror to happen is, it's indescribable. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1678.42s)]
*  It seems like it's ramping up. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1681.58s)]
*  It is. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1683.58s)]
*  So you're saying that the experience that you had [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1685.9s)]
*  at the border was as bad as anything. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1687.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1690.78s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean, this is, I'm not going to, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1692.02s)]
*  you're not going to give me, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1695.1s)]
*  I'm just going to take a sip here. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1695.94s)]
*  So we're in Afghanistan, right? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1699.5s)]
*  Babies are stuck in Constantine wire. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1701.26s)]
*  Taliban is executing civilians in the street [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1704.7s)]
*  to try to prompt Americans to do a response, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1708.18s)]
*  trying to elicit some escalation, right? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1710.8600000000001s)]
*  They're really just flexing to show [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1714.7s)]
*  that they were in charge. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1716.26s)]
*  So that's Afghanistan on the ground, burnt babies. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1717.42s)]
*  You know, as I'm going out to try and find Americans [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1719.7s)]
*  or our allies that are out in the city of Kabul [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1722.02s)]
*  to bring them into HKIA, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1725.06s)]
*  and you're stepping over like small burnt babies, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1727.3400000000001s)]
*  like it's the worst thing ever. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1729.14s)]
*  Fast forward three weeks, we're at the Del Rio river, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1731.78s)]
*  and there are 400 immigrants trying to cross the river. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1736.18s)]
*  They have babies up on their shoulders, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1740.42s)]
*  and the coyotes, the traffickers, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1742.18s)]
*  every single person that's in the river has paid [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1744.1000000000001s)]
*  the cartels to be escorted across the border. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1746.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, concurrently, the cartel is about to smuggle [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1750.1000000000001s)]
*  500 meters up the river, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1753.54s)]
*  two dudes with bundles of fentanyl on their back. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1755.5800000000002s)]
*  So I'm dealing with this gigantic humanitarian problem [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1758.46s)]
*  of a few hundred people at night trying to cross [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1761.1000000000001s)]
*  a dark, cold, flowing water with babies on their shoulders. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1764.54s)]
*  And what do the coyotes do? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1768.9s)]
*  The moment that they start getting close to the shore, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1770.1s)]
*  they just grab the kids, down in the drink, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1771.82s)]
*  down in the water. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1775.26s)]
*  Babies are floating, little children are screaming. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1776.42s)]
*  Why would they do this? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1779.26s)]
*  Because I have to spend resources of my personnel to flood [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1780.46s)]
*  to try to save these immigrants from drowning in the river. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1784.22s)]
*  And I have to throw a ton of resources and people at them [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1788.82s)]
*  to try and save them so they don't die in the river. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1791.86s)]
*  At the exact same time, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1794.6599999999999s)]
*  the resources that I have to use personnel-wise here, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1796.86s)]
*  they're getting guys successfully onto the shore [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1799.9399999999998s)]
*  with bags full of fentanyl as they run into the inland, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1801.86s)]
*  into the interior. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1805.2199999999998s)]
*  And they know exactly what they're doing. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1807.62s)]
*  They're making money by moving people [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1809.4599999999998s)]
*  while they're concurrently making money smuggling drugs [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1810.9799999999998s)]
*  and throwing humanitarian crises at us [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1813.1399999999999s)]
*  so that they can move drugs simultaneously. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1815.1799999999998s)]
*  And that's hard for people that are trying to do good. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1818.46s)]
*  How do you choose which problem to attack? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1823.58s)]
*  We had a service member that dived into the water [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1828.06s)]
*  to try to save a baby and he drowned. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1829.94s)]
*  Took us a week to find his body. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1833.18s)]
*  A Texas National Guardsman dove in there [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1835.66s)]
*  to try to find a baby that had got pushed off. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1838.58s)]
*  And he drowned trying to save her. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1841.8600000000001s)]
*  Is it a matter of resources? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1845.74s)]
*  Are not enough resources being put into? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1848.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, obviously this whole thing reeks of, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1850.9s)]
*  it's so terrible to say, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1855.18s)]
*  but it seems like this is a concentrated effort [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1856.94s)]
*  and not just from the cartel. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1862.18s)]
*  It seems like this is something [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1864.14s)]
*  that's being allowed to happen. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1865.46s)]
*  The benefit of, there's lots, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1869.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's a hard question. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1872.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1873.74s)]
*  Texas has a way different position [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1875.38s)]
*  than the federal government as to the immigration problem. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1877.7s)]
*  And their approach are almost in conflict. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1880.66s)]
*  So when you get to the real bad actors [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1883.82s)]
*  with sexual trafficking cartel members, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1886.94s)]
*  drug smugglers, weapon smugglers, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1893.18s)]
*  of course you're gonna see federal assets [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1895.94s)]
*  being leveraged to attack those problem sets. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1898.26s)]
*  But the large humanitarian problem, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1901.06s)]
*  the federal government is gonna have [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1905.26s)]
*  a way different approach compared to the Texas government. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1906.7s)]
*  The Texas government is like, no, this is illegal immigration. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1909.78s)]
*  We have lawful ports of entry. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1912.9s)]
*  You have to legally come into the United States [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1915.42s)]
*  through a legal port of entry. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1917.74s)]
*  And then once you are here, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1919.14s)]
*  we will process you in accordance with [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1920.5s)]
*  what the department of state says the immigration process is. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1922.94s)]
*  Cause there's a rule and we're a country of laws. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1926.42s)]
*  So you have to follow the law. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1928.8600000000001s)]
*  Anything else is illegal. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1930.46s)]
*  The other side of that coin is the federal approach, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1932.22s)]
*  which is anybody that makes across the border, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1936.74s)]
*  you are now here and we're gonna process you, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1938.94s)]
*  which is insanity. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1942.7s)]
*  Why do they do that? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1944.38s)]
*  Do you think they're trying to bring in voters? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1949.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1951.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1953.74s)]
*  It grows the government. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1954.74s)]
*  It's more entitled people that you have to pay, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  more entitlement programs that you have to pay to support. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1959.5s)]
*  Those people are immediately shipped into the interior. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1962.3400000000001s)]
*  I find it comical and I know people think [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1965.82s)]
*  it's not appropriate for the Texas government. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1968.94s)]
*  They've been shipping immigrants [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1971.3s)]
*  to some of these sanctuary cities [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1973.02s)]
*  that they have said that they're sanctuary cities [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1975.98s)]
*  until they've actually received a lot of immigrants. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1978.98s)]
*  And they're like, oh my God, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1981.22s)]
*  we can't handle this number of immigrants. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1982.06s)]
*  And it's like 1% of what comes over the border [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1983.82s)]
*  every single day here in Texas [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1986.66s)]
*  that we have to deal with all the time. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1987.82s)]
*  The Yankees, those North, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1990.4199999999998s)]
*  they have no idea what it's like to be a border state. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1992.46s)]
*  And the amount, just the tens and hundreds of thousands [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1995.4199999999998s)]
*  of people that are coming across every single day, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=1998.8999999999999s)]
*  it's criminal that they're allowing it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2005.8999999999999s)]
*  And when did it start? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2007.98s)]
*  When did it ramp up like this? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2009.58s)]
*  This was never- [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2011.82s)]
*  Three years ago. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2012.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2015.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Trump put some pretty powerful laws in place [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2017.3s)]
*  and empowered the federal immigration laws [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2020.94s)]
*  for us at the border to have lots of tools. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2025.26s)]
*  To one, turn somebody away. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2028.46s)]
*  If you're coming across and you're claiming asylum, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2030.7s)]
*  well, you have to go back to your country of origin, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2032.9s)]

*  The men and women, border patrol, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2080.5400000000004s)]

*  And that's a really hard thing to reconcile, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2105.06s)]
*  is what is the humane thing to do? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2108.7s)]

*  obviously is just going to be a drop in a bucket [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2151.78s)]
*  of those that have made it across. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2153.86s)]
*  And it is in light of what just happened in Israel, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2155.86s)]
*  where they flew paragliders over borders, over walls, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2162.5800000000004s)]

*  So you're a pastor and you wanna go to the Jordan River [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2372.3s)]
*  because that's where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2378.06s)]
*  You are a Muslim and you wanna go to the Dome, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2381.18s)]

*  you want to go to the mosque that they're calling, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2386.9s)]
*  the reason for attacking Israel was because they thought [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2392.7000000000003s)]
*  it was gonna be destroyed, which it never will be. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2395.14s)]
*  It's protected by Israel. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2397.02s)]
*  Whatever your motivation was, you get there, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2399.1800000000003s)]
*  you're an American, and then this attack happens. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2400.78s)]
*  American cancels your flight, United cancels your flight. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2405.06s)]

*  And the only airline left is the Israeli airline. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2410.3s)]
*  Wherever you are in Israel, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2414.54s)]
*  maybe you're on the Jordan River, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2416.06s)]
*  maybe you're up north in the Haifa, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2417.18s)]
*  maybe you're like way down south in a lot [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2418.46s)]
*  because you wanted to see the border of Egypt [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2420.86s)]
*  and this, you know, you're the Gulf of Aqaba. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2422.78s)]
*  It's like the most beautiful water [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2424.86s)]
*  that connects to the Red Sea. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2426.1s)]
*  And you're an American tourist. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2429.9s)]
*  You don't have the wherewithal of knowing how to travel [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2434.2599999999998s)]
*  in the middle of a war. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2437.74s)]

*  for us to be able to help you get out. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2446.94s)]
*  From where you are as an American citizen [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2449.7s)]
*  to where you need to be to get out of this country [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2451.58s)]
*  where 1,400 people are being raped, murdered, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2453.46s)]
*  burnt alive, tortured. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2456.14s)]
*  There's people being kidnapped and hostages being taken. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2457.7799999999997s)]
*  And like, you're just an American that's now stuck here. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2460.86s)]
*  And every single airline has canceled your flight [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2463.18s)]
*  no matter how many times you've booked it. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2464.86s)]
*  Maybe we had this guy had booked five new flights [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2466.46s)]
*  and every single one of those flights [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2470.02s)]
*  had been charged on his credit card. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2471.18s)]
*  And so then his credit card is frozen [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2473.26s)]
*  because he's just booked five next day flights [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2475.98s)]
*  at three, $4,000 a piece. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2479.6600000000003s)]
*  And he's on heart medication, maybe he's on insulin, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2482.2200000000003s)]
*  whatever the individual. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2485.5s)]
*  We helped almost 400 people get out of Israel. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2486.9s)]
*  But the Department of State, as amazing as there are, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2490.6200000000003s)]
*  there's these little gaps that somebody has to go [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2493.2200000000003s)]
*  and help them with that's comfortable moving [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2495.98s)]
*  in the middle of a war. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2498.34s)]
*  And that's really where Save Our Allies comes in [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2499.82s)]
*  because we go and fill that gap. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2503.1s)]
*  Like, how do I find this guy in this hotel [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2505.02s)]
*  that is too scared to leave, doesn't know how to get a bus, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2507.34s)]
*  doesn't know how to get a taxi, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2510.42s)]
*  doesn't know how to, his tourist information [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2511.7400000000002s)]
*  or his tourist guide is like, hey bro, I'm out. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2514.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna go down because my kabut's just got murdered. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2516.42s)]
*  I'm gonna go help my family that, you know, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2519.06s)]
*  they're missing three of their family members. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2520.86s)]
*  Of course they're gonna go and help. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2522.86s)]
*  But now that guy is stuck, that his family's stuck, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2524.2200000000003s)]
*  that pastor's stuck. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2526.58s)]
*  So we had to go and find those people [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2528.1s)]
*  and move them to a place where they could get out [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2530.46s)]
*  of the country safely. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2533.38s)]
*  And it was fricking hard. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2534.9s)]
*  The volume of that is like wild. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2537.58s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2541.1s)]
*  We took this rad two pastors, they're from California [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2543.62s)]
*  and we had a similar situation. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2548.9s)]
*  They'd booked multiple flights. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2551.98s)]
*  They had an old pastor with them. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2554.18s)]
*  You know, they didn't have the maneuverability [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2557.26s)]
*  of being able to pivot with whatever existing flights. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2559.5s)]
*  Ultimately, we had to drive them from where they were [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2562.7400000000002s)]
*  to Haifa to put them on a private chartered airplane [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2566.26s)]
*  to fly them from Haifa to Cyprus, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2570.34s)]
*  where they could then fly from there to Athens and get home. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  Like we had to privately source an airplane [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2575.42s)]
*  to fly them out of a place, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2578.02s)]
*  to get them to a place that they could fly out of [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2579.94s)]
*  because all other aircraft had been grounded. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2581.78s)]
*  So that two pastors could make it back to their churches [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2586.2200000000003s)]
*  in California, you know, they're literally stuck. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2588.5s)]
*  So, yeah, crazy. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2592.26s)]
*  How do you fucking manage your mind [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2595.86s)]
*  dealing with so many horrific and traumatic experiences [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2599.98s)]
*  over and over and over again, just over a few years? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2604.02s)]
*  That's what my dad just asked me. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2607.66s)]
*  But he asked me like way more pointed. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2609.66s)]
*  He's like, are you okay? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2611.14s)]
*  Are you okay, son? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2612.86s)]
*  Yeah, I would be asking that too if I was your dad. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2613.78s)]
*  Do you remember Mr. Rogers? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2618.74s)]
*  We're old. Yes, yeah, sure. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2619.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2621.46s)]
*  He was asked a real similar question. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2623.78s)]
*  And it was during the civil rights protests [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2625.7s)]
*  where blacks are being beaten in the street, you know, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2628.78s)]
*  and hippies are being condemned as like the next plague [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2632.38s)]
*  and pestilence that society could ever see. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2636.86s)]
*  And like, what would you do with all of this evil [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2639.66s)]
*  happening around us? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2642.5s)]
*  And Mr. Rogers says, just look to the helpers. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2643.9s)]
*  There's always people trying to help. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2647.7s)]
*  And, you know, I'm thinking about the ground team [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2650.14s)]
*  that I had with me over there. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2654.1s)]
*  I can't even say their names because they're amazing people, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2656.2999999999997s)]
*  but we had JP, RT, Primo, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2659.66s)]
*  and the most brilliant from the expeditionary [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2663.9399999999996s)]
*  special operations backgrounds, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2668.8599999999997s)]
*  but the most selfless, hardworking, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2671.1s)]
*  they're giants of humans. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2674.8599999999997s)]
*  Like I look at them just in awe of how capable they are [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2676.74s)]
*  and how selfless they are at the same time. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2680.4599999999996s)]
*  Like these are the most lethal humans on the planet [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2682.14s)]
*  and they could kill you a thousand different ways, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2684.74s)]
*  but they're putting their lives on the line [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2686.8999999999996s)]
*  to try and rescue a pastor that can't book a flight. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2688.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, like Israel would do anything [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2694.18s)]
*  to have one of these guys go with them and advise them [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2696.3399999999997s)]
*  about how to get into this shit show that is Gaza, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2699.18s)]
*  into the tunnels that are controlled by Hamas. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2702.66s)]
*  And what are we going to do with Hezbollah [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2704.7s)]
*  at the Northern border? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2706.02s)]
*  How are we going to stop the Taliban [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2706.86s)]
*  that just got permission to cross through Iraq? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2708.2599999999998s)]
*  What are we going to do with Al-Qaeda [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2710.06s)]
*  that just bribed a whole bunch more people [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2711.2599999999998s)]
*  to fly them into every single neighboring country? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2713.34s)]
*  Like, but instead they're just trying to rescue people. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2715.18s)]
*  So to ask you a question, when I'm down at the border, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2718.74s)]
*  I just look to my left or my right [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2723.1s)]
*  and I see a freaking private that's three o'clock [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2724.22s)]
*  in the morning, he's sitting there with night vision [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2727.34s)]
*  and he's like, that kid just fell in the water [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2729.38s)]
*  and the motherfucker's off. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2732.02s)]
*  He's off, he's running down into the darkness [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2733.62s)]
*  to jump in the water to try and save a kid. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2735.86s)]
*  Like if you cannot find inspiration from that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2738.54s)]
*  and if you cannot find something that's going to nurture [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2741.38s)]
*  and feed your soul and inspire you [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2743.34s)]
*  to do something good for the people around you. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2744.9s)]
*  And look at the guys that I had with me in Israel. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2747.02s)]
*  Like I can't even, the group of people [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2748.54s)]
*  that I had with me in Ukraine, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2751.26s)]
*  like I'm just astounded by these. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2752.3s)]
*  And you know a whole bunch of them too [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2754.5s)]
*  that are just amazing people. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2757.02s)]
*  I've been so blessed to have, you know, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2760.46s)]
*  a short but successful fighting career, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2764.3s)]
*  a successful military career that then went into a period [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2766.42s)]
*  of like successful business. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2769.26s)]
*  And now I'm in a position where like, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2771.1000000000004s)]
*  man I really want to do good [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2773.26s)]
*  and there's all these things that I know [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2774.9s)]
*  or people are really hurting in or they can't do. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2776.6200000000003s)]
*  And I have experienced in a background and connections [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2778.94s)]
*  that I'm able to solve these problems. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2781.9s)]
*  I did so much evil, I dealt so much death. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2784.38s)]
*  If I didn't try to do good now, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2787.98s)]
*  like I think I would really have a problem. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2790.38s)]
*  But I'm good because I'm doing good. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2794.6200000000003s)]
*  There's something about that, doing good for other people. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2797.5800000000004s)]
*  Like when you're hurting, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2800.5s)]
*  I don't think there's anything more important [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2801.86s)]
*  that you could do than do something for somebody else. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2803.42s)]
*  And that man, that just empowers you [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2807.1800000000003s)]
*  and it gives you purpose. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2809.1400000000003s)]
*  And if I'm ever gonna think about, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2811.26s)]
*  should I get up and work out today? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2815.5s)]
*  Well, I can think about August 24th, 2021, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2817.3s)]
*  when I had two kids in my arms and a woman behind me [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2821.1800000000003s)]
*  and we're having to run through Kabul [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2824.94s)]
*  to try to make it to Aitchikaya [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2825.7799999999997s)]
*  while we're being chased by the Taliban. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2826.86s)]
*  Cool, I wanna be in good shape, bro. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2829.22s)]
*  Find people doing good. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2838.46s)]
*  As Mr. Roger said, look to the people that are helping. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2841.02s)]
*  And man, I'm good. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2844.86s)]
*  Just keep your eyes on the good. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2848.3399999999997s)]
*  That's amazing that you're able to manage your mind [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2851.46s)]
*  through all this because I know a lot of lesser men [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2853.5s)]
*  would be destroyed by one of these experiences. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2856.22s)]
*  For you to have four of them concurrent over three years. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2859.02s)]
*  That is a lot. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2863.26s)]
*  It's a lot to handle. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2864.1s)]
*  I would really like maybe in the next election cycle [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2865.38s)]
*  us to look at the past three years [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2870.38s)]
*  and maybe I'm not ready for another four years of this. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2873.02s)]
*  I don't think our organization could take it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2877.66s)]
*  I think the Rolodex of people that wanna do good [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2879.34s)]
*  with, I can only ask somebody to go into a war-torn country [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2883.74s)]
*  to try to save Americans so many times. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2888.22s)]
*  Well, unfortunately we've also demonized first responders [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2890.22s)]
*  and people that are in the military [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2894.22s)]
*  and demonize people that are police officers [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2896.14s)]
*  and border officers. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2899.1s)]
*  And this short-sighted, ridiculous approach [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2900.9s)]
*  for political purposes is just so fucking infuriating. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2905.78s)]
*  And it's so weird that more people don't understand that [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2909.7s)]
*  and more people don't see it that way. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2914.26s)]
*  The propaganda machine is a powerful thing right now [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2915.94s)]
*  and I don't know how to fight it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2919.54s)]
*  They have successfully demonized law enforcement, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2921.54s)]
*  border patrol, they take a photo of a guy riding on a horse [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2925.46s)]
*  and a horse is the best thing you can possibly have [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2928.6600000000003s)]
*  on the border. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2930.98s)]
*  If you've been to the Mexican border, it's magic. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2931.86s)]
*  I mean, do you hunt off horseback ever? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2935.5s)]
*  No. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2937.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh dude, it's the best. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2938.54s)]
*  And even like Southwest Texas, if you're going elk hunting [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2939.98s)]
*  or like you're gonna go bear hunting, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2941.98s)]
*  you're gonna go cat hunting [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2943.7s)]
*  and you think you're gonna get up through [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2944.54s)]
*  in and around Big Bend on anything but a horse, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2945.98s)]
*  you're crazy. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2948.18s)]
*  You better be on a horse. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2949.22s)]
*  And there's one photo of a guy with his reins in his hand. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2951.62s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen that. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2955.34s)]
*  They're like, this border patrol guy is whipping. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2957.06s)]
*  That's not what's happening. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2959.94s)]
*  He was using his horse to block people, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2961.38s)]
*  to prevent them from putting their lives in danger [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2963.42s)]
*  by getting into this flowing river. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2965.86s)]
*  That's what he was doing. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2968.46s)]
*  And if they make it into the interior, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2969.66s)]
*  it's a, the number of people that die from exposure, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2972.66s)]
*  once they make it across into the United States, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2976.5s)]
*  but then they try to cross, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2978.7s)]
*  like let's say they came through Big Bend. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2980.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you know how big that place is? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2984.78s)]
*  It's fucking crazy huge. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2986.7400000000002s)]
*  We're hunting in and around there [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2988.62s)]
*  and I'll come across a couple of immigrants [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2990.06s)]
*  and they are, one, we find dead bodies all the time [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2994.06s)]
*  on ranches of immigrants that just die from exposure. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=2997.82s)]
*  A friend of mine found one. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3000.3s)]
*  He has a ranch in South Texas. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3001.38s)]
*  All the time. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3002.9s)]
*  He found one really recently. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3003.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3004.56s)]
*  And these men and women on the border [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3005.4s)]
*  are trying to protect them. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3008.06s)]
*  Similarly in the propaganda vein, this pro-Hamas, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3009.3s)]
*  I just, it's, we were texting before we came on here, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3015.7400000000002s)]
*  like how fast things pivot, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3018.86s)]
*  the rational understanding of a problem [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3022.9s)]
*  and how perverted it is from truth. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3026.94s)]
*  Don't know how to fight this. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3029.9s)]
*  This is a unique problem. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3032.5s)]
*  It's very unique and it's very strange. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3034.62s)]
*  It's very strange to see massive protests on the streets [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3036.7799999999997s)]
*  that are yelling out in support of the people [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3042.18s)]
*  that did that on October 7th. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3044.98s)]
*  And there was a professor recently [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3047.06s)]
*  that said he was elated when that happened. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3049.06s)]
*  And he was just suspended, which is crazy, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3052.7s)]
*  that it's only that. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3056.82s)]
*  But the fact that there's people [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3058.0s)]
*  that are so fucking detached from reality [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3061.2s)]
*  and they have this very strange leftist Marxist philosophy [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3065.16s)]
*  that is so untenable with the reality of the world [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3072.84s)]
*  and yet they're teaching kids this. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3076.0s)]
*  And then they're talking about this openly. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3078.56s)]
*  Openly in public forums, openly in social media, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3081.68s)]
*  openly in protests, it's fucking strange. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3086.08s)]
*  It's so strange that people don't understand. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3091.72s)]
*  It's so dangerous. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3093.36s)]
*  And for young people that admire those people [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3095.44s)]
*  or that are being taught by those people [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3097.4s)]
*  and don't know any better [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3098.7999999999997s)]
*  when that person's in a position of power and influence [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3099.64s)]
*  because they're discussing these things in classrooms [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3101.68s)]
*  or discussing these things on social media, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3104.24s)]
*  I just don't understand it. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3109.2s)]
*  I'm so confused. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3111.4s)]
*  I never thought things would deteriorate this rapidly. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3112.68s)]
*  I'm disappointed, but I'm not confused [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3116.16s)]
*  when you know the powers and the money that is being spent [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3119.36s)]
*  to try to destabilize America. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3123.7599999999998s)]
*  When you look at our enemies, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3127.52s)]
*  when you're looking at China, when you're looking at Russia, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3128.6s)]
*  when you're looking at Iran [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3130.04s)]
*  and the hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3131.24s)]
*  that they're spending in misinformation and disinformation [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3133.52s)]
*  where they are perpetuating things [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3136.04s)]
*  that we 100% know to be not true, not factual, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  but they are very effectively, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3141.36s)]
*  it's unnerving Joseph Goebbels, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3149.2000000000003s)]
*  the propaganda minister for Hitler. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3151.8s)]
*  He had a playbook about how to spin truth [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3153.92s)]
*  and how to manipulate masses. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3156.2000000000003s)]
*  How could you take what is a great cool culture [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3158.84s)]
*  like the Germans were post-World War I [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3163.4s)]
*  as they're trying to find their identity [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3166.1600000000003s)]
*  and they're trying to bounce back from a horrific war [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3167.36s)]
*  and then by the mid-30s and late-30s, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3170.72s)]
*  they're positioning to throw Jews into ghettos [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3174.64s)]
*  and then ultimately gas six million of them. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3177.56s)]
*  How can that happen so fast? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3180.48s)]
*  And you very quickly realize [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3182.4399999999996s)]
*  that it was an effective propaganda misinformation campaign [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3184.68s)]
*  where they were able to dehumanize [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3188.04s)]
*  and segregate certain aspects or ideas [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3190.2s)]
*  and then attach a name to those things [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3193.52s)]
*  and a face to those things and a people to those things. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3195.6s)]
*  We saw it here during COVID, the unvaccinated [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3198.68s)]
*  and it happened fast, it happened in months [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3201.68s)]
*  and the same way that police were demonized [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3204.56s)]
*  during the defund law enforcement and BLM movement. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3207.68s)]
*  Now we know to be a complete hoax, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3210.9199999999996s)]
*  a bunch of liars that manipulated truth and data [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3212.68s)]
*  and what really happened and are there injustices? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3217.44s)]
*  Absolutely, are we a perfect nation? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3220.72s)]
*  Totally not, is law enforcement perfect? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3222.48s)]
*  No, for sure, but by and large, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3224.3999999999996s)]
*  the vast majority do wanna do good. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3227.32s)]
*  Like it says, protect and serve [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3228.84s)]
*  and that's what they raise their hand to do. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3230.04s)]
*  But they're being destroyed [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3232.6000000000004s)]
*  by this misinformation campaign [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3234.8s)]
*  and Russia and China want it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3237.28s)]
*  They want us to be fighting each other. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3241.2000000000003s)]
*  They want pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3243.36s)]
*  They want pro-Hamas protests. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3246.32s)]
*  They want from the river to the sea, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3248.48s)]
*  Palestine will be free. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3251.28s)]
*  That is a call for genocide. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3252.36s)]
*  They're calling for, so the river, the Jordan River, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3254.36s)]
*  which is on the east side of all of Israel, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3257.6s)]
*  the sea, the Mediterranean, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3259.2s)]
*  in between those two things is where Israel lies, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3261.08s)]
*  7.4 million Jews. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3263.92s)]
*  They want that to not exist. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3266.2400000000002s)]
*  They want no Jews to be there. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3268.96s)]
*  So every time that you hear from the river to the sea, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3270.68s)]
*  it is a call for genocide or an expulsion [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3273.32s)]
*  of all Jews out of Israel. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3276.0s)]
*  And that is the call of Hamas. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3277.8s)]
*  And guess who's paying for that thing [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3281.2400000000002s)]
*  to be seen on Cornell and in Harvard [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3283.08s)]
*  and in every, that's right, the Russia and China. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3286.3999999999996s)]
*  They're being manipulated by a bunch of our enemies [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3289.4799999999996s)]
*  as they're trying to destabilize us in a region [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3292.4399999999996s)]
*  and here in the United States. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3294.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's a vulnerability that we have [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3295.8799999999997s)]
*  because of our freedom. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3298.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3299.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but man, I love freedom. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3302.4399999999996s)]

*  That's why I moved here. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3308.08s)]
*  I love, the way that freedom would work [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3309.3199999999997s)]
*  was that there was an educated, empowered citizen [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3314.4s)]
*  that was individually responsible [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3318.04s)]
*  for themselves and their family. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3319.48s)]
*  And they were in a position of authority [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3321.4s)]
*  over the government. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3324.44s)]

*  It was because of the power of the people. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3329.36s)]
*  And over the past 50, 60 years, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3331.32s)]
*  our people have become fat, gelatinous, complacent, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3333.84s)]
*  uneducated, subscribed to propaganda, radicals, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3338.28s)]
*  aligned with agendas that are not pro-America. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3343.12s)]
*  And in the course of this time, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3346.44s)]
*  it makes that document have no teeth. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3348.6s)]
*  There's nothing behind it [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3353.24s)]
*  because the government used to be scared of the people [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3354.24s)]
*  because the people, when we decided to throw [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3356.56s)]
*  some tea in a harbor and the shot hurt around the world, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3359.72s)]
*  we went after the people that were attacking us [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3362.92s)]
*  and that were controlling us. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3366.96s)]
*  And we killed them and we pushed them off this land. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3372.04s)]
*  And then we wrote these founding documents that said, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3374.48s)]
*  the individual is going to maintain the power. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3377.92s)]
*  The people are going to have the power. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3380.12s)]
*  But the only way that works is if the people have power. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3382.16s)]
*  And we've let that go, bit by bit, diet by diet, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3385.8799999999997s)]
*  day by day, lack of exercising of our God-given rights. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3390.3199999999997s)]
*  We are now just soft. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3397.96s)]
*  It's one of the reasons when I was kicking around with you, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3399.96s)]
*  like, hey, am I going to, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3402.0s)]
*  do we really want to talk about this? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3403.52s)]
*  This is tough. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3404.8s)]
*  Like I have 25 pages of notes here [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3405.64s)]
*  about the Middle East conflict. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3408.28s)]
*  But ultimately I'm scared that that can happen here [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3410.36s)]
*  because we are so vulnerable right now as people. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3413.52s)]
*  And it's the reason that Sheepdog Response exists. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3417.44s)]
*  My company is to train the American individual [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3419.28s)]
*  to take their own security, to preserve and protect human [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3422.92s)]
*  life and be able to provide for the family. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3425.2s)]
*  That's the mission statement. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3427.0s)]
*  But right now I don't know what percentage Americans [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3428.84s)]
*  are capable of doing that. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3430.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a very small number. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3433.04s)]
*  Very small. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3434.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, frighteningly small. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3435.0800000000004s)]
*  And that is being, it's being discussed as if somehow [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3436.76s)]
*  or another that small number is a strength that we are [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  in somehow or another a more kind and a more equitable [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3446.32s)]
*  nation because people are so soft, because people are so, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3451.36s)]
*  it's just, it's, I don't know how you have those two, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3456.7999999999997s)]
*  how do you have such freedom that allows people [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3463.04s)]
*  to have these protests, that allows people to have [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3466.84s)]
*  these differing perspectives and to speak about it openly [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3469.36s)]
*  and publicly, but yet still maintain the strength [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3472.04s)]
*  of the union when you have all of these external factors, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3477.0s)]
*  all of these different countries and different [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3481.12s)]
*  organizations that are working to try to use propaganda [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3483.24s)]
*  and use money to destroy us. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3488.2799999999997s)]
*  Because that's really what's happening. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3490.96s)]
*  And that's like, that used to be like, if you said [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3492.16s)]
*  there's people out there that are trying to destroy America, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3495.24s)]
*  oh, you're some crazy right wing fucking alt right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3496.8399999999997s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3500.3999999999996s)]
*  How much information do you have to see? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3501.22s)]
*  How much truth do you have to see that you cannot deny? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3502.96s)]
*  That's a farfetched face. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3506.7999999999997s)]
*  Russian interference into the election. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3507.64s)]
*  Bold face lie. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3510.0s)]
*  They weren't interfering. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3511.52s)]
*  They're perpetuating that they were interfering, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3512.56s)]
*  but they weren't interfering. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3515.7599999999998s)]
*  Really, that Trump was being influenced by. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3517.12s)]
*  But that he was a Russian Asian. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3519.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3520.24s)]
*  Well guess who was pushing that story? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3521.44s)]
*  The Russians and China, because it destabilized [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3523.48s)]
*  our election process. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3526.04s)]
*  So your question is, how do you reconcile having [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3528.04s)]
*  such freedoms where somebody can go and say something [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3532.52s)]
*  so detestable, like praising a group of people [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3534.84s)]
*  that went and raped and murdered 1,400 people [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3538.44s)]
*  that currently have 240 hostages? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3541.64s)]
*  Like that's what Hamas has. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3544.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, there's 30 to 40,000 Hamas operatives [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3545.3599999999997s)]
*  within Gaza. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3547.52s)]
*  They have a ton of hostages. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3548.7599999999998s)]
*  Like how can somebody have so much freedom to say that? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3549.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's if the people are prepared to be able to protect [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3554.74s)]
*  and preserve and provide. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3559.3199999999997s)]
*  Then if you're in a position of authority, sovereignty, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3561.24s)]
*  it's this, it's the next step past freedom. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3563.8799999999997s)]
*  Sovereignty is what I want for me. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3566.7599999999998s)]
*  It's what I want for every American. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3568.12s)]
*  It's that they are in control of themselves. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3569.92s)]
*  An external force comes and says, Tim, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3572.88s)]
*  I want you to take this experimental thing [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3575.08s)]
*  and give it to your child and inject it into them, please. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3577.2000000000003s)]
*  I say, no, no, I don't need it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3579.76s)]
*  Whatever it is you're about to withhold from me [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3582.32s)]
*  because I don't do this thing. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3584.92s)]
*  I don't need because I can do it myself. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3586.4s)]
*  That's sovereignty, right? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3588.42s)]
*  I don't need you to come and try and protect my family [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3589.76s)]
*  because I can protect my family. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3592.64s)]
*  You know, come and try and mess with them [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3594.7200000000003s)]
*  because like my family is unattainable to anybody else. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3596.4s)]
*  They're completely protected. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3599.16s)]
*  Education, the reason I started these schools [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3601.8399999999997s)]
*  is because I do not want anyone else to have influence [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3604.12s)]
*  over the way that my children are gonna learn [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3606.3999999999996s)]
*  how to be critical thinkers. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3608.24s)]

*  I want them to be powerful. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3610.7799999999997s)]
*  I want them to be cognitive in every single debatable subject [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3611.8799999999997s)]
*  to have the Socratic mind where they can sit [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3615.04s)]

*  whether it was post 9-11 or during COVID [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3630.2000000000003s)]

*  they're gonna be looking for more laws [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3641.1800000000003s)]
*  to try and control more of the second amendment [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3642.52s)]
*  and limit the freedoms that we have. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3644.44s)]

*  which also is something that no one's trying to fix. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3692.4399999999996s)]
*  And then the actual people that strap themselves up [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3695.56s)]
*  and go into places where people are unarmed [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3699.72s)]
*  and just slaughter people. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3701.9199999999996s)]
*  Almost all of them are on something. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3703.64s)]
*  They're almost all of them, they're on SSRIs, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3707.9199999999996s)]
*  almost all of them are on some sort [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3710.72s)]
*  of anti-anxiety medication, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3712.4399999999996s)]
*  almost all of them are on something. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3713.76s)]
*  And that we don't address that, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3716.0s)]
*  it's not even talked about, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3717.5200000000004s)]
*  that it's like fucking Voldemort. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3718.84s)]
*  How do you say it? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3721.2000000000003s)]
*  Voldemort? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3722.0400000000004s)]
*  Not talked about Voldemort, yeah. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3722.86s)]
*  You're not supposed to say the name. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3723.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's like, it's very strange [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3724.76s)]
*  that this is never discussed on television. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3726.9s)]
*  You said you can't research it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3728.5200000000004s)]
*  When you say it's buried, that data, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3730.36s)]
*  if you were like, how many active shooters [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3732.4s)]
*  were on a antidepressant, anything, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3734.6400000000003s)]
*  that all of that data is buried with, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3738.94s)]
*  well, then it pops up, well, in Chicago, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3741.1200000000003s)]
*  in Southern California, it's buried in truth. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3743.8799999999997s)]
*  So trying to find the real data [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3747.98s)]
*  of these active shooters in schools, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3749.48s)]
*  like this guy in Maine, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3751.24s)]
*  known mental health problems. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3755.2799999999997s)]
*  And he actually tried to buy a suppressor [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3757.64s)]
*  and failed trying to buy the suppressor [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3760.0s)]
*  because he's self-elected. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3762.08s)]
*  He told them that he had just recently [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3763.4399999999996s)]
*  got out of a mental institution. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3765.14s)]
*  So kudos to them. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3767.48s)]
*  I'm part of this group called Double Check [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3769.4399999999996s)]
*  that's trying to figure out ways [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3772.56s)]
*  to identify outliers like this, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3774.16s)]
*  where people have information. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3776.24s)]
*  They wrote their manifesto of like, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3777.82s)]
*  hey, I'm gonna go murder a bunch of people. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3779.12s)]
*  I'm gonna go to this black church and kill everybody. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3781.56s)]
*  A lot of times that information is available. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3783.96s)]
*  As I love the Second Amendment, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3788.4s)]
*  every single person should be able to have [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3790.02s)]
*  a tank and a machine gun, in my opinion. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3791.38s)]
*  But when somebody is dealing with mental health problems, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3794.12s)]
*  they are on a bunch of drugs, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3797.2s)]
*  they are actively trying to hurt people. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3798.8s)]
*  Maybe there's a restraining order, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3801.08s)]
*  there are multi-time felons. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3803.32s)]
*  Should that guy be able to go in and buy? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3804.16s)]
*  Well, clearly that guy right there [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3806.32s)]
*  was stopped from getting a tool [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3808.96s)]
*  to maybe even hurt more people by just, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3811.08s)]
*  and as a small business owner, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3814.04s)]
*  it is my choice who I'm gonna sell to [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3815.62s)]
*  and who I'm gonna choose to sell a product to. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3817.76s)]
*  And if that product is a thing, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3821.08s)]
*  like ultimate the individual responsibility [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3822.88s)]
*  as an entrepreneur and a small business owner is like, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3825.64s)]
*  it is my choice who I who sell this to. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3828.28s)]
*  And that guy comes in and he says that he's on drugs [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3830.72s)]
*  and he just got out of a mental health hospital, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3833.72s)]
*  like, man, you could go buy your suppressor somewhere else. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3835.16s)]
*  Like that guy in Maine just went through it. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3839.24s)]
*  So DoubleCheck is trying to infuse themselves [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3841.24s)]
*  in a really helpful way to protect people like me [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3845.2s)]
*  that own a gun store, where if that guy walks into my door, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3848.6s)]
*  I can have real data to point to him. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3851.96s)]
*  So like, boop, I do a little search, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3854.3599999999997s)]
*  it pops up as like, hey man, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3856.24s)]
*  you just wrote that you wanna go shoot up a school. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3858.84s)]
*  Can we talk about that before I sell you a gun? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3864.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3867.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3868.6400000000003s)]
*  You said that you hate black people [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3869.46s)]
*  and that you think that they all should die [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3872.6800000000003s)]
*  or like that guy in Harvard Square yesterday [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3874.6800000000003s)]
*  that was walking around saying that every Jew [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3876.7200000000003s)]
*  should have their neck slit. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3878.6400000000003s)]
*  There should be no Jew businesses. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3880.08s)]
*  This is like in Harvard Square. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3881.28s)]
*  Like if that guy walked into my gun store, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3883.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna go to DoubleCheck and be like, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3885.86s)]
*  man, so you said some pretty outrageous things yesterday. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3887.88s)]
*  I think you need help. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3891.8s)]
*  Let's go for a run and let's go get you some real help. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3894.48s)]
*  And what help do they even get? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3899.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, and also like how much help do they get [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3901.76s)]
*  in getting off of that shit? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3904.56s)]
*  And is there a way to get off of that shit? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3906.04s)]
*  I mean, if you are legitimately mentally ill [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3908.44s)]
*  and you're on a host of psychiatric medications, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3910.56s)]
*  like what motivation do they have [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3913.4s)]
*  to even take you off of that shit? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3918.44s)]
*  I'm not a doctor. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3920.04s)]
*  Oh, they don't have a motivation [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3920.88s)]
*  because they don't make money when you're not taking drugs. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3921.88s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3925.4s)]
*  But you also know the answer to this. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3926.92s)]
*  So in all of the things I've experienced [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3928.64s)]
*  in the past three years, like post-traumatic stress, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3933.7200000000003s)]
*  any single one of those single days [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3937.62s)]
*  over the course of months upon months [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3940.06s)]
*  would be enough for me to be like, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3942.2s)]
*  dude, I'm out of here, right? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3943.52s)]
*  Instead, definitely not on any drugs. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3946.12s)]
*  Exercise every single day, cold plunge, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3950.12s)]
*  hang out with my friends, do grappling, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  contribute in a meaningful way back to society. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3955.2s)]
*  I have an amazing relationship with my beautiful wife. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3958.2s)]
*  I have incredible children that I'm so proud of. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3960.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm active. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3962.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm now like playing hockey with my son [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3963.2s)]
*  as a 45 year old dude that just went to a yard sale [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3964.68s)]
*  to buy all the hockey stuff so I can get out there [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3967.68s)]
*  and try to dunk on my eight year old [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3969.64s)]
*  who skates around me making me look like an idiot. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3970.92s)]
*  I also got all my lacrosse stuff. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3974.52s)]
*  I got tap shoes so I can start doing tap dancing [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3976.4s)]
*  with my four year old. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3978.86s)]
*  These are the things that healthy people do. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3980.44s)]
*  Sitting on the couch, eating a bunch of shit, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3983.04s)]
*  not going outside, not having any relationships, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3984.88s)]
*  not having any community, not finding ways [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3986.88s)]
*  to give back to their community. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3988.76s)]
*  Of course you're broken. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3989.6800000000003s)]
*  So how do you get off the drugs? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3991.32s)]
*  You start doing little tiny little bits, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3992.34s)]
*  1% improvement every single day. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3994.16s)]
*  And ultimately, the sun is brighter, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3996.28s)]
*  your wife is more beautiful, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=3999.56s)]
*  your kids are just a little bit more rad, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4001.08s)]
*  and you're able to go do more good for more people. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4003.56s)]
*  But people don't have this guidance [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4006.72s)]
*  and that's what's crazy. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4008.92s)]

*  because if you have chickens, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4328.2s)]
*  there's a good chance you're gonna have mice. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4330.24s)]
*  And if you have mice, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4331.48s)]
*  then you're gonna have a really happy cat. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4332.44s)]
*  And my Belgian Malawah, and she comes in [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4334.4s)]
*  and she just sits there like she's the king of the roost. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4338.44s)]
*  And then one of the chickens comes over [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4342.32s)]
*  and reminds her that she's nothing, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4343.16s)]
*  that the chickens are actually in charge of the yard. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4344.0s)]
*  But the amount of eggs that they come, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4346.92s)]
*  but when you get that first time that you crack an egg [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4348.24s)]
*  from one of your chickens [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4351.799999999999s)]
*  and you're like, that looks different. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4353.48s)]
*  And then you eat it and you're like, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4355.639999999999s)]
*  dude, that tastes different. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4356.86s)]
*  A lot different. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4358.16s)]
*  Like way different. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4359.0s)]
*  Way different. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4360.24s)]
*  It's like that dark, deep orange. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4361.08s)]
*  Like not yellow, not pale, like orange. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4364.4s)]
*  And it's like, you can taste the nutrient, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4367.639999999999s)]
*  micronutrient riches of it. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4369.96s)]
*  And then you're like, well, if that is that different, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4372.0s)]
*  how much different is all of the other things that I eat? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4375.4s)]
*  And you start going down this wild journey, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4379.52s)]
*  this rabbit trail of freedom. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4381.72s)]
*  And how much different am I? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4384.4800000000005s)]
*  When you look at the difference between grain fed, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4387.0s)]
*  fatty beef and an elk steak, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4389.68s)]
*  you're like, okay, look at the difference in the meat. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4392.5s)]
*  Look at the difference in the quality of the meat, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4395.6s)]
*  the dark, rich, nutrient dense protein rich meat. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4397.8s)]
*  Like what's the difference? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4402.8s)]
*  Well, they're not eating any bullshit. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4404.02s)]
*  They're eating literally what they've eaten [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4406.12s)]
*  for hundreds of thousands of years. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4408.04s)]
*  And they have to work every day to find more of it. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4410.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4413.400000000001s)]
*  And the unhealthy bits, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4414.24s)]
*  and this is a cruel thing about nature, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4415.96s)]
*  is the unhealthy animal dies. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4417.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4420.0s)]
*  And the existing animals are the ones [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4420.84s)]
*  that we ultimately get to go and find. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4423.4800000000005s)]
*  And we are very careful about which ones we're killing [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4425.28s)]
*  and what season we're killing them in [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4428.92s)]
*  to make sure that we're encouraging the same healthy herd. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4430.96s)]
*  We get this most delicious, surviving, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4435.88s)]
*  fantastic nutrient dense meat you can find on the planet. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4439.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4442.759999999999s)]
*  And we have this provider, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4443.599999999999s)]
*  we launched a learn to hunt school. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4448.12s)]
*  It's, we teach you how to land navigate. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4452.5199999999995s)]

*  We teach you all basic, good laws around hunting, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4457.44s)]
*  how to put in out of state for a lottery for- [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4463.92s)]
*  Is this a part of your school system? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4467.599999999999s)]
*  We teach it at our school, but at Sheepdog Response. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4469.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4472.12s)]
*  It's called the provider course at Sheepdog Response. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4473.599999999999s)]
*  We also teach it to the kids. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4476.16s)]
*  So like the mentorship program at Apogee, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4478.0s)]
*  those guys get to come to provider courses. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4482.8s)]
*  They learn how to skin an animal. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4485.36s)]
*  They learn how to follow a blood trail. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4486.76s)]
*  They learn how to field dress an animal. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4488.44s)]
*  They learn the final culminating exercise. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4490.12s)]
*  You'll love this. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4492.4800000000005s)]
*  So after two days of just like inundated information, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4493.32s)]
*  like here's the healthy and natural way to kill an animal. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4496.68s)]
*  This is shot placement. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4503.64s)]
*  This is, you have to know how to shoot first. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4504.64s)]
*  So we teach fundamentals of marksmanship, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4506.52s)]
*  non-standard shooting positions. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4508.52s)]
*  Like how many times you get to lay down in the prone [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4510.32s)]
*  off bipods and shoot something. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4512.0s)]
*  Not often in hunting, like can I shoot off poles? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4513.719999999999s)]
*  Can I shoot off a tree kneeling, standing off hand? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4515.96s)]
*  If I get a designated zone in Arizona or New Mexico, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4520.32s)]
*  can I navigate from where I can park [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4524.96s)]
*  to where I have to go hunt [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4526.799999999999s)]
*  without illegally trespassing on anybody's property? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4527.92s)]
*  Like the barrier between I wanna hunt and I can hunt [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4531.88s)]
*  is hard for some people. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4536.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4538.36s)]
*  Like I'm the person here talking about like [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4539.2s)]
*  how amazing it is to hunt. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4540.639999999999s)]
*  And it is the most amazing thing [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4542.32s)]
*  that I want everybody to do. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4544.32s)]
*  That barrier of entry seems hard for some people. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4546.16s)]
*  It's very steep. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4548.5199999999995s)]
*  But it shouldn't be. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4550.28s)]
*  And that's the idea. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4551.84s)]
*  Like I want this for everybody. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4552.72s)]
*  In the final day, we give you your lot. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4554.92s)]
*  We give you your animal. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  You have to navigate to that place. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4558.639999999999s)]
*  You then have to PID, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4560.72s)]
*  like positively identify the animal [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4562.48s)]
*  that you're supposed to shoot. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4564.08s)]
*  And then you go to take a shot off it. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4565.24s)]
*  Once you take your shot off of it, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4568.400000000001s)]
*  we photograph how you're gonna take that shot. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4570.240000000001s)]
*  Standing, kneeling, sticks. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4573.320000000001s)]
*  We measure the distance. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4575.64s)]
*  We lay as you're at 210 meters. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4577.120000000001s)]
*  And then we go duplicate that [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4579.6s)]
*  on an actual shooting range on the same target. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4581.280000000001s)]
*  And it's so fun to see like the full buck fever [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4584.6s)]
*  of somebody freaking out [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4590.240000000001s)]
*  when they don't even have a round in the chamber. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4591.92s)]
*  They're just looking at a 3D target [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4593.52s)]
*  out at Revelry Peak Ranch and burn it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4596.68s)]
*  It is such a joy to introduce, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4599.0s)]
*  every class we have 40 people [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4603.0s)]
*  and every class is sold out. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4604.88s)]
*  And the end result at the end of three days [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4607.68s)]
*  are like these people that are just like, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4610.64s)]
*  they feel like they're gonna explode [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4613.4400000000005s)]
*  with this excitement about what it means. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4615.04s)]
*  Cause they now know that they can go and hunt. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4617.12s)]
*  Do you have a mind management program [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4619.16s)]
*  to deal with the moment of actually shooting? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4622.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4625.12s)]
*  Are you familiar with Joel Turner's work? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4626.56s)]
*  The Shot IQ system. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4628.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4629.8s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah, for sure. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4630.64s)]
*  Changed everything for me and so many other people, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4631.6s)]
*  including like world-class archers [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4634.52s)]
*  and people that have been hunting for decades [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4636.72s)]
*  that have dealt with target panic [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4638.72s)]
*  and don't understand what's actually going on [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4640.24s)]
*  between open loop and closed loop systems [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4641.6s)]
*  and that you can actually manage that with discipline [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4644.28s)]
*  and actually having a shot routine [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4647.36s)]
*  that you must go through every time you execute a shot. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4650.72s)]
*  Changes everything. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4653.72s)]

*  You have an untrained mind. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4823.280000000001s)]
*  You haven't got the reps in. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4825.240000000001s)]

*  It's, as worried as I am about the future, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4829.6s)]
*  Apogee and at Sheepdog Response and at Save Our Allies [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4836.200000000001s)]
*  and the First Responders Action Group. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4840.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, I'm in all of these different groups [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4843.400000000001s)]
*  where I see these young men and women [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4845.240000000001s)]
*  that are on this train. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4847.4800000000005s)]
*  And I know I'm not in a cross section [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4848.88s)]
*  of the United States right now [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4853.6s)]
*  that is really struggling with all of the problems of, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4855.0s)]
*  you know, mental health and obesity and diet. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4857.400000000001s)]
*  But in this little group that I'm around often, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4859.84s)]
*  I'm just so encouraged by the work and the discipline [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4862.68s)]
*  and the subscription to the process. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4867.12s)]
*  Like last night in my jujitsu school, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4868.6s)]
*  I had 60 kids on our mat at one time. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4870.400000000001s)]
*  And I said, hey, parents, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4873.4800000000005s)]
*  everybody come into the classroom really fast. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4874.76s)]
*  We're gonna have a Q&A session about competition [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4876.32s)]
*  and what this next season looks like. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4879.56s)]
*  Every parent like stood up, walked in there. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4880.56s)]
*  They had questions. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4883.04s)]
*  Like they didn't even know, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4884.0s)]
*  but like they didn't know that we're gonna be doing a Q&A. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4884.84s)]
*  They had pre-prepared questions [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4887.320000000001s)]
*  that they were looking for an opportunity to ask the staff [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4888.72s)]
*  about like, okay, how is coaching gonna be [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4891.4800000000005s)]
*  at the next tournament? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4892.96s)]
*  And I was just like, I love you people, you know? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4894.12s)]
*  Like the parents to the Apogee families, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4896.2s)]
*  cause we take a totally different approach. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4898.280000000001s)]
*  We're a whole family approach to education. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4900.52s)]
*  Like if you subscribe to this idea [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4903.12s)]
*  that you can take your kid and you can drop them off [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4905.320000000001s)]
*  at a place and you're gonna get this amazing thing back [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4907.8s)]
*  that you don't have any control [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4910.76s)]
*  about what they're being taught. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4911.84s)]
*  You are just an idiot and you're a crazy person. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4912.76s)]
*  Like you send your people to Caesar, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4915.68s)]
*  you send your people to Rome [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4919.68s)]
*  and you don't think you're gonna Roman back? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4920.68s)]
*  Like that's what's gonna happen. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4922.84s)]
*  Right, that's a good way to put it. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4923.92s)]
*  Our approach is there's a whole family inclusion here. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4926.16s)]
*  It is not just our responsibility to train [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4930.4400000000005s)]
*  and to educate your children. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4934.08s)]
*  It is our responsibility. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4935.56s)]
*  So you are going to work out, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4938.080000000001s)]
*  you're gonna keep a journal of your diet. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4940.56s)]
*  Here is your prescribed reading list. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4942.8s)]
*  Here are the books that your kids are gonna be reading [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4944.72s)]
*  that you're also going to be reading with them. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4946.6s)]
*  Like if your kid is reading it, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4948.6s)]
*  then you better be reading it too. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4949.72s)]
*  You'd be very appalled at some of the books [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4951.6s)]
*  that are assigned to children in public school to read. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4954.04s)]
*  And I think if a parent actually picked this book up [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4956.64s)]
*  and it's like, and then Johnny took his penis [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4958.72s)]
*  and he brought it and it was erect for the first time [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4960.88s)]
*  next to his friend. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4963.280000000001s)]
*  Like what, this is for a fourth grader? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4964.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4966.72s)]
*  So this whole family approach, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4968.04s)]
*  that this truly Socratic, this is not new. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4969.84s)]
*  This has been around for a long time. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4973.44s)]
*  And I'm so encouraged to see the activation, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4975.36s)]
*  the discipline, the process and the hard work [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4979.64s)]
*  from the youngest kindergartner all the way up [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4981.76s)]
*  to like the 60 year old parent that's like doing the work. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4984.64s)]
*  It's so bizarre to me that a rejection of teaching [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4987.84s)]
*  like overt sexuality to young kids [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4993.16s)]
*  is somehow or another dismissed as anti-gay or anti-LBGTQ. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=4996.52s)]
*  It's so strange, cause you could never imagine [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5003.56s)]
*  heterosexual sex being discussed [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5008.08s)]
*  to five year olds and six year olds. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5010.84s)]
*  Like this is how a man chooses to have [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5013.400000000001s)]
*  sexual relationships with women. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5017.84s)]
*  And this is how a woman chooses [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5020.4800000000005s)]
*  to have sexual relationships with men. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5021.64s)]
*  No, that's never discussed. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5023.0s)]
*  That's wildly inappropriate. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5024.12s)]
*  Wildly inappropriate, but somehow or another it's okay [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5025.56s)]
*  if you're discussing gay sex. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5028.64s)]
*  Like it's very strange. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5031.04s)]
*  It's not strange, it's wrong. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5034.200000000001s)]
*  It's dangerous, it's a grooming behavior. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5035.92s)]
*  If you're trying to broach any sexual topic [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5039.160000000001s)]
*  with a child that is not of age to have sex, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5043.160000000001s)]
*  that is grooming. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5046.360000000001s)]
*  That is the definition of grooming. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5047.200000000001s)]
*  Right, and grooming itself, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5048.64s)]
*  that term is dismissed as anti-LBGTQ and whatever. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5050.2s)]
*  Wild. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5055.92s)]
*  I love gay people. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5056.76s)]
*  I do not, this is the idea about being American. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5058.36s)]
*  As do I. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5060.36s)]
*  Like don't care bro, do anything that you want. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5061.2s)]
*  You talked to my eight year old about anything sexual, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5063.72s)]
*  hetero, homo, anything, it's wildly inappropriate. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5067.5199999999995s)]
*  He's eight. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5070.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5071.76s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5072.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's one reason. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5074.04s)]
*  And it is not for the benefit of the eight year old. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5075.5199999999995s)]
*  It's indoctrination. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5077.76s)]
*  That's right. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5078.599999999999s)]
*  And to say that somehow or another is homophobic, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5079.56s)]
*  which is so insane. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5082.6s)]
*  Like how did that become reality [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5084.6s)]
*  that we're dealing with this? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5087.64s)]
*  Because this is not the case a decade ago, two decades ago. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5088.6s)]
*  This is very recent in terms of modern society [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5091.88s)]
*  in this country. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5096.080000000001s)]
*  It's fucking crazy, it's crazy. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5099.56s)]
*  And it also, to me, it's so confusing [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5102.240000000001s)]
*  that other people don't recognize that. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5107.92s)]
*  And that people are so, they're so scared [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5110.08s)]
*  of being labeled as homophobic or being labeled [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5114.24s)]
*  as transphobic or anti-LBGTQ that they allow these things [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5116.88s)]
*  to take place under the guise of we're being more inclusive. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5121.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5125.12s)]
*  It does hurt to be called a bigot to like, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5128.48s)]
*  you're racist or you're anti-LGBTQ. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5132.639999999999s)]
*  I don't want like those things said about me. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5136.24s)]
*  And I know that they're completely wrong, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5138.12s)]
*  but they're gonna lob that unfounded accusation at me [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5142.24s)]
*  because I'm gonna stand on a principle [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5144.92s)]
*  of protecting my children. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5146.48s)]
*  And would I rather take, there's a great photo [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5148.2s)]
*  of a dad standing over his children and on his back, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5150.84s)]
*  he has like all of these darts. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5155.36s)]
*  And the cartoon was, man, who, the darts were named. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5157.04s)]
*  It was Disney propaganda, it was LGBTQ indoctrination. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5161.6s)]
*  It's racial discrimination, it was 69 Project. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5166.72s)]
*  It was like every single thing that they're attacked with, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5168.6s)]
*  just relentlessly every single day. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5170.68s)]
*  And the dad's just sitting there taking it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5173.68s)]
*  And that is our job is to take it. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5175.36s)]
*  So you can call me any names that you want, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5177.36s)]
*  but first and foremost, my position is to protect my children [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5180.0s)]
*  and to raise somebody that will be a contributing member [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5183.08s)]
*  of society. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5185.68s)]
*  My partner, Matt Boudreaux at Apogee, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5186.84s)]
*  he was in public education. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5189.88s)]
*  Like that was his origin, that was his start. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5192.32s)]
*  The genesis of his journey where we collided [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5194.76s)]
*  was he had went and started the two largest [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5197.68s)]
*  Socratic schools in the United States. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5199.8s)]
*  Like hundreds and hundreds of students going to learn [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5201.360000000001s)]
*  just the Socratic approach. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5204.6s)]
*  And he thought that there was more that needed to be done [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5207.24s)]
*  on the full family approach, where the dad and the mom [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5210.280000000001s)]
*  and the brothers and the sisters, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5214.320000000001s)]
*  everybody's on the same journey to become [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5215.360000000001s)]
*  the best versions of themselves. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5217.64s)]
*  So Matt and I collide with both of us working [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5220.04s)]
*  at the exact same thing, with the same ideas, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5222.320000000001s)]
*  with the same approaches, with the same love for America. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5224.48s)]
*  And the end result is dads and moms becoming those things [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5228.919999999999s)]
*  where they will be the stop gap between all of this hate [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5234.5199999999995s)]
*  and all of these dangerous ideas. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5239.919999999999s)]
*  And if you're not doing that, like if parenting's not hard, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5242.12s)]
*  maybe you're not a good parent, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5247.16s)]
*  because parenting is hard. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5249.639999999999s)]
*  It's complicated. It is. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5251.44s)]
*  And like it should, you know, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5252.799999999999s)]
*  my wife and I last night sat there for an hour [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5253.88s)]
*  and broke down like next school year books that we're reading, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5256.56s)]
*  you know, like for an hour on, on a, what was it? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5261.8s)]
*  A Tuesday night. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5264.96s)]
*  We're just sitting there like hammering through, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5265.8s)]
*  like were there a lot of other things [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5268.04s)]
*  I'd rather be doing for an hour with my wife? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5269.4800000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5271.56s)]
*  But highs and lows on Sunday, my son had lacrosse practice. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5272.72s)]
*  It was cold. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5277.68s)]
*  It was rainy and his whole entire team, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5278.52s)]
*  like third graders out there shivering and being, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5281.16s)]
*  and showing grit. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5286.24s)]
*  And I was like, my heart was exploding with pride. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5287.28s)]
*  And I never said, you had to stay out there. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5290.24s)]
*  I was like, you know, hey, practice is stay. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5292.28s)]
*  We get there. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5294.84s)]
*  The coach was in shorts and he was just, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5295.68s)]
*  his fingers were white. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5297.5599999999995s)]
*  His cheeks were like bright red from the cold, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5299.04s)]
*  but he stood there and he took it and he showed grit. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5302.0s)]
*  And then all of these third graders followed in suit. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5304.2s)]
*  And I was just like heart exploding with pride [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5306.96s)]
*  as my son demonstrated like this, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5309.88s)]
*  this will follow through with this thing [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5312.04s)]
*  that I've committed to do. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5315.56s)]
*  And it hurt me to watch my son be cold. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5317.12s)]
*  And it hurt me. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5320.4800000000005s)]
*  And this is why parenting is hard. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5321.4800000000005s)]
*  And if it doesn't, and if I didn't care, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5322.96s)]
*  I don't think there's any greater insult than indifference. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5326.0s)]
*  And to be indifferent to your kid is just like, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5329.16s)]
*  the worst thing you could be as a human. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5333.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's so selfish. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5335.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a crazy way of thinking. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5338.0s)]
*  But so many people are just so occupied with their own life [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5340.2s)]
*  and they're so busy that they just don't have the time [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5343.08s)]
*  to have conversations with their kid [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5346.5599999999995s)]
*  or even think about it. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5347.8s)]
*  Like, ah, they're going to school. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5348.8s)]
*  That's school's job. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5350.36s)]
*  Anyone busier than you or me? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5351.36s)]
*  Elon. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5355.44s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5356.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5357.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5359.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe not. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5361.0s)]
*  I don't know, we're pretty busy. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  We're pretty busy. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5365.36s)]
*  I think it's a part of life. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5367.04s)]
*  It's also very rewarding. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5370.28s)]
*  I mean, to see your kids getting after it, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5372.08s)]
*  it's very rewarding. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5374.12s)]
*  My youngest has become a real fitness freak. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5375.719999999999s)]
*  She's a nut. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5378.16s)]
*  She's got a Fitbit now. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5379.0s)]
*  She's 13 and she's a savage. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5379.96s)]
*  She likes to tell me, like, did 28,000 steps today. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5381.96s)]
*  She gets up at six o'clock in the morning [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5384.679999999999s)]
*  and hits the gym before she goes to school. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5386.24s)]
*  And then she had a volleyball game. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5388.4s)]
*  Yeah, 13. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5391.799999999999s)]
*  She had a volleyball game. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5392.719999999999s)]
*  She got up at six o'clock in the morning, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5393.88s)]
*  ran for two miles, then went to the volleyball game, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5395.56s)]
*  did the volleyball game. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5399.160000000001s)]
*  They're playing this tournament. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5400.8s)]
*  They play these three games, comes back home, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5402.120000000001s)]
*  hits the gym again. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5404.4800000000005s)]
*  So she's getting three workouts in a day. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5405.72s)]
*  She's showing me her results and all those things. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5408.72s)]
*  And then we're obviously giving her positive feedback [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5410.56s)]
*  because of it, but now she's like super fired up. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5413.6s)]
*  And that you see the difference in her body, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5416.68s)]
*  like her abs are showing and her body feels like, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5418.96s)]
*  she's like a fucking little panther. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5422.280000000001s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5424.64s)]
*  So rewarding. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5426.72s)]
*  Not to be, and I don't mean to disparage other families [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5427.92s)]
*  that haven't made it there yet or haven't subscribed [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5430.8s)]
*  to these ideas of discipline and regimen. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5433.64s)]
*  But our kids compared to my son, my daughters, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5438.56s)]
*  they're just so much better than everybody else. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5442.68s)]
*  I don't mean to sound terrible, but like, they do the work. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5446.8s)]
*  I also think it's a lead by example thing. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5451.200000000001s)]
*  Children, you can teach them things, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5453.68s)]
*  but they learn a lot from just watching you. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5455.320000000001s)]
*  They learn a lot when they learn what the standards are. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5458.160000000001s)]
*  Like when you see someone who's happy and fulfilled [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5462.68s)]
*  and also successful and you're like, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5465.76s)]
*  what is that person doing? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5466.96s)]
*  Like, well, that person's my mom. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5468.280000000001s)]
*  What is my mom doing? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5469.64s)]
*  Oh, my mom's a fucking animal. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5470.56s)]
*  Like, look at her. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5472.200000000001s)]
*  Jesus, I wanna be like her. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5473.04s)]
*  Like, and that's how kids learn. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5474.200000000001s)]
*  They learn from that. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5475.56s)]
*  They learn from seeing things too. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5476.52s)]
*  They don't just learn from the things you tell them. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5478.360000000001s)]
*  They learn from watching you, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5480.280000000001s)]
*  from watching you live your own life. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5482.0s)]
*  And if you're a slob and you come home [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5483.64s)]
*  and just fucking eating sub sandwiches [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5485.4s)]
*  and just drinking whiskey all night [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5487.16s)]
*  and just falling asleep watching sports, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5488.56s)]
*  like you kids are like, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5490.96s)]
*  look at this fucking aimless existence. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5492.04s)]
*  Like, this is stupid. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5494.24s)]
*  Like, God, life is meaningless. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5495.16s)]
*  Yeah, give them purpose. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5497.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5497.96s)]
*  We're such a society void of purpose. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5498.8s)]
*  Mike Glover wrote a great book, Prepared, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5504.92s)]
*  and that in that one of the big takeaways was, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5507.6s)]
*  like, it doesn't have to be your purpose, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5512.84s)]
*  but one of the reasons me as an American, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5515.200000000001s)]
*  me as a protector, me as a father, me as a husband, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5518.56s)]
*  it is my job and my responsibility [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5521.360000000001s)]
*  to be prepared to protect my family. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5522.96s)]
*  And as your children learn via osmosis, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5525.64s)]
*  like by example, the things that you do, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5529.160000000001s)]
*  I have to like elbow my son out of a seat [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5532.76s)]
*  so I can sit facing the door. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5534.84s)]
*  I was like, my man, you knew where to sit, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5536.48s)]
*  but like move over, you go sit by your mom right now. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5538.719999999999s)]
*  And he sees the outliers. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5541.719999999999s)]
*  Mike would call it a bump in the pattern. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5546.04s)]
*  Like I call them outliers where like something is off [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5549.16s)]
*  where I sit down in a place and like, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5552.08s)]
*  that person doesn't belong here. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5555.28s)]
*  Right, what's going on here? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5556.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna spend a little bit of time [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5558.12s)]
*  and a little cognitive of my ever struggling brain [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5560.679999999999s)]
*  to pay attention with this, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5566.0s)]
*  what person is doing over here, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5566.96s)]
*  because it's my responsibility. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5568.68s)]
*  And Americans better figure this out pretty fast [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5571.240000000001s)]
*  because we are gonna have a rough year. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5574.72s)]
*  We are woefully unprepared and disillusioned [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5578.8s)]
*  about what the next 13 months are gonna look like. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5583.320000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's gonna wake people up? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5586.04s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, I do not wanna say [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5588.08s)]
*  that we need something to happen, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5590.84s)]
*  but one of the things that did happen post 9-11, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5592.64s)]
*  I remember this overwhelming feeling of patriotism [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5596.280000000001s)]
*  that was prevalent through the entire country. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5600.200000000001s)]
*  I would drive to work and I'd see American flags [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5603.360000000001s)]
*  on fucking, in Los Angeles, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5605.68s)]
*  which is like one of the most ridiculously [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5608.6s)]
*  out of touch places on earth. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5611.12s)]
*  And everyone had American flags hanging from their car. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5613.160000000001s)]
*  It was overwhelming. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5616.280000000001s)]
*  There was this feeling like we are in this together. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5618.4800000000005s)]
*  And that there are forces of evil out there in the world [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5623.32s)]
*  and now we understand and now we're united. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5624.719999999999s)]
*  I hope that we don't need that catalyst. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5628.28s)]
*  I hope so too. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5631.04s)]
*  I really do. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5631.879999999999s)]
*  But. But. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5633.5199999999995s)]
*  Israel is one of the most secure nations in the world. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5636.5199999999995s)]
*  Which is impressive from them fighting for their existence [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5642.12s)]
*  the day that they became a country [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5646.4s)]
*  to the six day war where every single one [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5648.32s)]
*  of their neighboring countries invaded them. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5650.96s)]
*  To the Yom Kippur war where again, led by Egypt, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5652.84s)]
*  every single one of their neighboring countries [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5655.76s)]
*  invaded them. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5657.44s)]
*  To what just happened where they have one of the most [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5658.36s)]
*  complex security and military and intelligent networks [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5662.0s)]
*  on the planet. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5666.0s)]
*  And Hamas killed almost Pearl Harbor level numbers, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5668.08s)]
*  almost 9-11 level numbers just in a number of days. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5672.68s)]
*  In an indescribably barbaric way. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5681.0s)]

*  are somehow safe, that the government is somehow [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5750.7s)]
*  going to protect us, that our local police department, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5753.0s)]
*  like if you picked up the phone right now [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5755.72s)]
*  and you called for help, 911, how long would it take [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5757.24s)]

*  And you have a ton of friends that are in law enforcement [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5773.16s)]
*  in this area. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5775.320000000001s)]
*  The murder detectives counter gang task forces [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5776.400000000001s)]
*  are pulled off of their murder investigations [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5780.76s)]
*  to work the street because they don't have [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5784.08s)]
*  enough police officers. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5785.84s)]
*  I've mentioned the recruiting crisis. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5789.12s)]
*  If we are struggling to meet the demand of basic soldiers, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5792.64s)]
*  the available population of combat arms [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5797.4800000000005s)]
*  that special operations can pick from, that shrinks, right? [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5801.360000000001s)]
*  And then that pool being smaller. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5804.12s)]
*  So ultimately, by the time you get to the guys [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5806.26s)]
*  that really do the work on the ground, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5808.56s)]
*  there's nobody left to pick from. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5810.400000000001s)]
*  And we're not just strategically in maybe [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5812.52s)]
*  the most vulnerable position in a really long time, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5816.400000000001s)]
*  but nationally here in the United States, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5818.56s)]
*  I think that we are more vulnerable than we have ever been. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5821.0s)]
*  There's nobody coming to save you. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5824.0s)]

*  that's gonna pick up the phone and be like, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5826.92s)]
*  "'Yeah, I'll be there in three minutes.'" [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5828.32s)]
*  They're not coming. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5831.04s)]
*  It took six to eight hours for any of the military [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5832.56s)]
*  or police to make it to any of those villages [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5837.18s)]
*  that are immediately adjacent from Gaza [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5840.2s)]
*  to come and try and fight Hamas back. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5842.38s)]
*  They had six hours to do whatever they want [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5844.4s)]
*  to all the women, the children, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5848.5199999999995s)]
*  and the Holocaust survivors that were still there. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5850.679999999999s)]
*  Like these were people that survived Holocaust camps, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5852.919999999999s)]
*  concentration camps of World War II, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5856.719999999999s)]
*  still alive, 102 years old. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5858.2s)]
*  And they're like, Hamas is like, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5860.08s)]
*  "'We knew that you were here. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5862.12s)]

*  And Americans are woefully ill-prepared for what's coming. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5871.36s)]
*  I think there's another thing that's disturbing to me, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5876.32s)]
*  but there's a certain amount of cowardice [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5880.5199999999995s)]
*  that's involved in, there's certain people [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5883.799999999999s)]
*  that when they see an attack like that happen [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5887.48s)]

*  They would try to sympathize [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5897.639999999999s)]
*  and almost position themselves to be on their side. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5898.92s)]
*  That's rampant right now. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5902.56s)]
*  The anti-Semitism across the United States. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5904.68s)]

*  It's like they were hiding in the woods [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5911.120000000001s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you're seeing it openly. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5912.88s)]
*  I saw one where it was like, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5917.360000000001s)]
*  we should boycott Jewish businesses here in the United States. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5919.240000000001s)]
*  And I was like, maybe just have them [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5923.64s)]
*  put a star on their chest or something [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5926.160000000001s)]

*  Evidently we haven't. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5935.04s)]
*  It took 6 million to being persecuted in kid. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5936.6s)]
*  I mean, those Jews, man, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5939.88s)]
*  from the Germans to the Egyptians to the Romans, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5941.52s)]
*  Palestine didn't exist. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5946.88s)]
*  You could go back 3000 years to King David [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5948.16s)]
*  and then his son, King Solomon, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5951.72s)]
*  saying that like, this is the capital of the Jewish people [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5953.52s)]

*  We have to go to AD, AD, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5964.959999999999s)]
*  where after Jesus has already come here, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5967.4s)]
*  now we have the origin of Judaism and them, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5969.0s)]
*  historically, not religious documents, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5973.2s)]

*  to then being the origin of the Christian faith [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5982.2s)]
*  with Jesus being there and then being crucified. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5984.599999999999s)]
*  And then 200 years later, Muhammad and us learning [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5987.68s)]
*  that the Muslim religion also beginning there, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5993.56s)]
*  the Romans destroy the temple in AD, AD, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=5997.76s)]
*  and then they coined the term Palestine for that area. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6002.12s)]
*  For the 2000 years before that, it had just been Israel. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6007.54s)]

*  Murdered at every opportunity, leading up to the Holocaust. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6023.72s)]
*  Going to post-World War II, 1947, the UN says, [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6027.32s)]
*  hey, it's cool that Israel has its own nation [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6031.76s)]

*  I would have never imagined this just five, six years ago. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6060.98s)]
*  Never imagined. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6064.08s)]
*  Five, six months ago. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6065.0s)]
*  Yeah, right, yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6066.08s)]
*  100,000 people in London, you know, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6070.48s)]
*  marching, tearing down posters. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6073.9s)]
*  And I've asked this time and time again, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6078.179999999999s)]
*  you know, there's posters of the kids [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6080.66s)]

*  And they put them up in New York, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6083.62s)]
*  they put them up in Brooklyn, they put them in LA. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6085.0s)]
*  And there are hundreds of videos of people walking down [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6086.9s)]
*  to tear off these hostage photographs. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6090.339999999999s)]
*  Young people. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6092.54s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6093.94s)]
*  I wanna know why. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6096.5s)]
*  Like, why don't you want to see a picture [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6097.94s)]
*  of a nine-year-old girl that was kidnapped [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6100.54s)]
*  and is now a hostage by a terrorist group in Gaza? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6104.26s)]
*  Why don't you wanna see that? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6108.9s)]
*  Why are you tearing that down? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6109.94s)]
*  And I think that the answer is, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6112.72s)]
*  it goes in direct conflict [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6116.62s)]
*  with the thing that they want to believe. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6119.54s)]
*  And they think that it perpetuates a cycle of violence [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6121.94s)]
*  and that them tearing it down, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6124.7s)]
*  and that is them, like, protecting the Palestinian [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6126.36s)]
*  poor, impoverished people, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6130.679999999999s)]
*  when in fact, they're tearing down the victim, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6132.799999999999s)]
*  the Jew, or the Christian, or the Brazilian [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6136.16s)]
*  that was kidnapped, that is now being held hostage in Gaza [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6139.759999999999s)]
*  by a terrorist group of people and thugs. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6143.16s)]
*  Why are you tearing that down? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6146.88s)]
*  Well, there's this very bizarre progressive narrative [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6150.339999999999s)]
*  that, you know, look, there's a reality of Gaza [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6154.04s)]
*  that Gaza is essentially like an open-air prison. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6159.08s)]
*  That is a reality. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6162.68s)]
*  Those people are fucked. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6163.84s)]
*  They're stuck there. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6164.88s)]
*  And it doesn't seem to be, like, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6165.72s)]
*  a really good solution on the table. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6166.92s)]
*  You know, and I don't know what can be done, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6169.28s)]
*  especially now, to change that. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6172.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6174.12s)]
*  That is true. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6175.38s)]
*  And there is a hostility, a deep hostility [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6176.46s)]
*  between the Israelis and the Palestinians on both sides. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6178.56s)]
*  It's palpable. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6182.8s)]
*  I've seen many videos of atrocities [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6184.08s)]
*  being committed by both sides, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6186.4s)]
*  which is just a horrible consequence of war and conflict. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6188.2s)]
*  What do you think, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6191.44s)]
*  I'm Israel, you're the Palestinians in Gaza, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6194.08s)]
*  if every one of the people in Gaza [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6198.1s)]
*  laid down the arms and stopped attacking, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6204.28s)]
*  what would I, Israel, do to you? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6209.12s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6212.76s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6217.6s)]
*  They've tried it five different times. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6220.44s)]
*  They're literally like, stop attacking. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6224.2s)]
*  Israel has never, not one time in history, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6226.88s)]
*  initiated any conflict. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6231.28s)]
*  Every single one of those things that you're pointing to [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6232.68s)]
*  is a retaliatory attack by a terrorist organization. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6234.9s)]
*  But if that was switched, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6238.64s)]
*  where I, Israel, you, Hamas, in Gaza, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6241.7s)]
*  I take all of my arms and all of my protection [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6247.62s)]
*  and I laid them down, what would Hamas do? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6250.5s)]
*  They would kill every single one of us. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6255.58s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6257.9s)]
*  That's what they're sworn to do. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6258.9s)]
*  That's their motto and the origin of their existence [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6260.5s)]
*  all the way back to the Grand Mufti, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6264.0599999999995s)]
*  traveling to Hitler to ask, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6265.86s)]
*  how do we solve the Jewish problem? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6268.34s)]
*  Like you want to follow from the Hamas [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6271.38s)]
*  to the Muslim Brotherhood [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6273.22s)]
*  all the way back to the Grand Mufti, to Mujahideen, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6274.9s)]
*  and you see the origins of one thing, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6277.34s)]
*  which is how do I solve the Jewish problem, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6279.94s)]
*  is to eradicate and kill them. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6281.62s)]
*  That is what Hamas came from. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6283.74s)]
*  Not the Palestinians, not those poor people stuck in Gaza. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6285.6s)]
*  But in that problem, if all of Hamas just went away, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6290.08s)]
*  we would have peace. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6294.74s)]
*  If they laid down their arms [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6296.18s)]
*  and they stopped murdering innocent civilians [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6297.4s)]
*  and raping women and killing babies, you'd have peace. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6299.36s)]
*  If the other side laid down their arms, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6304.08s)]
*  they would all be murdered, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6307.28s)]
*  all seven and a half million of them, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6308.88s)]
*  until they just were walking in blood [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6311.48s)]
*  through the Jordan River. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6313.54s)]
*  How do you solve this problem? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6315.799999999999s)]
*  The radicals have to be eliminated. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6318.44s)]
*  The terrorists have to go away. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6321.08s)]
*  That is not, I'm not conflating the Palestinians [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6322.92s)]
*  and the terrorists. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6327.08s)]
*  Those are separate things. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6328.04s)]
*  But if there's two and a half million people [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6330.0s)]
*  that are living in Gaza, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6332.22s)]
*  that are allowing 30,000 terrorists to run them, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6333.24s)]
*  at some point, the olive branch cannot be extended [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6339.82s)]
*  from Israel when 30,000 people are using that region [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6343.24s)]
*  to launch attacks into their sovereign nation. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6346.32s)]
*  And we were talking about the propaganda [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6349.0s)]
*  that exists in America. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6350.96s)]
*  What about the propaganda that exists in Palestine? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6352.96s)]
*  I mean, what is their thought? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6355.36s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6356.88s)]
*  So like, did you see the hospital that got destroyed? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6358.56s)]
*  Well, it didn't really, right? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6362.64s)]
*  No, it did not really. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6363.92s)]
*  No, but the New York Times said it did. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6364.8s)]
*  The New York Times said it was an Israel. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6366.92s)]
*  And Congresswomen. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6367.76s)]
*  Which is insane, and they didn't retract it. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6369.08s)]
*  They said it was- You take Horstewormer [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6372.12s)]
*  and Israel destroyed a hospital. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6374.6s)]
*  So evil. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6379.14s)]
*  It's so crazy that they printed that in the New York Times. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6380.72s)]
*  I mean, that's the paper of record. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6383.68s)]
*  That's the most important newspaper [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6385.08s)]
*  that we have in America, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6386.6s)]
*  in terms of if we wanted an objective source [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6387.96s)]
*  of information, most people say, what's the best? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6390.32s)]
*  Look, I used to deliver the New York Times [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6393.5199999999995s)]
*  when I was a kid. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6396.2s)]
*  And I did it, it wasn't even that profitable. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6398.12s)]
*  I delivered the Boston Globe as my main newspaper [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6400.82s)]
*  that I delivered. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6403.36s)]
*  And then I delivered the Boston Herald as well. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6404.2s)]
*  And then I got a New York Times route, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6406.32s)]
*  and I was proud of that, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6408.4s)]
*  because the New York Times was the real newspaper [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6410.04s)]
*  that intelligent people read. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6412.5s)]
*  And it was a different plastic wrapper. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6414.52s)]
*  You got a clear wrapper for the Herald [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6417.96s)]
*  and a clear wrapper for the Globe. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6422.320000000001s)]
*  But for the New York Times, I got a blue wrapper. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6424.0s)]
*  And I was one of the people that got to deliver [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6426.88s)]
*  the New York Times. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6428.84s)]
*  And I remember thinking as a 20-year-old kid, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6429.84s)]
*  like, oh boy, I'm delivering the New York Times. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6432.68s)]
*  And when I would drop the paper off [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6435.280000000001s)]
*  at these people's houses, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6437.320000000001s)]
*  I was like, that's a fucking smart house. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6438.160000000001s)]
*  These people are reading the New York Times in Boston. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6440.040000000001s)]
*  And I remember thinking that. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6442.64s)]
*  I was proud of that, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6443.68s)]
*  that I delivered the best newspaper in the world. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6445.52s)]
*  Really, I literally wasn't that much money, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6448.0s)]
*  and it was a crazy route, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6450.84s)]
*  because I'd have to go like a mile in between houses. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6451.9400000000005s)]
*  Whereas with the Boston Globe, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6454.900000000001s)]
*  I'd have like five, six houses on one street [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6456.64s)]
*  that I would drop off papers to. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6459.66s)]
*  And the New York Times, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6461.8s)]
*  I'd have this fucking crazy route. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6462.64s)]
*  I'd have to go all over the place [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6464.12s)]
*  to get rid of 100 newspapers. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6465.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then now in 2023, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6467.72s)]
*  they're circulating terrorist propaganda. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6469.64s)]
*  Yeah, and with no- [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6472.84s)]
*  With no recourse. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6475.92s)]
*  No repercussions. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6476.76s)]
*  And what do they make? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6478.2s)]
*  Do they even print a retraction? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6480.28s)]
*  Do they say, we fucked up? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6481.68s)]
*  You watch a missile get launched from Gaza. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6483.32s)]
*  You know, one third of all missiles [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6486.16s)]
*  that are launched from Gaza land in Gaza. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6487.92s)]
*  Do you think about how sad that is? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6491.24s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6494.08s)]
*  28% of missiles launched from Hamas [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6494.92s)]
*  land on top of the Palestinian people. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6498.24s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6500.24s)]
*  And obviously they have no ability [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6501.32s)]
*  to direct any military target [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6502.92s)]
*  when these crappy missiles are being launched into Israel. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6505.84s)]
*  They're just like populated area. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6509.26s)]
*  Populated. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6511.76s)]
*  I went and did a Fox News standup in the city [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6512.6s)]
*  directly north of Gaza. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6518.36s)]
*  That is the most rocketed city in all of Israel. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6519.8s)]
*  And then like the one day that we were there, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6522.68s)]
*  we had like six rocket attack sirens go off. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6524.58s)]
*  You know, it's the weirdest thing [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6528.52s)]
*  that the Palestinians are allowing Hamas [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6532.0s)]
*  to literally kill them and pillage everything [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6538.04s)]
*  about their existence from them. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6541.04s)]
*  Hamas is so rich and so powerful. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6542.92s)]
*  70 million dollars from Iran. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6546.0s)]
*  You know, every humanitarian ship [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6548.400000000001s)]
*  that comes into the port or right now [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6550.68s)]
*  that is being brought up through the Rafah gate via Egypt [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6552.64s)]
*  into the south portion of Gaza, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6555.56s)]
*  the moment that lands there [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6558.66s)]
*  that is taken control of by Hamas. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6559.5s)]
*  They then build underground infrastructure in the tunnels [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6561.7s)]
*  and they build military infrastructure. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6565.42s)]
*  And then they turn as whatever they can into rockets [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6567.38s)]
*  and the humanitarian aid that is supposed to be distributed [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6570.42s)]
*  to the people they have control of. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6573.9s)]
*  Like they have to go. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6577.3s)]
*  Not the Palestinians. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6579.86s)]
*  They have been so screwed by Hamas [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6581.74s)]
*  but the propaganda that they encounter in Palestine [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6587.7s)]
*  has to be insane. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6593.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they believe that they're on the good side. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6594.179999999999s)]
*  How do they sift through fact from fiction [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6603.74s)]
*  when what they're being told and being fed [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6607.62s)]
*  is being fed to them by Hamas? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6610.099999999999s)]
*  Like how do you... [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6612.5s)]
*  How do they get access to other information? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6615.5s)]
*  And how do they ever organize and discuss this openly [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6620.9400000000005s)]
*  without fear of losing their lives and being tortured? [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6626.42s)]
*  The only time that you had consistent water and power [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6629.620000000001s)]
*  going into Gaza was when Israel was controlling Gaza. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6633.06s)]
*  Now that Hamas is running it, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6636.780000000001s)]
*  it is just, it is nightmarish in there [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6639.620000000001s)]
*  but they're still in charge and they're being protected. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6645.58s)]
*  And here in the United States being like [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6648.46s)]
*  called freedom fighters, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6651.34s)]
*  like they are barbaric murderers and absolute terrorists [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6652.9800000000005s)]
*  that want nothing besides the genocide of... [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6657.14s)]
*  When I saw like the LGBTQ flags of LGBTQ stands [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6661.46s)]
*  with Hamas, mind is blown. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6666.9s)]
*  Isn't it hilarious that you... [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6671.18s)]
*  Have you ever seen that meme that it says [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6672.62s)]
*  queers for Palestine and then Palestine for queers? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6675.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6681.02s)]
*  They wouldn't live there like hours. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6683.1s)]
*  They'd be pushed off a rooftop or burnt alive immediately. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6686.9800000000005s)]
*  But they don't, but the narrative in this country [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6691.42s)]
*  is not that, which is so strange. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6693.58s)]
*  That like there's sort of overwhelming evidence [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6697.22s)]
*  about the approach that they have to gay people. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6700.22s)]
*  But yet somehow or another, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6703.46s)]
*  there's this I stand with Palestine thing [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6705.62s)]
*  that makes you a progressive. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6708.38s)]
*  Go to Tel Aviv as a gay person, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6709.82s)]
*  walk around with your gay pride shirt, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6712.42s)]
*  with your husband or wife of the same sex. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6714.78s)]
*  Nobody will bat an eye at you. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6719.38s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6720.9s)]
*  Everybody's like, what up? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6722.7s)]
*  Like normal. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6724.58s)]
*  Man, if she and her wife tried to walk down the road [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6726.820000000001s)]
*  in Gaza, bro, man. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6732.14s)]
*  It is so this tinderbox that is that region [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6737.38s)]
*  with the West Bank, with the Gom Heights of the North, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6741.700000000001s)]
*  with Hezbollah, which has been supported by Iran. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6744.860000000001s)]
*  They're all positioned on the border, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6747.18s)]
*  with Iraq allowing people from Afghanistan to Taliban [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6749.06s)]
*  to move through. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6751.860000000001s)]
*  Taliban being funded by us, $40 million right now [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6753.14s)]
*  is what we're continually giving them, the Taliban. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6756.860000000001s)]
*  Why do we do that? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6759.660000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6760.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6763.14s)]
*  What's the cynical side of you? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6764.700000000001s)]
*  We want to recognize them as a legitimate government [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6768.740000000001s)]
*  and we are paying for them to start, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6771.46s)]
*  to start a democratic process of like that is the, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6777.700000000001s)]
*  I think would be the tagline of what we want them to do. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6782.38s)]
*  What it is actually doing is the same thing that happens [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6787.82s)]
*  when we release $6 billion to Iran [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6789.9800000000005s)]
*  in exchange for hostages. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6792.78s)]
*  They then take that $6 billion. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6794.42s)]
*  No, they're not using that exact money [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6796.54s)]
*  to fund terrorism with Hezbollah or Hamas, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6798.66s)]
*  but I have one bank account [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6802.46s)]
*  that has an additional $6 billion in it. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6804.02s)]
*  And now I'm able to spend $6 billion over here [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6806.38s)]
*  to finance other things that are gonna destabilize [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6809.3s)]
*  the nation that I have sworn to eradicate, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6813.22s)]
*  Israel and America. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6815.62s)]
*  So like, cool. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6817.54s)]
*  I'll happily give some more money to, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6818.62s)]
*  they've been planning this for four years. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=6820.860000000001s)]

*  And then when there's nothing to worry about, then they hit you with climate change. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7254.64s)]
*  When there's nothing to worry about, then they hit you with something else. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7257.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7259.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a constant barrage of things to occupy your attention. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7260.98s)]
*  And meanwhile, decisions are being made that slowly erode everything this country is supposed [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7265.139999999999s)]
*  to be founded for. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7270.459999999999s)]
*  We are the greatest nation to exist in the history of mankind. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7274.099999999999s)]
*  And in the cycle of dynasties, of empires, we're at the right limit of the average one [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7280.459999999999s)]
*  of those. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7288.54s)]
*  And Rome didn't die in a day. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7290.22s)]
*  It was a slow decay of the things that made them special. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7295.9400000000005s)]

*  And I will be positive and I will be hopeful that how do we fix this? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7309.900000000001s)]
*  What do you think, Joe? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7314.66s)]
*  What are the things that an individual can do in a day? [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7315.66s)]
*  It seems so insurmountable, right? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7318.52s)]
*  Like, oh, Tim, like I can't fix Congress. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7319.88s)]
*  Like I don't get to pick the next president. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7322.02s)]
*  I, I'm only in charge of me. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7323.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7326.52s)]
*  Be in charge of you. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7327.52s)]
*  What does that look like? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7328.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7329.52s)]
*  We need a polar shift in the understanding of the importance of that. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7330.52s)]
*  And I don't think you're getting that from many places. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7334.72s)]
*  And I think really the only way you're getting that from individuals like you speaking about [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7338.0s)]
*  it, people talking about it online, people that aren't captured by these massive institutions, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7341.84s)]
*  and corporations that do have a very specific narrative that they're discussing always and [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7348.48s)]
*  constantly that you're not getting this kind of, these kinds of conversations. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7354.2s)]
*  They don't exist in the mainstream news. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7359.639999999999s)]
*  They don't exist anywhere else other than independent media. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7362.0s)]
*  And that's what's so strange. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7366.28s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons why independent media has become so huge is because people [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7368.08s)]
*  are confused. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7372.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, why am I not being told what's really going on in some sort of an objective [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7374.160000000001s)]
*  sense? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7380.360000000001s)]
*  Why am I not being informed of all the variety of things that are playing against the things [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7381.360000000001s)]
*  that make this country great? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7389.8s)]
*  Why is the concept of freedom being downplayed as some sort of a far right perspective, which [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7392.0s)]
*  is so strange. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7400.120000000001s)]
*  So strange. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7402.4400000000005s)]
*  Fitness is far right. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7404.36s)]
*  Eating healthy is far. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7405.36s)]
*  Eating is racist. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7406.36s)]
*  Eating healthy is racist. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7407.36s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7410.36s)]
*  It's so crazy that they've managed to marginalize almost every positive thing and put it into [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7412.24s)]
*  a category of either racist or discriminatory or homophobic or whatever the fuck it is. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7417.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a fascinating, not a study, example of China combating information-wise. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7427.36s)]
*  So like TikTok, the advertisements that are being fed to let's say a 14-year-old boy, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7434.759999999999s)]
*  he's seen like soft porn, he's seen like scantily clad girls, he's seen like drug vape things. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7441.0s)]
*  In America, that is the constant ad that he's being fed. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7451.44s)]
*  Like go and party, be a TikTok star, be a YouTube influencer. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7456.04s)]
*  These are the things he's being fed nonstop. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7459.5199999999995s)]
*  That exact same age person in China on a China app, they're talking about becoming a strong [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7462.7s)]
*  contributing member of the Chinese society, being good in school, being a good athlete. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7468.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, scientific accomplishments. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7474.84s)]
*  Night and day, A and B. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7476.84s)]
*  A, America, they're fed things that destroy the individual. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7479.32s)]
*  B, in China, they're being fed things that make the individual stronger and a better [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7483.400000000001s)]
*  person in that society. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7487.96s)]
*  But the only way that you can get that is you have to give the government control and [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7489.4800000000005s)]
*  the government has to be doing it for the overall good of the nation. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7495.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what their perspective is. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7500.16s)]
*  When they're trying to make stronger Chinese citizens, they're doing it because of a very [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7501.72s)]
*  specific government mandate that's trying to strengthen China. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7507.04s)]
*  They want their men to be more manly. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7510.66s)]
*  They want all these things to take place that will strengthen their nation. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7513.16s)]
*  Yeah, and what do they want from Americans? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7516.759999999999s)]
*  They want us to be weaker. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7519.5599999999995s)]
*  They want us to be weaker. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7520.5599999999995s)]

*  They want us to be more mentally unwell. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7522.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think people realize that that's what it is. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7523.5599999999995s)]
*  I think when people are trying to be a TikTok influencer, what are they saying? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7527.599999999999s)]
*  Well, they're saying, well, I don't want to work in a fucking insurance company. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7531.24s)]
*  Like what other job can I make? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7534.44s)]
*  Oh, can I just like make wild, wacky videos of me eating and I can make more money than [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7535.599999999999s)]

*  now. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7564.639999999999s)]
*  You go to two years of trade school to become an electrician, right? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7566.76s)]
*  You spend a year and a half to as an apprentice and then you go and you start working for [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7570.64s)]

*  They don't hear it anywhere, which is crazy. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7712.16s)]
*  They hear it from a few places. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7714.36s)]
*  But I look at like the Evans, you know, Black Rifle Coffee. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7715.36s)]

*  Like we could just go down the list of all of these guys that just grabbed the reins [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7728.28s)]
*  of their horse and started directing it in the thing that they were passionate about [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7733.08s)]
*  with discipline, a process and hard work. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7737.24s)]
*  Those three things yet again. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7739.8s)]

*  And I'm like so proud to call them friends. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7742.76s)]
*  But more importantly, I'm so proud that they're Americans because that's the idea. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7744.76s)]
*  And it's not it's not this unattainable thing. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7749.28s)]
*  Like you're calling it unattainable because you don't want to do the work necessary to [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7752.68s)]
*  be successful at it. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7755.88s)]
*  Wasn't Mike Glover put on some very fucking bizarre list? [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7757.44s)]
*  Yeah, he was called a radical extremist by the FBI. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7761.0s)]
*  Because he was telling people how to can food and pickle things that you should be prepared [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7766.96s)]
*  in case something goes south. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7770.88s)]
*  Yeah, they thought bizarre is that this administration would and will not call Hamas the radical [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7772.4800000000005s)]
*  extremist violent extremist organization and terrorist organization that they are, but [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7781.04s)]
*  will call mega people radical insurrectionists. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7785.32s)]
*  The two party justice thing that we got going on right now that is dangerous for a republic. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7792.92s)]
*  Mike Glover is an amazing dude. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7803.12s)]
*  He served his country for 20 years. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7804.36s)]
*  You know, he was my boss for a little bit on the special operations side. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7806.0s)]
*  We went to sniper school together, saved my butt in sniper school. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7809.08s)]
*  Do you know the story? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7813.08s)]
*  No. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7815.4s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7816.4s)]
*  Not that I need to like talk about how amazing Mike Glover is, but he's an amazing human. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7817.4s)]
*  All those dudes, you know, Andy, like Mike Cerelli, like just great people. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7821.72s)]
*  So I'm writing a book right now called The Purpose of Pain. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7825.76s)]
*  And my sniper partner during sniper school, he is dealing with a bunch of stuff, trauma [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7829.68s)]
*  from his last appointment. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7836.08s)]
*  And I am such a selfish little prick. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7837.8s)]
*  I am more concerned about being like the number one shooter in the school than my brother [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7840.92s)]
*  that is next to me every single day. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7845.64s)]
*  Right? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7847.68s)]
*  Like, we're sitting here on a stock. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7848.68s)]
*  I'm with him for 20, 30 hours at a time. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7850.68s)]
*  And we're sitting here looking at the back of a tree. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7854.280000000001s)]
*  We're discussing every single thing, but I'm not listening into what he's actually telling [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7856.400000000001s)]
*  me. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7861.12s)]
*  And he's pouring it all out there because I'm too concerned with like, you know, being [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7862.12s)]
*  special forces sniper school on our graduate or something stupid that I was at the time. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7865.76s)]
*  Ultimately, during the field shoot, which is a must pass event during sniper school, [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7870.64s)]
*  in the middle of it, he stands up and he quits. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7875.56s)]
*  He just stands up and says he makes a wind call in the opposite of the wind direction. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7878.64s)]
*  So I see a left to right. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7883.22s)]
*  So we should take the target, dissect it and hold into the wind. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7884.3s)]
*  So the bullet travels and hit the target. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7888.42s)]
*  Right? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7890.04s)]
*  So I see a left to right and he gives me a right call. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7891.04s)]
*  And I was like, hey, man, give me a different call. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7893.12s)]
*  You're missing this. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7897.72s)]
*  And he's like, I'm freaking out. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7898.96s)]
*  And I see his eyes start like darting around and he's just like getting the pressure and [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7900.88s)]
*  he stands up. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7905.08s)]
*  He's like, I quit. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7906.08s)]
*  In the middle of sniper school. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7907.08s)]
*  And so the instructors are like, all right, Tim, you're out. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7909.42s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not out. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7911.24s)]
*  Like I still got a shot. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7912.72s)]
*  Such a selfish prick. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7914.16s)]
*  I just want to go back to that 26 year old kid and smash him in the face. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7915.16s)]
*  Anyways, so I'm like, I'm going to graduate. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7920.24s)]
*  I just need a bullet and a target. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7925.72s)]
*  I could do it right now. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7928.16s)]
*  Let me lay down. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7929.16s)]
*  I'll make my own wind call. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7930.16s)]
*  Like this is sniper school. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7931.16s)]
*  It's you and a partner. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7932.16s)]
*  So they walk over to the people that have already shot and they say, Hey, I need one [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7933.56s)]
*  person to volunteer for Tim with one target, with one bullet. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7938.56s)]
*  It's a go no go. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7943.280000000001s)]
*  He gets a first round hit. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7944.280000000001s)]
*  He graduates. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7945.280000000001s)]
*  He misses. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7946.280000000001s)]
*  He's out of school. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7947.280000000001s)]
*  And this is to like the pool of people. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7948.84s)]
*  Mike Glover's hand pops up. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7950.56s)]
*  I know him. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7953.52s)]
*  We're both in this special mission, like this, this unit called the CRIF, the SIF at the [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7954.76s)]
*  time, the Command, Commanders and Extremist Force. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7958.72s)]
*  It's a special operations, counterterrorism, hostage rescue unit within special forces. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7961.28s)]
*  So like it's a very small pool of people. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7965.599999999999s)]
*  So I knew who he was and his hand goes up. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7968.4s)]
*  The instructor, check this. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7970.92s)]
*  He goes, okay, what if your graduation depends on this shot? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7972.08s)]
*  Mike's words wouldn't change my answer. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7976.96s)]
*  I don't know him. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7980.2s)]
*  I've never shot with him. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7981.2s)]
*  He volunteers and effectively puts his graduation go no go of special forces sniper school on [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7982.38s)]
*  me to come and lay down with me to make a shot. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7987.62s)]
*  So they get me an M118LR. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7990.6s)]
*  It's a 175 grain match grade bullet for my 308 and they walk over and they go, here's [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7992.96s)]
*  your bullet. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=7998.88s)]
*  There's your target. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8000.08s)]
*  So we measure it. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8001.360000000001s)]
*  It's slightly over 700 meters. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8003.56s)]
*  We get our wind call. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8006.200000000001s)]
*  We take the shot. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8007.56s)]
*  And as the bullet travels, you see a thing called trace. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8008.56s)]
*  It's the displacement of vapor in the air. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8011.160000000001s)]
*  And it looks like this laser beam. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8012.76s)]
*  And when you're shooting really far, especially with a large kind of slower bullet, 2,600 feet [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8014.04s)]
*  per second for a 175 grain bullet. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8018.28s)]
*  And that you see this laser going directly towards the target. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8020.679999999999s)]
*  So the moment I press that trigger, Mike's like center center hit before it even hits, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8025.2s)]
*  right? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8030.5199999999995s)]
*  Before we even see that impact of that 40 by 20 target and you see the splash, but it [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8031.5199999999995s)]
*  takes three, four seconds for the sound of the impact to reach us. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8037.0s)]

*  And that knife is just like sitting underneath my body armor. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8471.599999999999s)]
*  And thankfully I never had to use it. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8474.56s)]
*  But it would also been a picture I would have sent to Josh. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8477.279999999999s)]
*  He'd be like, dude, I don't want to see this. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8481.759999999998s)]
*  You are such a psychopath. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8484.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8486.16s)]
*  It would have been a blast though. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8487.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8488.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8489.16s)]
*  He probably doesn't want to see that. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8490.16s)]
*  But it's it's just insane that kind of censorship. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8491.16s)]
*  And I don't understand it. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8495.32s)]
*  I don't understand who it's like who is following him in the first place. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8497.0s)]
*  I mean, he makes a hunting knife. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8501.84s)]
*  It's a hunting knife company. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8504.52s)]
*  Who does it benefit from the censor? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8505.52s)]
*  Me and I don't understand it. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8508.36s)]
*  It's leftist people that are involved in these organizations that have a very specific ideology [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8511.24s)]
*  that they adhere to. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8517.32s)]
*  And they think that anybody who is pro-America is in some way, shape or form negative. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8518.8s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8526.32s)]
*  And I'm sure I'm on some of those lists. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8527.48s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8529.44s)]

*  You're kind of too big to mess with. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8534.28s)]
*  It's odd. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8536.48s)]

*  I mean, he's a publicly traded company that is filled with people that are in the tech [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8549.960000000001s)]
*  industry. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8555.960000000001s)]

*  And I had a conversation with Elon about it last night where we discussed it. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8561.92s)]
*  He calls he says it's a death cult. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8564.960000000001s)]
*  So these people are in a death cult. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8567.52s)]
*  They think that there should be less human beings. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8568.720000000001s)]
*  They think the human beings are the problem. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8570.800000000001s)]
*  And they they just have this specific ideology that they want to push on everyone and anything [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8572.68s)]
*  that's even remotely opposed to that, like hunting. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8581.720000000001s)]
*  Most of these how many people fucking eat meat? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8585.76s)]
*  And somehow or another, they think that hunting somehow or another is in opposition to this [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8588.84s)]
*  leftist position. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8594.160000000002s)]

*  They wanted to quit. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8676.72s)]
*  They wanted to quit. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8677.72s)]
*  Like we'll just do 10 minutes. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8678.72s)]
*  I go, fuck that. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8679.72s)]
*  I go, you do in 20 minutes. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8680.72s)]
*  I threw water on the rocks. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8681.72s)]
*  I go, now let's make it harder. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8683.039999999999s)]
*  I go, we're going to do 20 minutes, man. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8684.039999999999s)]
*  And I go, when it's done, you're going to feel good that you got through those 20 minutes [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8685.76s)]
*  because those last 10 are going to suck. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8688.64s)]
*  Because you get in the first couple of minutes like, this is not that bad. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8690.24s)]
*  I go, right. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8693.359999999999s)]
*  It's not that bad yet. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8694.359999999999s)]
*  Wait till 10 minutes comes around. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8695.359999999999s)]
*  10 minutes is going to, you're going to feel uncomfortable. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8697.359999999999s)]
*  But you can survive it. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8700.24s)]
*  And you just have to learn how to just accept the fact that you're suffering. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8701.519999999999s)]
*  Just deal with it. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8706.48s)]
*  That's so awesome. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8708.24s)]
*  And then they get in the cold plunge afterwards. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8709.24s)]
*  In the beginning, he could only do like a minute. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8711.4s)]
*  He's like, fuck this. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8713.119999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, listen, man, it's all in your mind. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8714.119999999999s)]
*  And you're going to realize that when you do it a second time and a third time. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8716.72s)]
*  And now he's doing three minutes. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8719.88s)]
*  And now he gets in there. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8720.88s)]
*  So he gets in that endorphin, serotonin, dopamine pump. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8721.88s)]
*  He said, dude, it's like I'm on Molly. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8724.56s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8726.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8727.039999999999s)]
*  Because what happens is your endorphins, your dopamine ramps up by 200% naturally in a healthy [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8728.039999999999s)]
*  way. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8734.16s)]
*  It makes you nicer to people that you run into. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8735.16s)]
*  You feel better. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8736.88s)]
*  And it lasts for hours and hours throughout the day. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8737.88s)]
*  Here's the Stanford neuroscientist. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8740.48s)]
*  Huberman. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8742.68s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8743.68s)]
*  He did a podcast on the benefits and also the approach and methodology and process of [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8744.68s)]
*  cold plunging and sauna. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8748.88s)]
*  And I just copied and pasted that whole entire, yet again, here it is, discipline, process [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8751.0s)]
*  and hard work. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8759.32s)]
*  I took his process the way that he recommended to do this for both sauna and cold plunge. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8760.32s)]
*  Just life changing. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8765.0s)]
*  Huberman got censored by Wikipedia. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8766.0s)]
*  You know what happened? [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8769.199999999999s)]
*  I had Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on my podcast and Huberman made a comment. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8770.92s)]
*  And that comment was, I hope that more presidential candidates submit to long term conversations [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=8775.0s)]

*  No real background in grappling. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9130.92s)]
*  He goes and out grapples a guy that has been doing this for a long time. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9132.92s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9136.92s)]

*  He's an incredible person. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9138.92s)]
*  He's incredible. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9140.8s)]
*  And the fact that he gambled on himself, he vacated the UFC heavyweight title, which is [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9141.8s)]
*  the most prestigious title in all of combat sports. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9146.76s)]

*  And John Jones, unfortunately, just tore his fucking peck off the bone. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9169.44s)]
*  That video is heartbreaking. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9173.560000000001s)]

*  Horrible to see because I was really looking for that fight with Steve Bay. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9176.36s)]
*  But in a perfect world, Francis makes a fucking kajillion dollars and then the UFC resigns [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9178.720000000001s)]

*  That's a perfect world. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9190.92s)]
*  But at least Francis, he got his flowers from the whole world. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9192.72s)]
*  The whole world saw it. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9197.92s)]

*  And what happened in that fight was Francis Ngannou beat the best heavyweight boxer maybe [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9209.72s)]
*  ever. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9215.0s)]

*  Right. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9217.44s)]

*  I mean, what happens? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9221.720000000001s)]
*  That motherfucker hits so hard. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9223.84s)]
*  And I was always wondering, how is his power with the big gloves on? [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9226.44s)]
*  Well, we fucking know. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9230.52s)]
*  The look on Tyson Fury's eyes when he went down in the third round from that left hook, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9232.84s)]
*  he was like, oh Jesus. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9237.36s)]
*  It was a weird, it was a clubbing. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9238.36s)]
*  There was not a lot of ass behind it. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9241.76s)]
*  He hadn't stepped into it. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9243.28s)]
*  He didn't turn his shoulder over. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9244.28s)]
*  He just hit him with the hook. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9245.4s)]
*  And it put him all the way to Queer Street. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9246.96s)]
*  Yeah, he was on Queer Street for sure. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9249.48s)]
*  And you know, there was a moment in the second round that I yelled out. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9251.32s)]
*  I was like, oh, he heard him there. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9254.64s)]
*  In the second round, there was a moment in the clinch where he hit Tyson Fury with an [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9257.72s)]
*  uppercut. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9261.679999999998s)]
*  But then the commentators didn't even notice it. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9262.759999999998s)]
*  He hit him with the right hand over the top. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9264.119999999999s)]
*  And the right hand was a short clubbing right hand. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9266.24s)]
*  You see the look in Tyson Fury's eyes where he's like, Jesus. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9268.8s)]
*  That power is fucking extraordinary. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9272.519999999999s)]
*  But not just the power, but the intelligence to deliver that power in the most high pressure [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9275.06s)]
*  situation imaginable. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9280.98s)]
*  Your first boxing match is against the Gypsy King, a six foot nine fucking phenom who's [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9283.16s)]
*  one of the best boxers to ever do it. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9290.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9294.66s)]

*  Amazing. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9296.66s)]
*  And he just fucking cashed his own check. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9297.66s)]
*  I mean, he is the man now. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9300.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's in demand everywhere. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9302.14s)]
*  Everybody saw that fight. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9304.58s)]
*  It was a huge fight. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9305.58s)]
*  And now they're talking about him fighting Deontay Wilder. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9307.039999999999s)]
*  They're talking about him fighting some other people. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9309.3s)]
*  Anthony Joshua stepped up. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9311.02s)]
*  I love pugilistic sports. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9314.5s)]
*  As crazy as this world has been, wrestling, boxing, and MMA, and jiu-jitsu has been so [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9318.5s)]
*  fun from this last ADCC to UFC, the past five, six, not the most recent card, but three [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9324.26s)]
*  or four of them this year. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9332.72s)]
*  I've just been dynamite, tons of finishes, watching Shawn Strickland, his rise, and beating [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9333.72s)]
*  what I thought stylistically to be a very hard matchup. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9342.119999999999s)]
*  So God, I love martial arts. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9345.599999999999s)]
*  Another thing that I wish every single American would pour themselves into because the reward [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9349.359999999999s)]
*  that you get from it is... [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9355.24s)]
*  Well everybody wants to talk about the bullying crisis, but the counterintuitive solution [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9357.119999999999s)]
*  to the bullying crisis is teach bullies how to fight. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9361.16s)]
*  Teach everyone how to fight. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9364.84s)]
*  And guess what? [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9365.84s)]
*  Not just the victims. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9366.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9367.84s)]
*  You take... [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9368.84s)]
*  Man, I want every bully to come into my jiu-jitsu school. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9369.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9371.8s)]
*  Because they won't be bullies anymore. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9372.8s)]
*  They won't. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9373.8s)]
*  And what it is is a deep insecurity and this desire to impose yourself on other people [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9374.8s)]
*  to somehow or another make yourself feel better because you are lacking. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9382.0s)]
*  And if you are not lacking, you don't want to do that. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9385.32s)]
*  Do you think Francis Ngannou is a bully? [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9388.6s)]
*  He's not. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9390.84s)]
*  He's a very nice guy. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9391.84s)]
*  All the most savage dudes on the planet. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9392.84s)]
*  The nicest guys. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9394.32s)]
*  The nicest, sweetest, graceful people. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9395.32s)]
*  And like another Jordan Peterson philosophical perspective on a good man isn't a useless [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9398.28s)]
*  man. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9405.2s)]
*  A good man is a man that is capable of violence but chooses to be kind, chooses to be graceful. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9406.2s)]
*  And I 100% agree and subscribe to that. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9409.68s)]
*  Be a monster and learn how to control it. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9411.48s)]
*  Just an absolute... [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9413.48s)]
*  My mom hates this word savage. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9415.28s)]
*  A savage under control is somebody like that. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9417.28s)]
*  Would you rather be the gardener in the war or the warrior in the garden? [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9421.0s)]

*  But don't... [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9431.44s)]
*  Call a spade a spade. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9432.44s)]

*  me or towards mine. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9445.12s)]
*  But inversely, my kids will never have ever understand the level of violence that I'm [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9446.84s)]
*  capable of to be as kind and as gentle as I am to them. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_5EL89vzlU&t=9453.519999999999s)]
