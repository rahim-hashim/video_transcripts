# JRE MMA Show #153 with Joe Pyfer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6.4s)]
*  What's up Joe? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=13.76s)]
*  What's up Joe? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=14.76s)]
*  So we should say right away off the bat, because people don't know, you really did break Francis [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=15.76s)]
*  and Gano's punch record. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=21.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know what the confusion is, you know, I didn't want to... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  A lot of people, they doubt it just because he's so big. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=27.36s)]
*  So I'm going to post it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Well we just sent it to Jamie. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  You sent one where you broke, you went to 170. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=34.12s)]
*  Yeah 170. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=38.72s)]
*  So you got Eddie Hall. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=39.72s)]
*  He got 113. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=42.72s)]
*  And Francis had gotten 129. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=47.8s)]
*  We're trying to break Gano's record right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=50.8s)]
*  I had already hit four times. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=53.0s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=57.24s)]
*  170. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=58.24s)]
*  Now the only thing that, so this is the thing that people don't understand though, it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=59.24s)]
*  the same machine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  I think everybody thought it was like one of those punching bags that are down at the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=67.16s)]
*  woodwalk. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's aggravating because I pride myself in my power. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to hurt you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=77.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=78.36s)]
*  Like that's my intention. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=79.36s)]
*  I'm trying to, I mean we all throw with power right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=80.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=82.44s)]
*  I have a little different intentions sometimes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=83.48s)]
*  So you know, I've always prided myself in hitting hard. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=85.32s)]
*  I've always felt like I hit harder than everybody. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=87.84s)]
*  Now sure, I'm sure Francis' punch feels different than mine, but I got speed, I got power, and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=90.8s)]
*  I walk at like 220 when I'm at a camp. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=95.96s)]
*  So I'm not a small guy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=98.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=101.52s)]
*  I'm 6'2", 220 when I'm hitting that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=102.52s)]
*  And even then, probably there, I was probably late because I was injured. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=104.22s)]
*  So I was probably about 2'12", 2'14 when I hit that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=107.6s)]
*  And just to put it up, I'm going to post it whenever I get back home. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=111.04s)]
*  And I'm going to post a video and I'm going to post a picture also of me hitting higher [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  than that at 181. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=119.72s)]
*  I only have the picture, but Tuco's, Brendan Allen's coach was there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=120.72s)]
*  I think someone has kicked it up to like 187. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=125.4s)]
*  I think that's the newest high kick, which is crazy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=129.04s)]
*  Kick yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=133.36s)]
*  Yeah, your punch is that close to a kick. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=134.36s)]
*  That's pretty nuts. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=137.44s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=138.44s)]
*  It's a standstill object, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=139.44s)]
*  I can smash that thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=141.12s)]
*  I got my man. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=142.6s)]
*  But I've been... [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=143.6s)]
*  I was trying to see who did it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=144.6s)]
*  Here's Al Joke and Wonderboy kicking it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=147.6s)]
*  Someone just did 189. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=150.2s)]
*  I don't know who that is. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=151.2s)]
*  Lorenz Larkin. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=153.4s)]
*  That's Lorenz Larkin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=154.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's got the record now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=155.52s)]
*  Lorenz who used to fight in the UFC now, I guess he's with the PFL now, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=157.36s)]
*  I thought he was Bellator. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=162.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, they married. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=163.2s)]
*  Well, Bellator is the PFL now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=164.2s)]
*  Yeah, but Lorenz got 189. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=165.52s)]
*  Oh Jesus, he got 235? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=168.0s)]
*  Lorenz can fucking kick hard. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=170.76s)]
*  That's a super underrated dude. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=173.12s)]
*  I always go to his fight with Neil Magni. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=175.04s)]
*  Go watch that fight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=178.24s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=179.24s)]
*  I would love to see Diego Lima. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=180.24s)]
*  That dude can strike. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=181.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's another one. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=182.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=184.04s)]
*  Jose. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=185.04s)]
*  There's probably quite a few guys that can kick like that, but Lorenz, if you watch him, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=186.04s)]
*  that technique is just perfect. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=190.6s)]
*  He's perfect. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=193.08s)]
*  switches his hips. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=194.56s)]
*  The way he turns his body into it is just maximizing it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=195.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really, I mean, some people, it's weird, you know, for me because a lot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=198.96s)]
*  of people think I have natural power and I get annoyed with it because I've, I've never [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=204.36s)]
*  had anything natural in my life. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=208.44s)]
*  You know, everything was difficult learning it, learning jujitsu, learning how to box, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=210.28s)]
*  you know, everything was hard for me to learn. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=213.96s)]
*  So I have a bitter chip on my shoulder when people are like trying to discredit it with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  natural power. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=219.72000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=220.96s)]
*  There is a thing though, where there's a, there's like, you could unlock horsepower in a human [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=221.96s)]
*  being, but you only have so much when it comes to power. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=227.88s)]
*  There's certain people and I think you've all, we've all seen them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=232.12s)]
*  They just don't hit hard for whatever reason and they look big. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=234.48s)]
*  They can look strong. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=238.68s)]
*  And then there's certain guys that for whatever reason, they fucking hit crazy hard and they're [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=240.02s)]
*  not that big. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=244.72s)]
*  A lot of it is efficiency and fluidity and the technique and the leverage and that's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=246.16s)]
*  all learned, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=251.48s)]
*  But there's like a certain thing to like bone structure and just natural power. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  My bones gotta be trashed, Joe, cause I've fucking having two surgeries and I just think [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=260.4s)]
*  it's the amount of power that you generate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's probably a lot of it too. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=267.44s)]
*  It's probably a corny thing to say, but I was told that I almost generate too much force [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=269.4s)]
*  for my bone density to handle. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know how true that is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=276.52s)]
*  I don't know if they were just kind of stroking my ego, but it makes sense. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=277.88s)]
*  That's why your hands break when people's hands break. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=280.96s)]
*  That's why they break. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  Cause you're literally generating too much force for your bone structure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  When you fought Razak Alhassan, you are on, there's like, there's a thing that happens [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  with fighters where you see them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  You see anxiety, you see first fight, you see nerves, you see jitters. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=299.08s)]
*  You see skills, but it's hard to like see the full range of them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=303.8s)]
*  And then they start getting comfortable. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=308.0s)]
*  And when they start getting comfortable, like the mere short fight, you just stomped him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=310.16s)]
*  But the Razak Alhassan fight, like, dude, you are on another level. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=315.14s)]
*  Like that's like when, when people talk about a guy in the gym, like, dude, you got to see [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=319.72s)]
*  this motherfucker in the gym. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=324.04s)]
*  And then seeing that manifest itself inside the octagon. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=325.88s)]
*  To me, that's one of my favorite things to see. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=330.6s)]
*  I love watching guys show their potential, you know, and in that fight, Razak Alhassan [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=333.4s)]
*  is a beast. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=338.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's a dog. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=339.76s)]
*  He's a dangerous dude. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=340.76s)]
*  And you just put on a fucking show in that fight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=342.64s)]
*  You looked like you were on a completely different level. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=344.96s)]
*  Like you had gone up several rungs from where you were before. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=347.88s)]
*  You know what's crazy about it though, that the whole process of what's gotten me to that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=351.52s)]
*  point has been nothing shy of just, man, if I'm mentally happy, I'm going to destroy everybody. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  But I often struggle mentally, you know, like I, bro, I didn't turn it on. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=364.08s)]
*  My coaches were all scared in the back just because they know me so well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=369.0s)]
*  I'm an emotional dude. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  I wear my heart on my sleeve. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Like I say how I feel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=374.76s)]
*  You don't really have to read the room. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=376.92s)]
*  You can read my face. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=378.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=379.16s)]
*  You understand where I'm at. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=380.16s)]
*  And I'm not, I'm not shy to say where I'm at. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=381.16s)]
*  So that whole week was off. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=382.88s)]
*  Sean was in the corner. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  He got sick. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=386.36s)]
*  I had some issues with a, with a best friend and I've known for 12, 13 years, he didn't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=387.36s)]
*  get to come out and just everything was like off. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=391.48s)]
*  I had, I had MRSA on my bicep or my forearm two weeks before. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=394.44s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  I was on antibiotics before that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  I got in, I split my toes open where they separated. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  So the bone, so I like, I could barely like, I got all swollen, bro. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  I've never had an easy camp and I was, I was having nightmares for the first time of getting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=408.36s)]
*  knocked the fuck out like all week during my weight cut, during training. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=413.8s)]
*  I had these crazy nerves. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  I would get cold sweats. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=419.0s)]
*  I thought something was wrong and I'd never had that before, you know, and I was contemplating [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=420.52s)]
*  like, man, I'm not going to rush my career. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=426.2s)]
*  Maybe this isn't the right move, but uh, was it the step up in competition? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=428.6s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=433.4s)]
*  So this is crazy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=434.4s)]
*  He's going to come on. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=435.4s)]
*  It's not crazy, but it comes off as really arrogant. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=436.4s)]
*  Like Abdul was not a step up in competition for me. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=439.04s)]
*  He was a step up as far as, you know, power, you know, and people that I fought, uh, as [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=441.84s)]
*  far as, you know, people that have the ability to knock you out. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=447.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=450.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=451.44000000000005s)]
*  There's consequences for small error. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=452.44000000000005s)]
*  And, uh, but I knew skill for skill dudes not on my level. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  I knew Gerald Mershart, Mershart, however you say it, whenever I, bro, I mean that dude [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  to me without being disrespectful is, I don't know how he's been in the UFC. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=462.8s)]
*  Um, the guy I first fought, you know, he's not in the UFC anymore, but he had eight knockouts. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm not, I've been doing this for 23 years. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=470.88000000000005s)]
*  I started at four and a half years old. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  Um, I don't want people to think that I'm cocky or arrogant, but I am, I am cocky. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=474.6s)]
*  I'm confident, you know, don't you think you kind of have to be? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=479.04s)]
*  Yeah, you do have to fucking gauge fight. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=481.48s)]
*  It's your protection barrier too, from, from people to just openly try to cut you down. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=483.96s)]
*  Cause everybody like, like hitting that punching machine, everybody immediately discredits, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  uh, says that Dana White just wants to get after Francis and Ghana. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  That's why they didn't release the video. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=496.28s)]
*  I told you at the Austin fight, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=497.76s)]
*  I was pissed off. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=499.52s)]
*  It didn't get posted. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=500.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=501.52s)]
*  I mean, it's posted now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=502.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=503.52s)]
*  So, uh, it's posted now and you know, it's on a big platform, but yeah, man, I mean, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=504.52s)]
*  Dua was just somebody you had to be careful with, but I didn't think he boxed better than [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  me. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=512.12s)]
*  And I think DC even says as I'm walking into the cage and, uh, his best shot was to knock [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=513.12s)]
*  me out. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=517.28s)]
*  And if he couldn't knock me out, he wasn't winning that fight. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=518.28s)]
*  Well, it's also very evident, like you're one of those guys that's at the top of the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  185 pound division in terms of like physical stature. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=525.4s)]
*  You don't get much bigger at one 85. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=529.16s)]
*  It's like you and guys like Paheta, which Paheta doesn't even make sense. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=531.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=534.44s)]
*  Like how? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  How the fuck are you 185? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=536.5200000000001s)]
*  Man, even when I look at it, yeah, I mean, when I look at him, like I've seen, it's so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=537.5200000000001s)]
*  weird. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  We've seen each other so many times. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  There's no head nod, there's no respect. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=543.5200000000001s)]
*  There's no like, uh, even him, like, man, I think a lot of guys are overrated in this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=544.5200000000001s)]
*  fucking sport. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=549.6400000000001s)]
*  You think that guy's overrated? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=550.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't think his, I think, I think getting hit by him isn't overrated, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=551.6400000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  But he's very stiff and he's got that off switch. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  He's got that off switch. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=559.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, he definitely does at 85. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=560.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=562.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=563.7600000000001s)]
*  I don't know about 205. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=565.08s)]
*  I think that is a big part of the weight cut. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=566.08s)]
*  I think his weight cut is borderline dangerous. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=568.76s)]
*  Like I think that a weight cut to 85 could kill you. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=573.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=576.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=577.72s)]
*  I think he's just so tough that he doesn't. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=578.72s)]
*  But I think there's, there's a point of diminishing returns and certainly with your chin. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=580.34s)]
*  And when Izzy cracked him, obviously Izzy hit him perfect. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=585.24s)]
*  It was pinpoint and then rocked him with the second shot. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=588.16s)]
*  But the way he went out, I was like, it's gone. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=591.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=593.6s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to say any names, but you know, there, there's a guy that just [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=595.44s)]
*  recently lost who I like. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's like, man, like when you've had that off button shut off to the point where you're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=600.4s)]
*  frozen and it's not like you got TKO'd, it's off. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=604.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=606.84s)]
*  There's a thing that happens to guys when they've taken too many shots. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=607.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=610.6s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=611.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=612.6s)]
*  I've never, I've never been laid out. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=613.6s)]
*  Last time I was ever dropped, I was 18 years old. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=614.6s)]
*  I got dropped by a guy that used to be in the UFC for a brief moment. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=616.52s)]
*  It was Tim Williams. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=619.36s)]
*  He fought your boy, Eric Anders. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  I like, he's cool. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=623.6s)]
*  But, but yeah, no, I've never been, I've never had the lights like shut off or anything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=624.6s)]
*  So thankful for that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=628.2s)]
*  But I pride myself on my defense too. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=629.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=631.84s)]
*  I don't. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=632.84s)]
*  It's critical. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=633.84s)]
*  I mean, a strong defensive base is so important when you know how to move well. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=634.84s)]
*  I was just watching this documentary that the UFC put on about Anderson Silva. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=638.88s)]
*  It's not that I forgot how good Anderson Silva was. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=644.84s)]
*  Smooth. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  Super smooth. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=649.1600000000001s)]
*  Super fluent. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  Everything, man. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  When he was in his prime, his fucking defense too was so perfect. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  He was so hard to hit clean. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  His range, man. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=658.16s)]
*  You know, when you're taller, these guys underestimate range and, and you know, everybody wants to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=659.16s)]
*  brawl, but people don't understand range. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=662.92s)]
*  You know, you should be able to slide back and it just grazes your beard, you know, like, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=664.76s)]
*  so. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=668.76s)]
*  Range is everything. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=669.76s)]
*  And also the mechanical advantage of that long frame, when Anderson would throw that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=670.76s)]
*  torque on guys, you know, when he was in his prime, like you watch like the Rich Franklin [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  fights and the Chris Liebman fight and like that fucking dude was special, man. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=680.92s)]
*  But so now let me ask you, because I'm a huge fan of the old school days more so than the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=685.64s)]
*  new school. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=691.52s)]
*  I just think it was more raw and just like, like I liked when everybody was on Royds. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=692.52s)]
*  You know, everybody was on Royds, but that's exactly the stipulation, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=697.52s)]
*  You know, we're so hard on the athletes of today. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=702.96s)]
*  They pop for something that's not even a performance, performance enhancing level. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=704.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=708.8s)]
*  They've always had their reign and were never discredited, but we know they were all on [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  shit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=713.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=714.52s)]
*  Well, I always talk about TRT Vitor, you know, I think TRT Vitor, the Vitor that fucked up [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=715.52s)]
*  Luke Rockhold and Michael Bisping, that dude, I put him up against anybody ever. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=719.3599999999999s)]
*  He was fucking terrifying, but he was also like silverback gorilla levels of testosterone. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=723.8s)]
*  He was like off the charts when they tested him. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=730.4s)]
*  One of the reasons why they stopped TRT is because they tested Vitor one time and he [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=734.04s)]
*  was so far off the charts. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=738.48s)]
*  They were like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=740.52s)]
*  And he had said that, you know, he was going to be in America for like a week. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=743.64s)]
*  And so the doctor just gave him a big dose to like last for the week. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=746.72s)]
*  I just think he looks, oh man. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=751.12s)]
*  Well, Yoel Romero, Yoel Romero is the freak of all freaks. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=755.32s)]
*  And I've said this many times before on this podcast, but he is the single most impressive [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  athlete I've ever seen in all my years of watching fights. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=765.32s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=768.88s)]
*  44 now? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=769.88s)]
*  He's at least 44. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=770.88s)]
*  He might be 45, 46. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=771.88s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=772.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=773.88s)]
*  Juice, Juice Vitor was, was the bond. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=774.88s)]
*  Yoel didn't even need juice, man. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=775.88s)]
*  He was a part of the Cuban athletic program. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=777.94s)]
*  And there's something about that dude, whether it's genetics or who knows what it is, but [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=781.12s)]
*  I've told this before, so I apologize for anybody's heard this. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=784.5200000000001s)]
*  The UFC had brought him to a doctor after one of his fights. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  I think it was one of his fights in Australia. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=791.08s)]
*  The doctor said to the UFC, where did you get this guy? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=794.04s)]
*  And he goes, and they were like, he's one of our fighters. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  He said, I've never seen anything like him. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=801.16s)]
*  He goes, yeah, he's pretty amazing, right? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  He goes, no, you don't understand. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=804.0s)]
*  I've never seen a human being like him. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=805.4799999999999s)]
*  The tendons in his eyes are three times larger than normal. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=808.4799999999999s)]
*  They said that his, his orbital bone, when it fractured, by the time they got him to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=813.0s)]
*  the doctor, like a couple of days later, it already started healing. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=817.16s)]
*  Like this guy's a fucking Wolverine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=820.4799999999999s)]
*  He was eating fucking bark or something for growing up. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=822.24s)]
*  I mean, he was something super special. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=825.32s)]
*  I have to say, he was, he was someone that I loved watching. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  I loved that Paul Acosta and your Romero fight and whatnot. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  I was always sad and I never got to see him win a belt before he left. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=836.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, he was in the UFC, like he started in the UFC, I believe in his very late thirties. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like 37. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=845.84s)]
*  Yeah, something crazy like that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=847.0s)]
*  Like when he knocked out Liotta Machida, I think he was like 38, 39. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=848.48s)]
*  He was already at the range where most guys are looking to hang it up. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=852.6s)]
*  But look at a guy like that, right? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=855.8800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he's that technical. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=857.2s)]
*  I don't think he's- [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=859.7600000000001s)]
*  Was wrestling, certainly is. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=860.9200000000001s)]
*  Very technically, yeah, wrestling 100%, you know? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  But he never used it as like a complete mixed martial artist. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=863.96s)]
*  He always seemed to kind of just be like the kickboxing guy, wanted to keep it on [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=869.48s)]
*  the feet every now and then. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=872.32s)]
*  Which is crazy when you think about his wrestling background. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=873.6400000000001s)]
*  But that's just an energy thing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=876.08s)]
*  The amount of energy that it takes to wrestle. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=878.12s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=880.2s)]
*  To take guys down a lot, especially when they're slippery, especially when he's not a submission guy. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=880.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=885.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he has any submissions in his record. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=888.96s)]
*  He just smashes guys when he gets them on the ground. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=889.48s)]
*  But his wrestling was so elite, but yet you rarely saw it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=891.64s)]
*  But like when he knocked out Chris Weidman with that flying knee, like that fucking dude [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  could explode on you like no other. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  Man, yeah, it's that, he's, yeah, I mean, that's a guy that's natural though, right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=903.0s)]
*  You want to say as a natural athlete, like that's how he was born into it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=907.32s)]
*  I think maybe there was something going on in Cuba. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  I think they were doing some, look, look at Karelin. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=913.7600000000001s)]
*  We always talk about Karelin, but Karelin for the Soviet Union, they called him the experiment. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=916.4000000000001s)]
*  That's literally what they called him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=921.2s)]
*  He was so freakish and his parents were like normal size. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=923.12s)]
*  They were like, they were small folks. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=926.84s)]
*  And he would like be walking with his parents, like with his hands on their shoulders. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  He was a giant. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=931.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=932.72s)]
*  Just a immense human being. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=933.08s)]
*  Here's a bowl of cereal and here's some fucking testosterone. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=935.24s)]
*  There was no bowl of cereal. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=938.08s)]
*  They gave him a fucking caribou liver for breakfast. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=939.0s)]
*  That guy was, he was a freak of all freaks. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=941.68s)]
*  But I think there's something to that Soviet training program. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=944.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at other communist countries, like particularly Cuba, there's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=948.0s)]
*  no doubt about it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  They did whatever they could to make their athletes the best they could. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  And it just stands to a certain extent. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=955.6s)]
*  I mean, I think if you want to, you want to have that peak performance, you want to have [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=958.08s)]
*  that peak human being from whatever you're trying to, you know, put them in. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=961.36s)]
*  I mean, you can't naturally. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=964.48s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=966.72s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's very hard. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=967.2s)]
*  It's the hardest. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=968.9200000000001s)]
*  You get lucky. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  You get lucky and get a Francis in Ghana with like the best genetics ever. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=970.28s)]
*  Or you can just start manipulating someone when they're very young. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=973.72s)]
*  If you get a young kid and you start giving them growth hormone and IGF one and all [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=977.84s)]
*  peptides and stuff when they're really little, like you can get it depends on their [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  diet. Right. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=986.4s)]
*  I mean, like most of everything we use processed and trash to that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=987.04s)]
*  We are sure to give them optimal nutrition. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=991.72s)]
*  I'm sure that they I'm sure with that kind of a program like a communist program [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=994.4s)]
*  with where everything is on the line. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=999.56s)]
*  Like if you are a athlete for a totalitarian dictatorship, like whether it's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  Cuba or Russia or China or whatever it is, they will do whatever they can to make [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1010.56s)]
*  their athletes the best. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1015.76s)]
*  Like the idea of cheating. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1017.4399999999999s)]
*  We saw the Sochi Olympics with that documentary, Icarus. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1018.96s)]
*  Have you seen that documentary? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1021.6s)]
*  It's a great documentary by Brian Fogle about I've talked about this recently. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1023.24s)]
*  I apologize to people who listen, but the Brian Fogle, what he was going to do is he [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  did a bike race and he did a bike race natural and he's a very good athlete, endurance [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1033.88s)]
*  athlete. So he did this bike race natural. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1039.96s)]
*  And then he went to this guy who is the head of the Soviet anti-doping program. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1042.32s)]
*  And he said, this is what I want to do. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1046.56s)]
*  I want to do it natural one year. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1048.64s)]
*  And then the next year, I want you to just juice me up to the tits and we're going to [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  do a documentary and see how I do juiced versus natural. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1053.84s)]
*  In the process of filming all this, it got released that the Sochi Olympics were [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1058.2399999999998s)]
*  rigged. And so what Russia was doing was they put a hole in the wall where the urine [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  samples were and they were swapping urine samples. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1070.8s)]
*  So they're taking the dirty urine samples from there because it was in Russia. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1074.08s)]
*  So they're taking the dirty urine samples from their athletes and swapping it out for [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1077.16s)]
*  clean urine samples. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1080.64s)]
*  But they got caught because they found these micro scratches on these jars that were [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1082.32s)]
*  supposedly impossible to open and that these impenetrable jars, they stored the urine [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1087.72s)]
*  in to make it secure. But then they did an analysis in the jar and they said, somebody's [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1093.4s)]
*  been fucking with these jars. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  And so then they analyzed the urine and then the whole house of cards came tumbling down [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1098.72s)]
*  while this guy was doing this documentary. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1102.72s)]
*  And this guy, what was his name? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  Gregory Richenko. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1106.8s)]
*  Is that his name? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1108.52s)]
*  Richenko. That gentleman who is the head of the Soviet doping program got in the witness [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1110.16s)]
*  protection program and then spilled the beans on the Soviet Union. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1115.4s)]
*  He's hiding in America now. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1118.56s)]
*  I mean, they arrested his family. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  They took away his family's money like they they fucked his whole family up. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1121.64s)]
*  Like it's the whole the story is crazy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1125.92s)]
*  But he detailed everything that they do as far as their doping program. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1128.4s)]
*  And they doped everybody. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1132.68s)]
*  They doped everybody except figure skaters. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1134.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the dude. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1137.44s)]
*  Gregory Richenko. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1138.96s)]
*  Definitely not what I was imaging or picturing in my head. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1139.96s)]
*  He's hilarious. He's actually funny. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1143.24s)]
*  But it's an amazing documentary. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1144.76s)]
*  I can't recommend Icarus enough, but it just shows how far these countries are willing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1147.2s)]
*  to go in order to gain national superiority by having their athletes gold [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1152.1999999999998s)]
*  medal more than anybody. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1158.4799999999998s)]
*  Power. It's the most addicting thing, right? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1159.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it's also it's national pride. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1161.76s)]
*  There's a lot. And they're all assuming that everybody else is doing this, too, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  because everybody on some shit. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1169.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like everybody's on for sure. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1171.1599999999999s)]
*  If they can get away with it, they cheat. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1173.76s)]
*  Pete, there's so much, especially when it comes to things like the Olympics, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1175.28s)]
*  because I'll never stop exploring, trying to find the easier route. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1178.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, exactly. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1181.2s)]
*  It's funny because a lot of people have said shit to me. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1182.88s)]
*  And I'm like, listen, when I came back after I broke my arm, I was big before I [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1186.4s)]
*  broke my arm. And then but I was big in the wrong way. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  I was big in like a weightlifting way. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1194.48s)]
*  When did you bring on? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1196.72s)]
*  Twenty twenty maybe. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1201.0s)]
*  And how did you do it? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1202.2s)]
*  Dustin Stoltz first. I got Matt returned in a fucking contender series fight, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  dislocated, broke backwards. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1207.16s)]
*  And that's your right arm. That's my right arm. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1209.04s)]
*  So I had one surgery. That's this scar. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1210.6399999999999s)]
*  Six months later, I joined my team, Marquez, where Sean's at and all the Philly [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1213.2s)]
*  guys. And then I had six months again, had to get another surgery and another major [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1217.9199999999998s)]
*  surgery and same injury. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1222.2s)]
*  Just re-injured. So no. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  So I still had a torn forearm and I still I had a whole bunch of bone growth behind. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1225.32s)]
*  So I broke the radial head in half, which is what you rotate. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1229.2s)]
*  So I can rotate my hand right like this on my good arm. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  But I can't go any further than this because it's pinned to the screw. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1234.72s)]
*  So it's dead. Yeah. Oh, wow. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1238.48s)]
*  And that's as straight as my arm goes. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1239.88s)]
*  So. Oh, wow. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1241.68s)]
*  Yeah. So motherfuckers don't understand that this was I was given a 30 percent chance [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1242.76s)]
*  of being able to fight, you know, if I got the second surgery. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1247.48s)]
*  Thirty percent. Thirty percent because of the nerve damage and not like having full [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1251.0400000000002s)]
*  functionality because there's a lot of nerves in there, especially where I got surgery [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  and how much damage and inflammation and whatnot was in there. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1258.8000000000002s)]
*  So they had to cut the capsule and whatnot. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1262.8400000000001s)]
*  So, man, when I tell you like I'm going to be hurting when I'm older, I'm going to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1264.72s)]
*  be hurting. I have pain every day and whatnot. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1268.12s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean, I broke my arm in some bullshit fluke accident. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I did get my return. I should have let go of the head. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1276.04s)]
*  I was going to go for a guillotine. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1278.0s)]
*  And then he lifted me. I didn't expect it. Right. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1279.6799999999998s)]
*  Posted out. Boom. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1281.6s)]
*  Been that way a thousand times in practice. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1283.36s)]
*  Never been hurt. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1285.2399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Ate me up, man. Ate me up. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1287.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, they closed the ambulance doors and you don't get to say shit to Dana [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1289.6399999999999s)]
*  White. And all you get is a bunch of nerds that text you and say, hey, man, at least [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1292.8s)]
*  you got a couple of million views. You're famous. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I lost sponsorships. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1299.84s)]
*  I was depressed, suicidal, all that shit. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1301.6s)]
*  And 20 years of my life, I think, at that point. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1303.6s)]
*  So you were really concerned that that was the end. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1307.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, you know, I started this at four and a half years old. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1309.04s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't know how much you know, but, you know, I started this [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1311.6399999999999s)]
*  at four and a half years old and I haven't seen another path. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1315.48s)]
*  And this was my A and there was no B. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1317.96s)]
*  So if they didn't work, that was it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1320.04s)]
*  So at four and a half, you knew you wanted to fight eight years old. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  I knew I went to fight four and a half. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1325.36s)]
*  I started jujitsu five years old. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1326.72s)]
*  I did my first competition in Naga. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1328.24s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, eight years old, I started developing like a little bit of a confidence. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1331.24s)]
*  I was so run down and abused that that was where my my confidence started coming from. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1336.28s)]
*  So I never had a dream of the belt. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1341.72s)]
*  And I can say all these years, I've never had a dream of holding a belt, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  but I always had a dream of people chanting my name when I was walking out to a sold out crowd. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1346.28s)]
*  So that was always my dream. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1350.04s)]
*  And I always I've always wanted that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1351.8s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I was I wasn't a kid that hung out with kids. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1354.2s)]
*  You know, I was homeschooled and. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot there's a lot of detail to uncover in there. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1360.84s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean, I've known I wanted to do this all my life. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1363.84s)]
*  And when I tell you there was no plan B, bro, there was no plan B. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1367.04s)]
*  When did you have your first MMA fight? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1370.8s)]
*  How old were you? I was I think 20 years old, 20 years old. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1372.68s)]
*  Yeah, 20 years old. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1376.84s)]
*  Actually, no, that's not true. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1378.28s)]
*  Yeah, it is true. 20 years old. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1379.76s)]
*  I think it was 2017 was my first fight [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1381.36s)]
*  or 2016, one of those years and amateur or. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1385.96s)]
*  So P.A. P.A. boy at the time. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  You have to have five amateurs for you could go pro. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1392.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1394.56s)]
*  The interesting that was the rule when I was fighting. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  So you had to have a rule. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1397.76s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think it is. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1399.56s)]
*  You definitely have to have amateur experience to be considered [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1401.36s)]
*  to get your pro license. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1403.76s)]
*  What if you're like an amateur wrestler or something like that? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1404.72s)]
*  Does that translate into I don't think so. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1407.48s)]
*  I think it's just that I think it's just the way that the P.A. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1409.44s)]
*  commission was with Greg Serb back then. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1412.0400000000002s)]
*  It's not a bad idea. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1414.0s)]
*  So I went for one as an amateur [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1415.4s)]
*  and I felt so held back with the bullshit shin guards [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1417.68s)]
*  not being able to punch somebody in the face. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's how it is with the amateurs. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1422.64s)]
*  You can't punch the face. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1423.88s)]
*  Can't punch in the face. No elbowing on the face. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1424.64s)]
*  No. So I couldn't wait to turn pro, man. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  I felt so held back and my kind of training. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1429.0800000000002s)]
*  Like I trained at Fight Factory, which was a gym that had Eddie Alvarez [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1432.3600000000001s)]
*  when he was 19 years old. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1435.52s)]
*  I met Eddie before he even had his first fight. Oh, wow. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  So when I say I know a lot of these guys will say, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  oh, I know these people. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1441.72s)]
*  I'm I'm the OG in the gym as the young guy [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1442.8000000000002s)]
*  because I've been around for so long. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1447.16s)]
*  So that's why when these these fucking clickbait turds come out [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  and they say, oh, you know, he's fighting a guy with a lot of experience. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1452.64s)]
*  And Gerald Mearshaar, he's got the most submission. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1455.92s)]
*  And when motherfucker, you're not doing anything that I have never seen. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1457.8400000000001s)]
*  Now, there's a difference between watching on the TV and saying, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1461.7600000000002s)]
*  he doesn't do anything special. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1465.5600000000002s)]
*  And you get in there, you feel somebody's presence. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1466.68s)]
*  You feel that energy. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1468.92s)]
*  You feel their intention, you know. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1470.0800000000002s)]
*  So I knew that motherfucker wasn't going to bang with me. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1471.64s)]
*  I knew Abdul wasn't going to bang with me. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  That's why as soon as I cracked on me and soon as I let him feel me like, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  yeah, motherfucker, like, go ahead. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1479.16s)]
*  And, you know, he didn't get that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1480.8000000000002s)]
*  He didn't get to get going. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1483.24s)]
*  You know, I checked him immediately. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1484.7600000000002s)]
*  Like, you're a powerhouse. You're an alpha. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1486.4s)]
*  Well, so am I. Come take it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1488.0s)]
*  You know, so I fight with a heavy heart in there. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1489.5200000000002s)]
*  You mean you try and take my living from me. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm still poor kid. That's my mentality. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1494.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm nothing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1496.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'm trying to be something. You know what I mean? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1498.0s)]
*  So you better be ready to kill me, motherfuckers. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1499.6s)]
*  Like, that's how same thing with this guy, Jack, man. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1501.96s)]
*  Like, nice guy. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1504.16s)]
*  You better be ready to die in there. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1505.52s)]
*  I'm I'm coming for you. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1506.84s)]
*  Like, I don't want no decisions. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1508.52s)]
*  You talk about your abuse. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1510.2s)]
*  Like, what what exactly was the abuse? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1512.08s)]
*  I don't want to give the short version, right? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1515.16s)]
*  You know, this is a moment right now that I get to recognize that I'm in front of [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1516.72s)]
*  somebody who has you've heard so many stories, so many crazy things. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1520.4s)]
*  And, you know, my story is definitely not up there with the crazy things. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1523.4s)]
*  Right. But my story. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1526.44s)]
*  I'm unique. I'm one of one. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1527.88s)]
*  So my story is, you know, I started out. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1529.64s)]
*  The abuse started when I was a year old. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1534.0400000000002s)]
*  My parents both blame each other, you know, child services in and out of our lives. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1536.7600000000002s)]
*  I'm one of five kids. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  I got four sisters, two older, two younger. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1541.44s)]
*  And I started getting beat as a as a one year old from what I was told, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1543.8000000000002s)]
*  because I shit myself. Right. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1548.3600000000001s)]
*  It's what kids infants do. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1549.92s)]
*  And so that's when it started. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1551.88s)]
*  And you got beat for going to the bathroom. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1553.5600000000002s)]
*  Shit my diaper. Yeah. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1557.44s)]
*  The story is, I shit my diaper, reached in my diaper, wiped on the walls, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1559.6399999999999s)]
*  and then I got beat for it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1562.96s)]
*  Neither parent owns up to it, but both parents have blamed each other [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1564.72s)]
*  just because of the physical physical abuse on my father's side. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1569.12s)]
*  100 percent has to be him. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1573.0s)]
*  My mom was not physically aggressive by nature. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1575.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? She she definitely what my ass, you know, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1578.28s)]
*  a good amount, but it was never with the mean intentions, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1582.2s)]
*  you know, comparable to my father. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1585.4799999999998s)]
*  It was more verbal on her end. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1588.9599999999998s)]
*  But but yeah, so it started then. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1590.28s)]
*  And, bro, since the time I've had memory, I remember getting my head stomped, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1592.28s)]
*  getting beat, getting screamed at, slapped, humiliated, just run down, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1595.84s)]
*  told you you're never going to be anything. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1599.9199999999998s)]
*  And, you know, my sisters received, unfortunately, received the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1601.4399999999998s)]
*  the same treatment. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1605.28s)]
*  And yeah, so I mean, abuse has been something and toxic. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1607.12s)]
*  And I mean, toxic. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1610.76s)]
*  Like when I want to say, like breaking somebody down, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1611.76s)]
*  I didn't have an ounce of self-esteem. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1614.88s)]
*  I was my dad's puppy. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1616.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't know no life being homeschooled. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1617.6000000000001s)]
*  You do school, right? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  Is he still around? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1621.92s)]
*  Still living? Yeah, still living. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1623.64s)]
*  I'm not sure where I've parted ways with him. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1625.8400000000001s)]
*  And I don't want to talk to him. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1628.8s)]
*  Next time I see him is probably, you know, yeah, when it's done. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1630.72s)]
*  And I don't hate him. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1635.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? I don't hate him. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  But I despise him as a human being as far as, you know, what he's given back [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1639.48s)]
*  to the world and the kind of person that he's accepted to be. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1642.96s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, yeah, he's still around. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1647.08s)]
*  I just don't know where and I don't really care where. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1648.68s)]
*  So I know my mom still lives at the house that I grew up in. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1650.8s)]
*  And it's so hard to believe that some people are capable [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1654.32s)]
*  of becoming what they become, you know, and to do that to their child. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1658.0s)]
*  You know, what's fucked up about it the most is that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1663.48s)]
*  it was almost better for me to have never known him than to know him [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1667.28s)]
*  and see how it went and lose him. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1670.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? Because I love that man as a child. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1673.92s)]
*  That was my idol. Nobody could beat him in the gym. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1676.4s)]
*  Like that was that's what I thought. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1678.6000000000001s)]
*  And I never thought he was a liar, you know, and then right around 15 years old. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1680.96s)]
*  And I definitely think I was behind, you know what I mean socially [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1684.24s)]
*  just because of being homeschooled. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1688.84s)]
*  So my dad wound up getting social security disability. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1690.2s)]
*  And he was a stay at home dad. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1692.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Collecting SSD and fucking doing nothing, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1695.16s)]
*  but beating his kids and screaming and sitting, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1698.1999999999998s)]
*  basically just being, you know, a child abuser to all of us. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  And never once has he ever taken accountability for the wrongs that he's done. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1705.32s)]
*  And if he's tried to finagle it, it's been to be like, hey, you were a bad kid. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1712.0s)]
*  It's like, yo, I want to know. I want to know how I was a bad kid. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  I didn't steal. Sure. I lied as a kid out of fear [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  because I was afraid to get my head stomped or get beat like a man. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1724.08s)]
*  You know, I didn't get I didn't get a traditional ass whooping job. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1727.04s)]
*  Like neither of my sisters either. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1730.12s)]
*  They got picked up by their necks, picked up by their hair, strangled. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1731.52s)]
*  You know, and there's there's many there's many stories, you know. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1735.8799999999999s)]
*  And as you know, we have a documentary, right? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1740.96s)]
*  And I refrain from putting the details of specific stories [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1743.76s)]
*  because the documentary is not about what was me for me. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1748.32s)]
*  It's about a I never through all of this. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1753.8799999999999s)]
*  Gave up on the dream to get to the UFC, even when I broke my arm [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1757.0s)]
*  and I thought I was doing I did everything right. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1760.72s)]
*  I didn't go out and party. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1763.16s)]
*  I didn't go out and do drugs and never I've never smoked weed. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1764.6000000000001s)]

*  I've never smoked a cigarette. I've never take popped a pill. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1770.76s)]
*  I've never done anything. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1773.68s)]
*  I didn't go out to strip clubs. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1776.0800000000002s)]
*  I didn't go out and bring girls home from the bar. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1777.76s)]
*  It's never been me. So. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1780.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was just always focused. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1782.76s)]
*  I was obsessed with this. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1785.24s)]
*  I was obsessed with this and I was obsessed with this [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1786.68s)]
*  because I knew if I couldn't do this, I would have checked out. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  And that's that's what made me, you know, that's what made me like, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1791.92s)]
*  keep going, motherfucker, keep going, keep going, keep going. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1795.0s)]
*  And I just kept beating down the door of people like my coach [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1797.5200000000002s)]
*  that, you know, has come with me. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1800.88s)]
*  I've known that man since I was 10 years old, you know, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1803.0s)]
*  and he's seen me where in the gym and nothing's changed. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  He could tell you that from, you know, the only thing that's changed [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1808.8000000000002s)]
*  is my maturity, the way I look at life perspective. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1811.2s)]
*  But yeah, man, I mean, it was a it was a rough background. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1814.2800000000002s)]
*  It only got worse as I got older. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1817.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a horrible thing to hear. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1819.76s)]
*  You know, as parents, it's terrifying to think that a parent, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1822.0s)]
*  another parent could do that to their child. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1825.3200000000002s)]
*  But we all know it's true. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1827.16s)]
*  And we all know that it can do one of two things to someone. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1828.68s)]
*  It could just ruin your life or it can give you this unstoppable fuel. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1831.64s)]
*  And that's what it seems to have done with you. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1836.92s)]
*  I would never wish that on anybody. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1839.16s)]
*  But I often see people like you that are so fucking driven [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1841.36s)]
*  and so angry in there and so effective because of that, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1845.08s)]
*  like so dangerous because I was often wonder, like, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1848.36s)]
*  is it even possible to make a guy like you without that? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1852.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1856.9599999999998s)]
*  I look at like Mike Tyson, same thing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1857.84s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  But I think that's where I have my appreciation for him. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1860.8s)]
*  You know, I'll never discredit him. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1863.84s)]
*  I would not be in the sport if it wasn't for him. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1866.4399999999998s)]
*  He was the one that went to the gym. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1868.6s)]
*  He's the one that introduced me and I will give respect where it's due. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1869.84s)]
*  Right. And that's the respect. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1872.4399999999998s)]
*  Was he a fighter? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1873.36s)]
*  So he grew up in Kensington, Philadelphia. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1874.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't know how well you know Philadelphia. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1876.9199999999998s)]
*  Shithole. Bad parents. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1878.36s)]
*  Mom apparently was, you know, borderline. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1880.72s)]
*  I don't know if she was a prostitute or whatever, but he was homeless from. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1883.04s)]
*  He was passed home to home. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1886.6799999999998s)]
*  He was always passed back and forth to his parents. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1888.0s)]
*  So he lived a much rougher life than me. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1889.8s)]
*  And, you know, he got jumped all the time. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1893.72s)]
*  Back then, it was, you know, a very segregated type, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1896.56s)]
*  you know, you don't come into this part of Philly and you don't cross this part of Philly. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1899.4s)]
*  And so he would get jumped all the time. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1903.2s)]
*  I think he was like a timid, like skinny, nerdy, male nutrition child growing up. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1904.68s)]
*  So I know his dad, my grand, my grandpop, who I've met a handful of times [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1910.08s)]
*  was in the Vietnam War. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1916.4s)]
*  But then when he came back, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1917.56s)]
*  apparently my dad's story is that he used to sell drugs all the time and was always high. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1918.44s)]
*  And like, like, that's that's the story he painted to us. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1923.0s)]
*  So in my eyes, like we never knew him, really. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1925.56s)]
*  Other than a handful of times, we met him because they were bad people and he despised them. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  And he he always held like the craziest anger towards his family. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1932.6s)]
*  Like they all blackballed him. He was the black sheep. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, he grew up rough, too. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1939.04s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, he he boxed, apparently for a long time. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1940.56s)]
*  You know, he used to tell everybody he was 115 and four. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1947.6s)]
*  You can't fucking find the guy's records anywhere. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  It's 100 percent bullshit. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1952.0s)]
*  Dude, it's a fucking storyteller. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1953.28s)]
*  But he could box, you know what I mean? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1954.48s)]
*  Even if he didn't fight, he could box. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1956.96s)]
*  He would do well against guys that were pro boxers or guys that were in the gym. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1958.44s)]
*  My dad was a tough dude. He was good. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1962.56s)]
*  But, you know, definitely always lied for his convenience, for his story. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1965.56s)]
*  And yeah, as he was learning jujitsu with a guy named Steve [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1970.48s)]
*  Hegg, who wound up owning Fight Factory, who taught me jujitsu alongside with my dad. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1974.48s)]
*  But that's how I got into it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1979.8s)]
*  So I owe him a thanks for the tools that he gave me for the house I have gone to build. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1981.04s)]
*  That's how I see it. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1986.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he ever intended to give me these tools and me going [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1988.0s)]
*  fucking build a house with it. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1991.36s)]
*  And I think he despises me for it. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the guys when I broke my arm, sends a message face down, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1994.6s)]
*  ass up, just how you like it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1997.84s)]
*  You'll never I told you. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=1999.44s)]
*  Bro, he said a lot of shit, man. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2001.2s)]
*  He said a lot of shit. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2003.08s)]
*  And don't get me wrong, I've said a lot of shit back. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2004.32s)]
*  Like we've we've argued, you know, and he brings that special rage [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2006.08s)]
*  where I would like lose my life or his life over it. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2009.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2012.0s)]
*  Like I have to separate myself from him. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2012.52s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2016.16s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, but yeah, there's no hold bar when it comes to that guy. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2017.0s)]
*  The way he manipulates, the way he lies, the way he has basically hurt every single person. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2021.24s)]
*  He has he has no true. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2026.92s)]
*  He has no long lasting friendships in his life. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2028.04s)]
*  There's a reason for that, you know. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2031.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's horrible. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2032.32s)]
*  Yeah. So not a good human being. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2033.76s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2035.4s)]
*  But again, I mean, I hate to say it, but in your line of work, it's like a superpower. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2036.4s)]
*  It is a superpower. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2041.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? I got I got that dark devil with me when I need him. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2042.64s)]
*  And I don't mind it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2045.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? I can be a sweetheart. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2047.0800000000002s)]
*  I could be a good person. I'm a giving person. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2048.8s)]
*  I give a lot back in the dark to my teammates. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2050.8s)]
*  You know, one of the kids is Jose Soto, who just, by the way, got surgery today. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  Hope you're doing well. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  I think he's going to like he's got one eye like visible, like visibility. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2060.12s)]
*  And he's one of the toughest guys I've ever sparred. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2065.12s)]
*  And he's an amateur. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2067.24s)]
*  How is it that I want to ask you about this? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2069.32s)]
*  Like, you know, Shara Bullitt, one. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2071.92s)]
*  That's why I'm saying it, because I'm telling you right now, this kid will whoop that dude. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2074.72s)]
*  How is Shara Bullitt able to fight? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2078.08s)]
*  I mean, how do you pass athletic commission standards? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2080.32s)]
*  So I I don't know. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2082.72s)]
*  So I think that from what I've heard, I think it depends on the commission [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2084.12s)]
*  and where you're fighting in P.A. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2089.16s)]
*  I know he has to have I think and I may be wrong. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2091.48s)]
*  So somebody don't roast me for it. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2094.0s)]
*  But I think you have to have I think it's called a 22, 2200. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2095.7200000000003s)]
*  You have to it's like has to be some type of visibility. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2098.6000000000004s)]
*  So you have to be able to see objects or. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2101.44s)]
*  Yeah, an object shapes something. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2103.4s)]
*  You have to be able to at least identify something out of that eye. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2105.28s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I think that is the craziest way to fight. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2108.96s)]
*  When you already have lost one eye, bro, he's bigger than me. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2113.6800000000003s)]
*  The kid I'm talking about is bigger than me. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2116.96s)]
*  He's bigger. He's bigger. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2118.6800000000003s)]
*  He's like 225 right now. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2119.56s)]
*  And he's in shape abs cut. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2120.84s)]
*  I'm telling you that I can't wait for this kid's future. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2122.72s)]
*  But but I but I train with all. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2126.9599999999996s)]
*  But my point is, is like I get back to a lot of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2128.56s)]
*  I try to get back to a lot of my teammates [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2131.4399999999996s)]
*  because I didn't I didn't let the things that hardened me [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2134.8399999999997s)]
*  and made me upset become a piece of shit. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2137.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think I'm a piece of shit. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I'm a good person. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2140.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, I don't think I'm the best person. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2142.08s)]
*  I'm not the nicest guy [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  by a long shot, right. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2145.6s)]
*  But I think it's this world is about what you get. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2146.72s)]
*  You give back and you know how you can. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2150.48s)]
*  If you're not giving back in some way with success that you have, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2152.52s)]
*  then I think you're a piece of shit. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2155.12s)]
*  I don't care if you're a billionaire. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2156.2s)]
*  You know, if you're not giving back [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2158.28s)]
*  and you're not trying to help the younger generation, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2159.96s)]
*  that's already so fucked up, especially the people, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2161.84s)]
*  especially your tribe. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2164.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I couldn't agree more. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2165.64s)]
*  The one thing, man, is it's just still really freaks me out. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2168.44s)]
*  Like shout out to Michael Bisping, one of the fucking toughest [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2171.7599999999998s)]
*  to ever do it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2175.6s)]
*  And he did in the dark. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2177.32s)]
*  He scammed systems. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2178.72s)]
*  He scammed the athletic commissions for 10 fights [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2180.6s)]
*  for 10 fights that do far with one. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2183.68s)]
*  But then look at one. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2185.36s)]
*  Look at the other part of it, right? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2186.24s)]
*  Like if he goes out there and he's getting smoked [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2187.48s)]
*  and he's not competitive, like, sure, pulls card and say, hey, can't do this. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2190.24s)]
*  But then you're going to tell somebody they can't [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2194.04s)]
*  they can't do what they've trained their whole life for. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2195.88s)]
*  Yes. Of something like that. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2197.56s)]
*  That's not fair, too. You know what I mean? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2199.08s)]
*  Like, right. Well, you look at Shara Bullitt, I mean, obviously, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2200.36s)]
*  I mean, depth perception is the first thing that goes when you lose one eye. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2203.04s)]
*  Yeah, it helps. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2206.36s)]
*  But Shara Bullitt is like one of the most accurate and precision strikers. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2207.44s)]
*  I mean, he's got some flaws in his game. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2211.32s)]
*  Let's take down defense. Terrible. Yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2213.88s)]
*  He's got to like learn how to wrestle. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2215.84s)]
*  A man did not know how to get off his back. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2217.76s)]
*  Which is crazy. It's from Dagestan. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2219.64s)]
*  From a guy that's not a wrestler. Right. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2220.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a problem. It's a problem. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  But also him on the feet is a fucking problem. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2225.32s)]
*  Oh, man. Guy that kicks that much. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2227.64s)]
*  I don't want to fight that guy. It is annoying. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2229.64s)]
*  I it's not even it's like I hate that kind of style. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2231.28s)]
*  That's like Jack style irritates the fuck out of me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  Jack Dylan, Madeline. No, Jack Hermansen. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2238.8s)]
*  Hermansen is annoying as shit. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2241.1600000000003s)]
*  I hate his style. Fucking bounces around and like he's just an awkward, weird, like weird shit. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2242.88s)]
*  Shara Bullitt's not weird, but you know, he's so he's so fast. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2249.32s)]
*  It kicks and man, I want to bang, not kick. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2252.2000000000003s)]
*  Hermansen and you is when? When is that? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2255.1200000000003s)]
*  February 10th. Nice. Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2257.5200000000004s)]
*  So like 25 days or some shit like that. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2258.88s)]
*  But not too far. I'm counting. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a very good fight for you. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2263.0s)]
*  It's a very good fight for me. I think. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2264.28s)]
*  I think a lot of people will try to pull this experience bullshit again. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2267.0s)]
*  And he's definitely my toughest fight on paper, and I think he will be my toughest test. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2270.4s)]
*  But one thing's for sure, he better not let me get that one as I got that one. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2275.0800000000004s)]
*  So he's a dog. He's tough. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2279.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think we know what his style is. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2282.1200000000003s)]
*  If you look at Jack, it's like you got to get the takedown, brother. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2284.44s)]
*  Because if you stand in bag with me, I'm going to put you down. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2287.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2289.84s)]
*  I'm not I'm not playing for decisions. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, shit, it might come back to bite me, right? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2293.48s)]
*  I might say it all confident. I might lose. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2296.76s)]
*  Might happen. But I just don't think that that's I don't think that's the next chapter for me. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2298.6s)]
*  And yeah, there it is. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2303.12s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a fight night. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2305.6s)]
*  Motherfucker on TV, man. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2307.48s)]
*  No, you look great. That's nonsense. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2308.96s)]
*  The fucking apex is the greatest place ever to see. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2310.88s)]
*  I like it. Everybody's complaining that I keep fighting there, but I like it, man. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2313.12s)]
*  I like hearing my shots. I like hearing that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2316.52s)]
*  Yeah, I want to hear it. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2319.12s)]
*  I want to I want to I want to hear him grunt when I hit him. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2320.68s)]
*  I want to hear him wince. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2323.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, I want to see it like I don't have any outside noise blocking that. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2324.52s)]
*  Well, you can hear your coach, you hear your corner. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2327.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, everything. It's to me, the like when we were doing the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2329.8799999999997s)]
*  covid fights, when we were doing a lot of the fights from the apex [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2335.2s)]
*  and including like world title fights like Francis in Ghana, when he beats Deepa, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2338.52s)]
*  there was no crowd, which was so crazy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2341.8799999999997s)]
*  But for me as a commentator and as an audience member, I was like, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2345.04s)]
*  how lucky am I that I'm here for this? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2349.44s)]
*  That this is like, you know, the whole world's fucking shut down. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2352.96s)]
*  And I get to be cage side for this with nobody else here. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2355.52s)]
*  It was a fortunate time, man. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2359.72s)]
*  It was it was a fortunate time to, I think, like being your position, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2360.96s)]
*  like you're saying, right? You know, yeah, you've been around for so long. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2363.92s)]
*  No, man, like you are in that right. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2367.04s)]
*  I mean, and you're you're a part of the UFC in a big, big way. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2369.0s)]
*  You're not just a commentator. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2373.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? So you being a part of that is also historic, too, you know. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  But being able to see it with a guy like that in person, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2377.08s)]
*  that's why I was upset when John Jones, man, I was going to go to that fight. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2380.84s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, man, because he's on his way out. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2383.64s)]
*  I love John Jones. I love John Jones, too. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2386.24s)]
*  That dude is I hate when everybody everybody so much sidesteps him. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2388.4s)]
*  I know. When he tore that peck muscle, I was so bummed out. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2392.44s)]
*  God damn, I wanted to see him versus Deepa. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2397.24s)]
*  I still hope maybe. Yeah, maybe. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2400.24s)]
*  I mean, maybe late summer. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2402.6s)]
*  It seems like that's what they want to do. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2404.12s)]
*  It seems like that's the fight they want to do. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2406.48s)]
*  He keeps vocalizing to to Tom Aspinall, you know what I mean? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2408.4s)]
*  And I feel like he already wrote like which we all kind of assume. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2411.84s)]
*  But I think he'll have that fight with Steve, if Steve is still hanging around [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2414.8s)]
*  and then, you know, kind of run off, run off into maybe or they'll [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2419.32s)]
*  maybe he'll do Aspinall, depending upon. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2423.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he has any interest to be. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2425.32s)]
*  You don't think so? No. Why not, man? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2427.0s)]
*  What elbow surgery also? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2430.0400000000004s)]
*  When did he have this? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2432.28s)]
*  He said while he was having peck surgery because he had to recover for so long, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2433.24s)]
*  he went ahead and got his elbow done, too. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2436.4799999999996s)]
*  Was this recently? Yeah, like I thought this I thought this was the video. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2438.52s)]
*  But this was like 11 weeks. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2441.12s)]
*  Wasn't this the day this was the day out right after or a couple days out [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2441.9599999999996s)]
*  after it happened, I think that video. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2446.2s)]
*  Oh, I'll find it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2448.64s)]
*  This is not recent, though, that punching thing is not. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2450.6s)]
*  This is like two weeks ago, a week ago. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2452.9199999999996s)]
*  I thought it was on his Instagram account, but I'll look it up real quick. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2454.9199999999996s)]
*  The thing is like, John is what, 36 now? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2458.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that how old he is? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2462.4s)]
*  No, I think he's I [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2463.04s)]
*  he's not I thought he was 38. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2465.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. I wonder. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2466.84s)]
*  I wonder what was John. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2468.44s)]
*  30s. Oh, I just had it right here. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2470.88s)]
*  But here's a week ago, he had elbow surgery to shave off. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2472.88s)]
*  Thirty six. Yeah, 36. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2475.84s)]
*  I thought he was a little bit older than that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2477.36s)]
*  Yeah. When you start getting surgeries, when shit starts falling off. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2478.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, that's me now. Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2482.76s)]
*  I have that one injury for sure. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2484.32s)]
*  John Jones said he has surgery to shave bone spurs in his left elbow. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2487.0s)]
*  So exactly that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2490.48s)]
*  So what I just told you about my pain in my elbow, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2492.04s)]
*  I have like six or seven of those in my elbow right now. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2495.1200000000003s)]
*  So imagine. And that's where all the nerves are. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2498.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, man, some days I got a [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2501.4s)]
*  I'm in pain. And they can't go in there and scoop those out. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2504.6400000000003s)]
*  Not before this fight. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2507.4s)]
*  After the fight, you think? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2509.28s)]
*  I'm definitely going to mention it. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2510.4s)]
*  I'm definitely going to mention it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2512.92s)]
*  Have you done any stem cells or anything for that? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2514.1200000000003s)]
*  So I had a torn labrum and I got some stem cells to try and fix that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2516.32s)]
*  And then honestly, it really agitated it where, you know, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  and then the fight got announced and everything. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2525.0s)]
*  So this this fight is sooner than I wanted it to be in a way. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2526.84s)]
*  But you don't say no to something like this. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2530.56s)]
*  Like this is a good fight for me. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2532.48s)]
*  I mean, when I say good fight. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2535.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that this is. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2537.32s)]
*  A fight that I'm very capable of winning [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2540.84s)]
*  at this point in time with the trajectory I'm on, with all the, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2543.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, people call it hype, but fucking earned it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2547.7200000000003s)]
*  This isn't hype. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2550.56s)]
*  This is called I paid my dues and I was out for a year and eight fucking months [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2551.32s)]
*  and made a comeback, made my comeback fight with a broken left hand. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2554.4s)]
*  Still knocked that dude out, which was Derek Brunson's wrestling coach [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2557.8s)]
*  came back, knocked out another guy. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2562.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I had a broken left hand going into that. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2563.92s)]
*  I don't mind. I broke my left hand, my left thumb in half, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2565.92s)]
*  like right where the joint is. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2570.6s)]
*  And I still went in there. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2572.16s)]
*  And I remember my coach was like, yo, we got to bite down. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2573.08s)]
*  We just got to do this, man. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2576.56s)]
*  Like you do this. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2577.96s)]
*  You're going back to the UFC. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2578.92s)]
*  It was the first time I ever worked with my head coach, John Marquez. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2580.52s)]
*  And how far out did you break your thumb? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2584.8s)]
*  I think it was nine days. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2589.76s)]
*  So, bro, when they grabbed my hand, like the commission, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2591.32s)]
*  like the medical tent, and they grabbed my hand, I was like, oh, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2594.8s)]
*  but I wound up getting it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2598.52s)]
*  I took an XL glove or double XL glove because, you know, my hands aren't that big. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2599.56s)]
*  But I bro, it was terrible. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2605.04s)]
*  It was terrible. Did you find a way to tape it in some way? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2607.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we still taped it up like it was a fight, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2610.3199999999997s)]
*  So I still had tons of pain, but the pressure stopped me from feeling [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2612.44s)]
*  like it was like floating around. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2615.72s)]
*  So and I actually threw it like maybe three, four times in that fight, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2618.04s)]
*  just out of like habit. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2622.16s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, first fight back here in eight months, breaker, breaker, left hand. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2624.3599999999997s)]
*  I have the X-ray for it. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2628.3599999999997s)]
*  And then, you know, let alone the nerves, I had to come back. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2630.92s)]
*  I'd never thrown my right hand in a real fight. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2635.68s)]
*  And man, it was awful. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2638.3199999999997s)]
*  And then three weeks later, I was playing basketball. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2641.0s)]
*  I love playing basketball and fucking broke my ankle. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2643.24s)]
*  And the UFC calls and says, hey, you want to fight on the contender series? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2646.2s)]
*  So when I say I've had injury after injury and it gets it gets keeps going. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2649.0s)]
*  What do you think? Like, maybe I shouldn't play basketball. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2652.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe I shouldn't do so. I don't plan on. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2655.48s)]
*  Yeah. So but, you know, so yeah, you know, but here's the thing. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2657.16s)]
*  I don't I my my theory on life could be wrong. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2660.68s)]
*  I don't want to I don't want to cheat myself along the way to do the things [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2665.2400000000002s)]
*  that I still love, you know, like, and if I have to stop, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2669.0s)]
*  if I have to live so fucking careful, I'm going to develop that habit [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2671.76s)]
*  to live like a fucking hermit crab. Right. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2675.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's not me, man. I get on a motorcycle. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2677.96s)]
*  I'm going to 105 fucking mile. Oh, that's Joe. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2679.92s)]
*  Don't do that. But that's but that's me, bro. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2682.32s)]
*  That's just that's I'm a real seeker. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2685.32s)]

*  His eyes are swarmed. Watch this fight. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2716.52s)]
*  So Diego Corrales is in the white with the red stripes. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2718.32s)]
*  OK. And Jose Luis Castillo, who's also a very tough guy, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2721.32s)]

*  His legs don't look and Castillo is a very big puncher. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2805.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he looks like he's with it. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2811.48s)]
*  And he gets clipped again. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2815.0s)]

*  Castillo punch himself. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2829.2799999999997s)]

*  You had other awesome cars on there, but not the Evo. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2986.16s)]
*  Jamie's areas. Macbook Pro. Yep. Cool. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2989.6s)]
*  Got it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2996.36s)]
*  Yeah, so that's been my therapy, right? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=2998.52s)]
*  So I've always wanted to be in the cars. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  My neighbor when I was young, you know, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3003.9199999999996s)]
*  his name was Henry Papiano. Good dude. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3007.4399999999996s)]
*  Like, honestly, I love him because we don't talk all the time. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3009.52s)]
*  And I haven't talked to him in years. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3013.2s)]
*  But yeah, that's my baby. That's a wild little car. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3014.4399999999996s)]
*  It was built the body and the paint. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3018.12s)]
*  That's an actual P1 McLaren paint job. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3019.8799999999997s)]
*  It's a real actual paint of it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3022.04s)]
*  And obviously, it's got the Vortex on there, the wheels. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3025.0s)]
*  So I bought the car built as is with a four G six four in it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3027.16s)]
*  But now it has a four G six three. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3030.04s)]
*  How many horsepower does that thing have? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3032.36s)]
*  That set up was the four G six four block. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3034.08s)]
*  So that made estimated from what I was told from who I bought it from [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3036.24s)]
*  that it made 808. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3041.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's got a full roll cage. So crazy. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3043.36s)]
*  Yeah, that car's got to weigh 2000 pounds. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3045.72s)]
*  Now, man, let me tell you, so is it way it's it's like four. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3047.68s)]
*  It's like almost 4000 pounds. Really? Is that heavy? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3050.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's 38 to 4100 pounds, something like that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3053.48s)]
*  Dude, that is like my tag. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3057.2400000000002s)]
*  Body bags, we got J.P. bags, baby. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3061.4s)]
*  So cars, man, I smile all day. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3064.92s)]
*  I could be around cars all day. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3067.6s)]
*  It's definitely something that's like a therapy for me. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3068.96s)]
*  It's how I found like, I don't know, man, I love it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3070.76s)]
*  I love it. 808 horsepower. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3073.16s)]
*  It's the most agile car. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3075.44s)]
*  So I've driven the Lamborghini Aventador, which was a dream car of mine. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3076.92s)]
*  Thanks. Royalty Exotics of Vegas. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3080.36s)]
*  They always hooked me up every fight. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3082.16s)]
*  Yeah, man, they're going down memory lane. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3085.64s)]
*  I was trying to find your car. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3088.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a wild car, man. Yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3090.08s)]
*  Yeah, I had that was the first Corvette ever bought. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3092.64s)]
*  It was a C5 Z06 stock as hell. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3094.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, those are fun cars, though. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3097.24s)]
*  It was a turd, but they're fun, though. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3098.56s)]
*  They're kind of plasticky. Yeah. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3100.96s)]
*  Yeah. But you know what? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3102.7999999999997s)]
*  I have to say, my dream car was a C6 Z06. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3103.88s)]
*  I went up getting one. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3106.6s)]
*  And then I didn't like the interior compared to that one. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3108.68s)]
*  Right. Because I like the leather. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3111.72s)]
*  I like the old look. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3113.12s)]
*  I don't like the plastic look of a lot of modern cars. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3113.92s)]
*  But Corvette nailed it with the new interior. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3116.84s)]
*  The new interior is perfect. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3119.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So the new interior is cool. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3120.28s)]
*  But I hate the C8 look because they took away from the traditional long [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3122.2000000000003s)]
*  snout, you know, real wheel drive. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3126.36s)]
*  Like now it's a mid engine short snout. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3128.4s)]
*  Like I'm not a fan of it and I can't fit in it very well. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3130.88s)]
*  Right. So I don't like it. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3133.88s)]
*  That's why I will never buy a Lamborghini. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3135.4s)]
*  I'll never buy a Ferrari. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3137.2000000000003s)]
*  I will buy a Porsche. I don't fit in it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3138.44s)]
*  And I think Porsche is ugly. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's really. Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  I know. Yo, I will say driving a GT3 is amazing, though. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3143.6s)]
*  But the Evo, man, I've never driven a car that fun in my life. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3147.12s)]
*  It's wild. You can do some of those Japanese cars, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3151.44s)]
*  like with some of the things that people do to GTRs. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3153.64s)]
*  Yeah, they have GTRs that are like 2000 horsepower. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3155.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. It's just called Godzilla's. Fucking insane. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3158.44s)]
*  Yeah. Have you ever been to a drag strip? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3161.88s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3164.08s)]

*  Just it's a 454 and just it's pumped up. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3312.52s)]
*  It's got like 650 horsepower. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3315.28s)]
*  It just it's a perfect balance. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  Big ass fat tires. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3318.88s)]
*  It's a roadster shop car to said handles and brakes real well. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3320.76s)]
*  But it's just there's something about that's exactly. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3324.0s)]
*  That's exactly what my neighbor had. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3326.52s)]
*  He had a Chevelle. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3328.0800000000004s)]

*  I remember being maybe six, seven years old. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3330.48s)]
*  And we were poor, man. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3334.36s)]
*  My parents combined never made more than thirty thousand in a household of seven combined. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3335.36s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I remember him ripping down. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3340.6400000000003s)]
*  He had an orange one. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3343.6400000000003s)]
*  He did the motor himself and he would rip down as soon as he put me. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3344.6s)]
*  You know what? I think that's what got me hooked on this adrenaline shit. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3347.88s)]
*  He took me for a ride one time. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3350.64s)]
*  I'm like, my dad's a deadbeat, bro. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3352.36s)]
*  I'll never get to do this. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3353.88s)]
*  So I was like, I want the neighbor to be my dad. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3354.96s)]
*  But he took me for a ride first time. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3357.4s)]
*  I went over 100 and I was like, I was just remember being like, oh, my God, dude, so cool. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3359.0s)]
*  And it's the sound, the feel of those things, too. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3365.92s)]
*  When I was I think I was like 16, a buddy of mine picked me up [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3369.24s)]
*  in his friend's car and his friend, they were, you know, just pick me up. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3372.96s)]
*  We're going to go somewhere. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3376.92s)]
*  And his friend had a 70 Chevelle and it was perfect. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3377.68s)]
*  It was just cherry. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3381.6s)]
*  It was a black with white stripes, the tuxedo, which is what I have. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3383.2s)]
*  And I remember thinking as six years old, how can this guy own this? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3387.2799999999997s)]
*  How is it possible that a person could own this perfect car? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3391.84s)]
*  I couldn't imagine it. I couldn't imagine it. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3396.24s)]
*  You remember how old you were? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  I think I was 16. I was in high school, for sure. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3400.44s)]
*  And I remember he ran out of gas and coasted. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3402.72s)]
*  He ran out of gas at the perfect time and coasted right into the gas station. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3406.2799999999997s)]
*  And it was like, this guy's the coolest guy that's ever lived. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3412.24s)]
*  He ran out of gas, got the perfect car. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3414.84s)]
*  He coasted into this gas station. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3416.7999999999997s)]
*  And I just remember here's what I like about the the the car people, the car world, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3418.56s)]
*  because if you're a car guy somewhere along the line, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3423.88s)]
*  I mean, especially if you're building your own cars, your blue collar, right? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3426.92s)]
*  Like they could teach you shit. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3429.4s)]
*  You know, I have these nerds today that they're calling AAA or, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3431.68s)]
*  I don't know, fucking double. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3435.72s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but they can't even change a tire. Right. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3436.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't know that. Where's the oil go? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3440.08s)]
*  And it's like, bro, you call yourself a man, but you can't change tire. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3441.96s)]
*  You can't change oil. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3445.0s)]
*  Like you don't know what to do if the car starts. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3446.04s)]
*  But you don't you don't know anything. You're useless. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3447.7999999999997s)]
*  That is the thing with modern cars. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3449.72s)]
*  You open them up and it's a computer. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3451.4s)]
*  There's just so much going on in there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3452.92s)]
*  And, you know, there's an ECU that's powering everything. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3454.56s)]
*  And that has to be not unless you got a standalone. That's true. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3457.8799999999997s)]
*  No, but that's that's actually the issue. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3462.6s)]
*  I think I'm going to run into with this new build on the EVO. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3464.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to get like a standalone and get it, get it tuned there, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3466.48s)]
*  you know, get like a MoTek or something like that. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3469.92s)]
*  And because there's only so much you could do with a stock ECU, you know, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3472.04s)]
*  and right like safety fails and shit like that. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3475.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm sure they probably have it on some of your cars, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3477.3199999999997s)]
*  but you got to have your safety fail so you don't blow it up again. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3479.04s)]
*  But you know, Gordon Ryan. Yes. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3481.68s)]
*  Gordon Ryan is now obsessed with Vipers. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3483.68s)]

*  Do you like that? It's got a thousand horsepower. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3631.24s)]

*  Yeah, I love that one. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3636.88s)]
*  Don't say it out loud. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3639.32s)]
*  Sean Brady would be upset with a slow-ass Ford Raptor. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, those are great, too. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3643.2400000000002s)]
*  No, they're good. He's got a nice one. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3644.36s)]
*  The Raptor is great. The new one, the Raptor R, the V8 one is insane. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3645.7200000000003s)]
*  And Hennessy's doing that, too. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3648.88s)]
*  He's taking that up to a thousand horsepower. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3650.16s)]
*  Is the Raptor R a twin turbo? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3651.44s)]
*  No, it must be. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3652.8s)]
*  It's either supercharged or twin turbo. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3654.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3657.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, regular Raptors are usually turboed. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3657.88s)]
*  So I can imagine that. The regular Raptor is a turbo six. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3660.12s)]
*  And this is I think it has the same engine as the GT 500. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3662.2s)]
*  I think that's the idea behind it, because it's 700 stock from the factory. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3667.8399999999997s)]
*  And then Hennessy takes it and he jacks it up. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3672.52s)]
*  So I'm 99 percent sure it's supercharged. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3674.96s)]
*  You don't remember this TV show? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3676.96s)]

*  It just changes the color. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3685.04s)]
*  Did you believe in Santa as a kid? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3686.44s)]

*  Growing up, we didn't get the joy. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3694.88s)]
*  There was no fucking Santa. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3696.6s)]
*  There was no like, hey, motherfucker, we ain't got money. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3698.08s)]
*  You're not getting no gifts. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3700.28s)]
*  Like we used to have the church like donate us like gifts and whatnot, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3701.28s)]
*  because I grew up Christian and whatnot. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3705.36s)]
*  But there was no Santa. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3706.92s)]
*  It's horrible for you as a child. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3709.36s)]
*  But I firmly believe that being poor as a kid is also a supercharger. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3711.52s)]
*  It's like a superpower. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3715.96s)]

*  successful in life, they're never going to have that same gear [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3726.84s)]
*  as a person who grows up poor. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3731.04s)]
*  There's something about growing up poor. It sucks. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3732.56s)]
*  It gives you a it gives you a burning desire for the things that you want. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3734.96s)]
*  And you want to figure it out. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3738.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, these kids that are born into money, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3740.4s)]
*  it's actually someone we both know where it's like sometimes and [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3743.44s)]

*  from at least my earliest memory of like four and a half, five years old. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3815.96s)]
*  And then until 15 years old, then we leave. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3820.2s)]
*  I go to P.A. with my dad because my mom basically hated my guts. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3823.2s)]
*  I was it was like it was such a divided family. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3827.08s)]
*  It was the girls and my mom that we lived like the farm life. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3830.36s)]
*  Like I grew up a farm boy and against like my dad and the fighter. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3834.04s)]
*  Right. Like like I was a puppet. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3838.48s)]
*  And, you know, I just mimicked everything that he said. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3840.16s)]
*  But, you know, I chose my dad because I didn't want to lose wrestling [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3843.24s)]
*  or jujitsu or boxing and everything. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3846.84s)]
*  But then when I got up, you know, but then when I got up to P.A., [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3849.04s)]
*  he had already had a girl he was laid up in that it was like [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3851.6s)]
*  that's all that mattered to him. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3855.04s)]
*  And then she worked. He doesn't work. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3856.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3858.76s)]
*  So he found somebody to prey on, to manipulate, to do his thing. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3859.2s)]
*  And then it was like, I don't need my kid no more after I went to court. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3862.28s)]
*  And, you know, I didn't understand the consequences of testifying, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3865.1600000000003s)]
*  testifying in court against your mom and being dragged to court out of school. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3868.76s)]
*  And that humiliation and, you know, I didn't talk to my mom [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3872.0s)]
*  and my sisters for years. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3877.76s)]

*  And we haven't talked since before I broke my arm. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3883.52s)]
*  Wow. Because I knocked my sister's boyfriend out for being a meth head. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3885.92s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3889.2400000000002s)]
*  So that is what it is. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3892.1600000000003s)]
*  But but yeah, man, I mean, once I moved up to P.A., [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=3894.4s)]

*  There was no remorse for anything he did. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4100.76s)]
*  And I think that's why I despise him. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4103.04s)]

*  I had a friend and I had a girlfriend, right. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4596.2s)]
*  Worst girl I ever met in my life. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4599.12s)]
*  Leave it at that. OK. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4602.04s)]
*  I've never known somebody. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4604.200000000001s)]
*  So I moved out of this place that was basically a shithole. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4606.4400000000005s)]
*  I started working at Verizon. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4610.400000000001s)]
*  It was my first job. And I said, hey, either I'm going into military [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4611.68s)]
*  because I don't know what the fuck I'm going to be with my life or I'm going to fight. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4615.08s)]

*  No job experience. Fucking idiot. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4624.6s)]
*  Somehow I landed it. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4626.16s)]
*  Got a job, started work and why not moving out, moved into a condo [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4627.599999999999s)]
*  across the street from my high school wrestling coach, who, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4630.76s)]
*  if you've seen the documentary, is super impactful on my life. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4633.639999999999s)]
*  So I move across. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4637.8s)]
*  Then I moved from there after a year. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4639.28s)]
*  I moved to another place, was only there for a short period of time. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4640.68s)]
*  Whole relationships wind up falling apart. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4644.4s)]
*  I was trying to fight while knowing somebody that I thought was a best friend [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4646.12s)]
*  had fucked around with my girl while he was engaged to his girl. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4649.68s)]
*  And that was my fucking living situation. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4652.8s)]
*  And I was so, you know, eager to have a best friend [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4655.36s)]
*  that the motherfucker was never a best friend. Right. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4660.08s)]
*  And it was like. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4662.76s)]
*  Man, you got I got the heartbreak that I got every fucking turn. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4664.96s)]
*  And this was two weeks before I had one of the biggest fights [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4669.92s)]
*  that really put me on a trajectory like, man, I'm going to [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4672.84s)]
*  I'm going to kill everybody on fighting. And. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4675.84s)]
*  So that happened two weeks before. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4680.6s)]
*  Then that was when I broke it off with my dad. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4682.32s)]
*  He came over and he got in my face one time. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4684.32s)]
*  And then it was the only time ever I never put my hands on him. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4686.599999999999s)]
*  I never fought back and never even put my hands on him to this day. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4689.24s)]
*  And but it was one of those times where, you know, how when you [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4692.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever had this moment where somebody gets in your face [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4696.28s)]
*  and you're a kid and you have the chain quivering, you're like fucking nervous. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4698.759999999999s)]
*  And it's like it's almost like you're trapped in fear. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4701.36s)]
*  Man, he said some shit about putting a bullet in my head. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4704.84s)]
*  He said he was going to come back and put a bullet in my head. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4708.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, motherfucker, before you get to that car, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4710.84s)]
*  I was like, I'm a bury you like that's it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4713.24s)]
*  Like I'll take out every fucking part of my angry being to destroy you. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4715.4s)]
*  You will not make it to your car. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4720.599999999999s)]
*  Like that's it. You're done. Like you die. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4721.96s)]
*  And I think it was the first time like that motherfucker knew like [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4724.48s)]
*  he always knew I was better. Like 16 years old, I could submit him. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4728.5599999999995s)]
*  He was a brown belt in jujitsu, but I could beat him. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4731.44s)]
*  And I think that started to intimidate him. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4733.96s)]
*  And I think that's why the beatings got worse and worse and worse. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4735.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think he was scared that I was going to come like rise up against him. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4739.5199999999995s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, that was the last time. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4744.12s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, shit, man. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4746.88s)]
*  So I've just had like betrayal, betrayal, betrayal, betrayal. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4749.12s)]
*  But I haven't lost faith in people. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4753.24s)]
*  You know, I met a couple of really good ones that changed my life. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4754.44s)]
*  And you never let them know. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4757.16s)]
*  The horrible thing about having horrible people in your life [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4758.76s)]
*  is it can ruin your faith in people. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4761.28s)]
*  But the one thing that it does do, it makes you really appreciate good people. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4763.12s)]
*  Yeah. If you can if you can get past it, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4769.12s)]
*  you could really like you don't appreciate sunshine unless you experience a lot of rain. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4772.5199999999995s)]

*  and then start strangling her in between the cushions. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4947.5199999999995s)]
*  And then we all have to fight him to get him off. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4949.8s)]
*  That's your response to your daughter who's suicidal. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4952.8s)]
*  And I mean, so like when I say and we were all mean to each other, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4956.68s)]
*  that made it even worse. We were all mean. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4959.400000000001s)]
*  We were all carrying in that moment because we knew like this isn't right. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4961.120000000001s)]
*  Seeing him hit my mom, cops being in our house 12 times a year and shit like that. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4964.080000000001s)]
*  Like, like I grew up dysfunctional. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4968.52s)]
*  That shit fucked me up and it fucked me up when I was toxic. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4971.6s)]
*  I was, you know, negative. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4975.04s)]
*  And I'm still like toxic and negative. Right. But like [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4976.120000000001s)]
*  you learn who people are. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4979.12s)]
*  And when you see that kind of shit, I can have conversations like a conversation [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4980.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to have like you're you can talk about anything. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4984.04s)]
*  You're open minded, like, but you're also you got your beliefs, right? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4986.04s)]
*  Like you're a real person. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4989.16s)]
*  I don't like everybody because you know, when somebody's got this fake face [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4991.0s)]
*  and my dad was one of those people, he had them fucking fake face, man. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4996.28s)]
*  But the second he could get you in that door to hurt you, he would take it. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=4999.68s)]
*  And it's like. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5003.28s)]
*  When you see when you when you grow up with that, it just makes you angry. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5005.24s)]
*  And then that's why it's like you're going to take half my purse. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5008.16s)]
*  This motherfucker is my toughest test. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5011.28s)]
*  You want to take it from me? Come on, try it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5013.2s)]
*  And you might be if you beat me, you're one of the best in the world in my mind. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5016.0s)]
*  And I've never I can I can honestly say this through all that shit. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5018.839999999999s)]
*  I have such a strong confidence in myself where it's like, man, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5023.0s)]
*  ain't no man beaten me until it's been done. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5025.879999999999s)]
*  It's not happening. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5028.5199999999995s)]
*  I have a loss on my career as an amateur [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5029.5199999999995s)]
*  because I was 174 pounds fighting at one eighty five training [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5032.72s)]
*  twice a week with a full time job with that girl that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5035.96s)]
*  This fucked me up. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5040.04s)]
*  My first pro loss, struggling with suicide, depression, things like that, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5042.0s)]
*  still hadn't settled that beef with myself. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5046.88s)]
*  First time I ever went no fight was absolutely dominating the fight. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5049.400000000001s)]
*  I still this guy's name is Jonathan Potti. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5053.12s)]
*  Love the guy. Super nice guy. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5055.16s)]
*  Still talk to him. We never want to fight him again. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5056.4400000000005s)]
*  But it was a good loss for me. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5059.12s)]
*  And then you got my arm break. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5061.92s)]
*  I got one real loss, man. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5064.28s)]
*  And I got one I got lost to myself. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5065.64s)]
*  I lost to my fucking mental. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5067.96s)]
*  Like I lost to I lost before I got in. Right. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5069.96s)]
*  So it's just you're in a very good spot now, though. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5073.4s)]
*  And I want to talk to you about like where you fit in in the UFC's [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5077.0s)]
*  middleweight division, because you're like what I would call on the cusp. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5080.0s)]
*  Like you're a guy. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5083.5199999999995s)]
*  The Jack or Manson fight is going to put you into a great place if you win that. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5084.44s)]
*  But you're in that conversation. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5088.84s)]
*  Two more fights in a title. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5090.96s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5092.2s)]
*  Like within the next year or two, you could be fighting for a title. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5093.04s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm going to be smart, man. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5096.04s)]
*  You know, mental health is something I fight every day. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5098.4400000000005s)]
*  And the reason I keep bringing it up is because I'm going to fight [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5101.12s)]
*  and I'm going to win and then I'm going to take some time [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5104.64s)]
*  and I'm going to go on vacation and I'm going to settle some things [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5107.56s)]
*  I got in myself, you know, within myself. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5110.88s)]
*  And you feel like that's something that you have to do, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5113.4400000000005s)]
*  like something you put off. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5115.24s)]
*  Now, when you say, do you work with anybody? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5118.44s)]
*  Do you have a therapist or? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5120.879999999999s)]
*  So I just have a lot of people that I talk to close. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5122.5599999999995s)]
*  I've tried therapy like three, four times, and I've never really gotten a benefit from it. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5124.839999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's just because I haven't met the right one [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5130.28s)]
*  or they haven't been able to get through to me. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5133.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, I'm not an open person where I like I'm an open person. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5135.04s)]
*  Like I can talk about these things, right? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5138.32s)]
*  And I may get upset about some of them and I still evoke strong emotion from it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5139.839999999999s)]
*  But [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5144.36s)]
*  just because you're listening doesn't mean that I trust you with what I'm telling you. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5146.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? For you to give feedback and then me to receive it [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5150.28s)]
*  in a way where I think, OK, let me apply this. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5152.759999999999s)]
*  So I just sometimes I feel like therapy is just another fucked up human being [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5154.759999999999s)]
*  telling another person, hey, you shouldn't feel like this, but [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5158.24s)]
*  or you should try this and try that. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5161.679999999999s)]
*  But that's why I love cars so much. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5163.08s)]
*  That's why I love cars. I love nature. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5165.28s)]
*  And I also want to take time because I haven't taken a vacation [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5167.12s)]
*  since I've been in UFC and a couple of years before that. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5170.04s)]
*  I haven't taken a vacation since before I broke my arm. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5172.839999999999s)]
*  And I think part of, you know, one of my biggest things isn't holding the UFC title, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5174.88s)]
*  but one of my biggest things is buying a beach house and that supercar. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  I've always wanted that Dodge Viper and, you know, having a loved one [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5183.8s)]
*  and going and traveling the world before I'm dead. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5188.2s)]
*  I think that's what my idea of peace and happiness is. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5190.16s)]
*  And I'm desperately searching for it. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5193.12s)]
*  And I mean, like I said, you get a lot of power off the horrible experiences [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5195.52s)]
*  of your childhood, but the key is to not be trapped. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5200.16s)]
*  And that's where some people have to, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5202.72s)]
*  you have to figure out a way to come to grips with your life [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5205.84s)]
*  and just accept it and to move forward in a positive way. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5211.96s)]
*  You're obviously a very good guy. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5215.72s)]
*  You're obviously an incredibly hard worker and you're obviously very successful. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5217.64s)]
*  And you're obviously haunted by your childhood. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5220.84s)]
*  But someone could probably help you develop the tools that you need [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5223.12s)]
*  to be successful. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5229.16s)]
*  But someone could probably help you develop the tools to put that aside. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5230.64s)]
*  It's never going to go away. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5234.76s)]
*  It's always going to be inside of you. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5236.88s)]
*  That monster, he's always going to be in a cage. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5238.120000000001s)]
*  But I'm OK with that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5241.0s)]
*  But it's good to be... [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5242.200000000001s)]
*  You're not going to forget it, Joe. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5243.4800000000005s)]
*  You're never going to forget it, Joe. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5244.72s)]
*  Joe, you're never going to forget it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5246.120000000001s)]
*  But the key is to not let it consume you all the time. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5247.4400000000005s)]
*  And that is where someone can probably help you. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5250.200000000001s)]
*  You're never going to forget it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5252.96s)]
*  There's a monster that's going to be inside of you whenever you need him. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5253.96s)]
*  That's not going to go away. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5257.8s)]
*  It's just not going to go away. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5259.32s)]
*  But to not live with it all the time would be very beneficial for you. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5261.08s)]
*  Because then you would get all of the positive attributes that come from having a horrible [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5266.4s)]
*  childhood, which is this unstoppable drive, this fury that you can unleash inside the [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5271.639999999999s)]
*  octagon that's very different than other people's. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5276.679999999999s)]
*  But you can get to the point where it doesn't consume your everyday life. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5279.2s)]
*  And it's not something you have to think about all the time. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5284.08s)]
*  And you can think about positive things. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5286.96s)]
*  And you think about growth and expansion and progress. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5288.44s)]
*  And I think you're very capable of doing that. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5292.0s)]
*  It's just so many people, rightly so, dwell on the horrible experiences of their childhood [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5294.799999999999s)]
*  forever. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5302.679999999999s)]
*  And there comes a time where that doesn't serve you anymore. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5303.919999999999s)]
*  And it rots at you. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5308.28s)]
*  Where even with success, you're still angry. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5310.2s)]
*  Even with success, you're still bitter. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5312.28s)]
*  Even with success, you still want to talk about it. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5314.16s)]
*  You want to live it again. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5316.16s)]
*  And you want to go over it in your head. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5317.16s)]
*  And that can rot you out from the inside. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5319.5599999999995s)]
*  Because at a certain point in time, your mind can't handle it anymore. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5323.16s)]
*  Yeah, I would say I grew emotionally thin when I lost my first pro fight. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5327.2s)]
*  That's where I was. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5332.4s)]
*  I can talk about it now. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5334.08s)]
*  And I can evoke those strong emotions, what I remember with it. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5335.08s)]
*  But I forgive them. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5338.599999999999s)]
*  I view my dad now as somebody, like I said, I don't respect as a man. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5342.56s)]
*  Because I don't think he's the definition of what a man's supposed to be for someone [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5346.64s)]
*  that teaches their kids useful tools and whatnot. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5350.200000000001s)]
*  But I've forgiven him because I think it's beyond his help because he never got help. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5352.52s)]
*  Because he never settled with his. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5358.9800000000005s)]
*  Now that is a man that has aged terribly because of his past and his demons that he's never [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5360.56s)]
*  let go. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5365.68s)]
*  And I don't want to be like that. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5366.68s)]
*  Well, you're not going to be like that. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5367.68s)]
*  Well, I'm already not like that. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5368.68s)]
*  I'm the only I'm the Joseph I'm Joseph Oliver Pfeiffer, the fifth, and I'm going to be the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5370.04s)]
*  last because I think I need to make a lasting impression for my name. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5374.64s)]
*  And I'm the first person that's ever, you know, like none of them have been to college [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5379.88s)]
*  educated, including me. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5383.12s)]
*  At a certain point, you know, I've become successful enough. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5384.6s)]
*  I want to go to college and get some type of degree. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5387.4800000000005s)]
*  And do you read? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5390.52s)]
*  Not a big reader, but I watch documentaries, watch podcasts, Joe Rogan podcast. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5393.76s)]
*  Don't rely on this for education. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5400.12s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5401.56s)]
*  It's right. But it's it brings a lot. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5402.92s)]
*  Your podcast brings a lot of diversity, a lot of like you have to be open minded to [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5405.72s)]
*  listen to every episode. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5410.240000000001s)]
*  Right. You have to like there's a lot of different perspectives from a lot of different, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5411.400000000001s)]
*  successful people. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5415.160000000001s)]
*  Right. So but now I'm really big on listening to people that have been through like [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5416.64s)]
*  traumatic things. I like listen to a lot of like like army vets that have spoken like [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5421.08s)]
*  Nicholas Irving, the first black American sniper who had like 33 confirmed kills or [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5425.64s)]
*  something like that. I watched his documentary and to hear the trauma that he's gone [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5430.92s)]
*  through and the things that he's done and how he is still making a good impact for [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5434.360000000001s)]
*  other people. You know, that that was that's a powerful dude. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5439.12s)]
*  And my life is very common across the world. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5443.200000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, unfortunately, it's very common. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5448.96s)]
*  So I think I find light and you always hear me say, I don't know if you've recognized, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5453.36s)]
*  but after every fight, I don't want to be a role model, but I want to be an inspiration [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5457.719999999999s)]
*  for the kids that it's like, hey, stay in a sport. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5461.24s)]
*  Don't let that sport go. And whatever that unspoken is that stops you from quitting, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5463.88s)]
*  follow it. And if it's in wrestling or if it's in soccer or if it's in basketball, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5469.48s)]
*  keep doing it. I used to get laughed at my whole life. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5474.2s)]
*  I would sit at the cafeteria. I stopped sitting with kids. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5477.12s)]
*  I would play chess every day with my wrestling coach during lunch because kids would [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5479.6s)]
*  laugh at me every time I said I'm going to be in the UFC. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5484.320000000001s)]
*  Everybody would snuff, you know, like like like giggle at it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5486.88s)]
*  So I just remove myself, put myself in a better situation. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5490.96s)]
*  I didn't like this friendship. I got out of it. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5495.200000000001s)]
*  I moved to a place where I could pursue fighting. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5497.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, I found people that were chasing things themselves. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5499.56s)]
*  Right. You know, so I think it's just about putting yourself around the right people and [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5503.360000000001s)]
*  and constantly wanting to evolve. If you stop evolving, you pass away. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5507.639999999999s)]
*  That's a giant part of it. Putting yourself around the right people. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5511.12s)]
*  Either it's through watching documentaries about the right people, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5513.84s)]
*  if you don't have access to the right people, or if you're very fortunate like yourself [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5516.639999999999s)]
*  to get to a gym with as great people and just to live like my [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5520.4s)]
*  gym is my family. Yeah. You know what I mean? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5525.4s)]
*  My gym is my family. I know I know a Sean and shit and I always talk about him. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5527.5199999999995s)]
*  I always talk about him because when I joined that team, man, I was not in the [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5531.599999999999s)]
*  I was not in the UFC and. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5535.879999999999s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people had a lot of faith in me, but Coach John took me in, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5538.919999999999s)]
*  never charged me a penny, you know, and I couldn't afford to. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5542.16s)]
*  I couldn't have afforded it if he did. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5545.48s)]
*  And I made the switch before I even got the second surgery. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5547.719999999999s)]
*  You know, he cornered me and I feel it like I feel I can look at them [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5551.639999999999s)]
*  and know that they like they get emotional, too. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5556.28s)]
*  Like we're fighting for something big here. Right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5558.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, fighting to change my life still. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5561.36s)]
*  So there's a big fight coming up this weekend, obviously. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5563.76s)]
*  Sean Strickland and Drekas Duplassie. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5566.68s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5568.76s)]
*  That's your division. Yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5571.16s)]
*  Both very beatable. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5573.96s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5575.52s)]
*  I like Sean Strickland. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5577.240000000001s)]
*  I like Sean Strickland. I like Drekas DDP, too. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5578.72s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm going to go the American way. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5582.4400000000005s)]
*  I want to vote. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5584.52s)]
*  I hope the American boy keeps it here in America. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5585.84s)]
*  But Drekas is a very unusual guy. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5589.360000000001s)]
*  He's a very unorthodox power puncher like Ford, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5592.48s)]
*  but there's a lot of openings to clip him and he doesn't have a granite chin in my pit. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5595.96s)]
*  He could take a shot. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5599.5599999999995s)]
*  But like if like I don't think he's fought anybody that could test his chin yet. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5600.32s)]
*  So besides, that's not true. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5605.04s)]
*  Let me shut up before I get hated on. Right. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5607.96s)]
*  Robert Whitaker was a was a dog, but he had Robert Roberts number, man. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5610.04s)]
*  He had to get a good plan. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5614.48s)]
*  And he's deceptively technical. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5615.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he's just exactly. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5617.4s)]
*  So he knows he knows where I think he's a guy. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5618.839999999999s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5621.16s)]
*  I think he's a guy that knows what he's good at and knows how to get there quick. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5621.8s)]
*  And that's why he comes out hot because he knows how he's going to wear on you. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5625.28s)]
*  Also, like yourself, he's very big for the weight class. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5628.2s)]
*  I haven't seen him in person. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5630.76s)]
*  He's a big boy. Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5632.04s)]
*  And he looks like a fucking heavyweight. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5633.2s)]
*  But you know what? I watched this interview on the way here on the flight. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5634.88s)]
*  And he's not stupid. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5637.96s)]
*  He's a smart guy. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5640.4400000000005s)]
*  And I have respect for I have respect for all. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5641.6s)]
*  I don't think you get that far if you're stupid. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5644.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, you don't. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5646.360000000001s)]
*  You'd be surprised, man. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5647.68s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's some dumbass people in this. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5648.76s)]
*  Not at the top. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5650.92s)]
*  Yeah, not at the top, not the cream of the crop. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5652.28s)]
*  You don't get to that level. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5654.04s)]
*  Yeah, you have to have some innate form of intelligence. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5655.76s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5659.32s)]
*  So you also have to be coachable. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5660.04s)]
*  Yes. I have a lot of respect for Sean because Sean, when I fought, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5661.64s)]
*  Gerald was in the back and even before I was in the UFC, he said, hey, you want to come train? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5665.36s)]
*  And I said no, because I knew it was like, man, like, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5669.24s)]
*  I don't like training with people that I'm going to have to fight. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5672.12s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5674.28s)]
*  But I got respect for him. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5675.36s)]
*  I like his story. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5676.8s)]
*  It's kind of a crazy style. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5678.0s)]
*  I don't like listening to him talk. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5679.68s)]
*  He sounds like a drunk person to me. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5682.240000000001s)]
*  So I'm not like a but. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5683.68s)]
*  Well, he also like you came from a very abusive child. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5685.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5688.200000000001s)]
*  And man, look at what he's done. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5689.16s)]
*  It's amazing. Look at what he's done. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5691.320000000001s)]
*  And he's not he's not a style that you're like, oh, my God. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5692.68s)]
*  But you're a style like, man, this is unorthodox and it works for him. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5696.240000000001s)]
*  He knows what he's good at. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5698.96s)]
*  He's confident in what he's good at. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5700.04s)]
*  And he's put himself in the fire against some of the best. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5701.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. To figure out that it works. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5703.88s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, I do think [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5705.96s)]
*  that DDP has the bigger advantage in this fight. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5709.64s)]
*  And why? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5712.88s)]
*  In the way that Sean has been [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5715.04s)]
*  chin checked a few times and I, I think, like, you know, competitively, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5716.320000000001s)]
*  I think that Sean is the easier guy to beat. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5722.04s)]
*  If he's a hard guy to hit, he's a hard guy to hit. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5725.160000000001s)]
*  But when you hit him, he reacts big, I think. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5727.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think a style like DDP is perfect for it. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5730.68s)]
*  I think he's going to make him like it's unorthodox like Sean. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5733.400000000001s)]
*  You know, he could be standing right there, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5737.56s)]
*  but he's really good at his range. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5738.8s)]
*  He knows how to you'll just miss. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5740.0s)]
*  You hit his hands, you hit his forearms. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5741.8s)]
*  He lifts his leg. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5744.2s)]
*  He keeps you like standing straight up. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5745.08s)]
*  It's really strange. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5747.28s)]
*  And he's actually a hard guy to keep down. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5748.320000000001s)]
*  I think people underestimate Sean Strickland's Jiu Jitsu abilities. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5750.52s)]
*  Right. No, it's just he's very high level. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5753.28s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, they're both good, man. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5755.12s)]
*  That's what I think. I think they're both good. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5756.4800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I hope I hope the belt stays here in America. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5757.72s)]
*  Were you shocked when DDP beat down Robert Whitaker like that? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5763.04s)]
*  I was I was surprised that he did it the way he did it. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5767.08s)]
*  I I didn't count him out. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5770.72s)]
*  But I didn't have him winning. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5774.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, I definitely thought that it was going to be close. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5775.76s)]
*  It was going to be tough. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5778.32s)]
*  I really did. A lot of people counted him out. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5779.72s)]
*  I was like, that's crazy, bro. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5781.6s)]
*  This guy's not I think he was 20 and two or something like that. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5782.68s)]
*  Yeah. Man, this dude, this dude can bring it like he's going to make it a dogfight. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5785.64s)]
*  And I don't care how technical you are when somebody makes it ugly. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5789.2s)]
*  Your energy levels down and you're not that technical or more. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5792.88s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, I thought it was pretty impressive. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5795.84s)]
*  I was very impressed. I was surprised that you take him down. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5799.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's a big guy, man. Yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5802.08s)]
*  I got to see him, man. I keep hearing that. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5804.84s)]
*  I was big. I mean, I don't know what you want. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5806.68s)]
*  You see it that when you start your cut, what do you walk around at? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5808.92s)]
*  218 218. Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5812.12s)]
*  Oh, wait. Start my cut fight week. Yeah. I'll be like 208. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5813.92s)]
*  OK. But when you're in training before you start any cut, you're about 218. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5816.96s)]
*  You have 218, 220. And the heaviest you get is that. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5821.2s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5824.36s)]
*  I it's like my cap. I won't go any bigger. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5825.4s)]
*  I'll have to go up a weight class. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5827.5599999999995s)]
*  And I might in a couple of years, you know, but I think I would take [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5829.08s)]
*  I would take the proper time to not be disrespectful [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5832.12s)]
*  in front of fucking guys, big as Johnny Walker or somebody like that. Right. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5834.8s)]
*  You know, uncle live that the thick bone, thick guys. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5838.2s)]
*  I think a lot of people underestimate like. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5841.04s)]
*  There's bone density that comes with a certain size, too. Yes. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5844.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? I would have to frame myself [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5846.84s)]
*  a little more muscular than these guys. I have the frame to do it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5849.5599999999995s)]
*  And take like a good six months to a year to build myself [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5854.599999999999s)]
*  to then make that move up. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5857.599999999999s)]
*  Do you find it increasingly difficult to get to one eighty five? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5858.72s)]
*  I do. I do. Yeah, it sucks. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5862.5599999999995s)]
*  It's this rough. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5865.12s)]
*  So you're definitely not 208 the week of the cut to await. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5866.16s)]
*  And then I'm already like, sure. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5870.4s)]
*  Yeah, like I'll show you like what I look like. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5872.72s)]
*  And are you using who are you using to do this? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5875.68s)]
*  Using a nutritionist and a weight cutting expert? No, no. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5879.0s)]
*  I'm just not. Yeah, I used the guy Castro with UFCP. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5882.88s)]
*  I have been great. OK. Charles a little bit. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5886.6s)]
*  OK, well, you have CPI. Those guys. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5889.0s)]
*  But I don't like I like I keep I keep them updated with my weight cut [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5890.92s)]
*  as I'm coming down. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5894.4400000000005s)]
*  But I don't do like I don't know how people fucking water [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5895.400000000001s)]
*  live, man. I don't like it. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5898.2s)]
*  I don't like the water loads. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5900.16s)]
*  I do my cut like I know my body pretty well. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5901.400000000001s)]
*  And I get down, but it's just it's just I don't know. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5904.08s)]
*  Is your cut primarily sauna or do you bike ride with a wet suit? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5907.8s)]
*  Twice a day still. Yeah. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5911.92s)]
*  Yeah. I sweet sweat. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5913.4800000000005s)]
*  Do a couple of rounds, pad work, get the get the sweat flowing, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5916.4800000000005s)]
*  do a couple of ground and pound, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5919.28s)]
*  you know, wrestling drills and then do a couple of ground and pound rounds. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5921.36s)]
*  And then I'll just take in very little water, take in very little water, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5924.6s)]
*  you know, the proper nutrition, they kill the sugar cravings [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5928.8s)]
*  and the hunger and shit like that. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5932.12s)]
*  But yeah, I do. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5933.68s)]
*  I've been getting better and better and better and better at it. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5934.8s)]
*  But it's still hard, still very hard. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5937.8s)]
*  And do you have a protocol as far as rehydration? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5939.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I've been drinking whatever the UFC gives me, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5942.52s)]
*  like their rehydration. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5946.0s)]
*  And then I'm really big on like like sodium and potassium intakes [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5947.160000000001s)]
*  and whatnot, obviously. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5951.08s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I have a couple of drinks that I drink, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5952.04s)]
*  but it's just like a BPN, electrolyte, try to get that back in there, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5956.200000000001s)]
*  try to get as much salt as possible so I can hold what I'm putting in my body. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5959.64s)]
*  And what do you try to weigh day of the fight? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5963.08s)]
*  Whatever my body's whatever my body's happy, I don't want to overeat [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5965.56s)]
*  and I don't want to over drink where I feel so bloated or feel so heavy. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5968.84s)]
*  But I probably walk in around 210, 208. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5972.240000000001s)]
*  So I blow up. Yeah, that's like like. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5975.88s)]
*  So when I fought Gerald, I [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5978.96s)]
*  when I fought Gerald, I was. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5981.96s)]
*  I was I was heavy. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5985.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I was like 209 when I walked into the cage. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5987.04s)]
*  But by the time I faced off with him by 4 p.m., I was like 203, 204. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5990.12s)]
*  So I was like, I put it on quick and I don't lose it. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5995.56s)]
*  Like I'll wake up the next morning and it goes right back to where it needs to. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=5998.2s)]
*  So I have a good system [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6001.599999999999s)]
*  and I think it's only going to get better. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6004.2s)]
*  But but man, you know, I'm not going to put it out there, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6005.88s)]
*  but I have never had a smooth camp. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6008.72s)]
*  I've never had a smooth camp. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6011.76s)]
*  And this is going to be no different. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6013.08s)]
*  But this is where I've been built. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6014.24s)]
*  I've been built in the fire. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6015.48s)]
*  And, you know, Jack's a good dude. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6016.679999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a tough fight. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6019.84s)]
*  I don't know of anybody who has a good camp. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6020.84s)]
*  They say they have good camps. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6023.0s)]
*  We talked to them. It's like a rib and a neck and a knee. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6024.36s)]
*  Everybody across the states lately, though, has been sick as fuck. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6027.44s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6032.4s)]
*  It's a lot of colds going on. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6034.08s)]
*  I've been gone. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6035.08s)]
*  I've been going as far as to say somebody's fucking poisoning us [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6036.4s)]
*  because there's no way that everybody I fucking know got sick at the same time [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6039.5199999999995s)]
*  and everybody's sick for two, three weeks with it. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6043.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, there's a covid strain that's going around right now. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6045.639999999999s)]
*  And then there's the flu. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6047.84s)]
*  I mean, it's the winter. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6049.44s)]
*  And you know what a lot of that is, is vitamin D deficiency, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6050.4s)]
*  especially when you're dealing with cold climates. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6053.48s)]
*  I take vitamin D and vitamin K as well. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6056.080000000001s)]
*  I take vitamin K, vitamin D, and I take it with magnesium, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6059.84s)]
*  because what I was told is if you don't take magnesium, it doesn't mean shit. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6062.76s)]
*  It doesn't mean as much. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6065.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Magnesium is important. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6067.8s)]
*  Do you take like a suite of nutrients? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6070.040000000001s)]
*  Do you know what to do as far as like how much to take of this and that? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6073.0s)]
*  Do you have so I have so I just have like my morning routine of everything [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6076.52s)]
*  I've taken and I got it from the USCPI. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6080.320000000001s)]
*  You know, they gave me a sheet and then I've been doing it for [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6082.52s)]
*  long enough now that it's like I know what I need. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6085.08s)]
*  So I was a CPI. Such a great resource. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6087.0s)]
*  It's a great resource. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6089.12s)]
*  When they first built that, I was like, what are they doing? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6090.320000000001s)]
*  Bro, I was fucking blown away when I was out there for Brendan Allen cornering him. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6092.08s)]
*  I had never been in the cafeteria. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6095.76s)]
*  I always heard people talk about it. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6097.320000000001s)]
*  I'm like, where the fuck is it? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6098.56s)]
*  Like, I never knew how to get to it. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6099.64s)]
*  It's funny. Oh, man. I was so upset. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6101.52s)]
*  I was so mad at myself. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6103.16s)]
*  I've been in this shit for a year and a half now. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6104.24s)]
*  Year and I didn't know there was a fucking cafeteria. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6106.2s)]
*  Everybody was going to but me. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6108.4400000000005s)]
*  Super healthy food. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6109.92s)]
*  Amazing state of the art facility. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6111.24s)]
*  The best stuff for recovery, the best stuff for training. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6113.36s)]
*  Amazing coaches. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6116.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I will say, though, so I think it's a great place. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6117.759999999999s)]
*  I'm not comfortable training in a place like that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6120.04s)]
*  Really? You like it dirty. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6122.0s)]
*  Bro, I like a fucking rat. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6123.599999999999s)]
*  I'm a ratchet motherfucker. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6124.84s)]
*  Like, I bro, I'm wearing sweatpants under this. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6126.12s)]
*  Like when he fought Drago. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6129.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking Siberia running with the log. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6131.28s)]
*  It's not me, Joe. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6133.44s)]
*  I don't I got an aura ring to track my sleep. Right. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6134.28s)]
*  And someone that made that like important to me was Sean, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6136.639999999999s)]
*  because my fucking sleep sucked. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6139.08s)]
*  But now I'm like so conscious about it. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6141.08s)]
*  Sean's taught me so much, man. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6143.28s)]
*  Sean has taught me so much. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6144.88s)]
*  That's a guy that needs to slow down, in my opinion. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6145.92s)]
*  I've never seen somebody train that much. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6148.679999999999s)]
*  Like I picture him as like a fucking disgruntled, old, mean motherfucker. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6150.88s)]
*  Like just like I didn't fucking have it. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6155.8s)]
*  Like he just didn't do anything fun. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6157.88s)]
*  Like, but but that's not true. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6159.32s)]
*  He does fun shit. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6161.24s)]
*  But like he loves working out. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6162.04s)]
*  Me. It's my job. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6163.759999999999s)]
*  And I love working out. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6165.48s)]
*  But that's not all I want to do. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6166.8s)]
*  I want to go fuck off sometimes. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6168.0s)]
*  Race and ride bikes and, you know, Sean wants to train. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6169.24s)]
*  He wants to do jujitsu competitions when it's all done. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6172.68s)]
*  Yeah, man. Yeah. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6175.12s)]
*  He needs to get on the sauce when he's done and get fucking go fuck people up. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6176.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you think about him beating Craig Jones in a grappling match. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6180.0s)]
*  And again, they didn't have heel hooks, but that's just because that's [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6183.56s)]
*  the UFC won't allow that. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6186.16s)]
*  But beating Craig Jones is a gigantic accomplishment. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6187.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah, that guy is elite in terms of people who just train grappling. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6192.280000000001s)]
*  And for him, a guy was training MMA, fighting in the [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6197.8s)]
*  top echelon of the UFC, fighting against some of the best of the best for him [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6202.68s)]
*  to go and beat Craig Jones in a straight up grappling match is that's incredible. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6206.8s)]
*  And look, right. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6211.64s)]
*  So this exactly it is incredible. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6212.280000000001s)]
*  And that's that Phil Rowe. You owe me money. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6214.08s)]
*  He bailed out of a bet he was supposed to, you know, and this was years [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6216.64s)]
*  whenever before I was in the UFC. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6220.16s)]
*  And, you know, I met Phil Rowe playing with Randy Brown on Call of Duty. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6222.52s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Playing Call of Duty. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6225.64s)]
*  That's great. Randy Brown's how I met him. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6227.04s)]
*  I trained with Randy Brown, too. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6228.8s)]
*  But yeah, no, I was so confident in Sean being in that match because, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6230.64s)]
*  like I said, I've gone with Corey Anderson. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6235.400000000001s)]
*  I've gone with some like heavy big dudes and I do well. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6237.400000000001s)]
*  I hold my own. I do I do more than that. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6240.08s)]
*  Right. Like, but [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6241.96s)]
*  man, I've never hit. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6244.4800000000005s)]
*  I've never bro. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6246.0s)]
*  I'm lucky if I take this motherfucker down like once a month. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6246.92s)]
*  I can't do it. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6250.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm going to have a league grappler. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6251.8s)]
*  And you really saw that in the Kelvin Gaston fight. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6254.6s)]
*  Kelvin can wrestle, man. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6256.72s)]
*  And he was all over Kelvin. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, like Kelvin's Kelvin's like a hit or miss, man. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6260.56s)]
*  It's so weird. He it's unfortunate. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6263.400000000001s)]
*  I think Sean, it's just Kelvin should have been a welterweight from the jump. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6265.200000000001s)]
*  He should have been. But did you see the way he was falling? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6269.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6271.68s)]
*  It looked like he just couldn't like [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6272.68s)]
*  he looked like the second Sean like picked him up or like through something. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6274.6s)]
*  He was always so off balance. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6278.320000000001s)]
*  Well, he might be dealing with injuries. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6280.200000000001s)]
*  He's also had a very long career and fucking crazy wars. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6281.72s)]
*  He just had that war with Chris Curtis. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6284.92s)]
*  He's had wars without a sign. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6286.96s)]
*  Good Chris Curtis against Chris Curtis. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6288.6s)]
*  He looked great. Yeah. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6290.16s)]
*  And Chris Curtis is a beast. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6291.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was a good fight. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6293.08s)]
*  And it's just, you know, Kelvin. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6294.44s)]
*  I told Kelvin a long time ago, dude, I go, if you're 170, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6297.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you're a potential world champion. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6300.84s)]
*  But at 85, the difference between a guy like you and a guy like him, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6303.4s)]
*  just the physical frame difference like Adesanya or Paheta [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6306.76s)]
*  or any of these really big 85ers, they're just so much bigger. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6310.84s)]
*  Drekas. Yeah. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6314.5599999999995s)]
*  The difference like Kelvin's my size. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6315.92s)]
*  You're not just fighting talent. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6319.0s)]
*  You know, let's say the skills match. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6320.24s)]
*  Now you're fighting size. You're fighting everything. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6321.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Kelvin is fast as fuck with his hands. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6324.0s)]
*  He's got beautiful fluid combinations with his fist like that one, too. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6327.2s)]
*  They knock Biss being out with. Yeah. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6330.88s)]
*  The motherfucker is amazing. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6332.4400000000005s)]
*  And the fight with Adesanya was a war. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6334.08s)]
*  People forget he had Adesanya in all kinds of trouble. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6336.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's always strike. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6339.76s)]
*  He's his bodybuilders always been so like it's always been so weird to me. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6341.12s)]
*  I mean, he's missed weight so many times and he's [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6345.52s)]
*  he's I don't know, he just never looks like he fully committed. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6348.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's just his genetics, the way he's built. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6352.6s)]
*  But it's like it doesn't look like he's terribly sucked out at 70. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6355.0s)]
*  No, he looks like he went through a cut. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6358.24s)]
*  But like it didn't look like he lost body fat is what you're saying. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6361.52s)]
*  Yeah. The difference between him at 85 and him at 70. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6364.72s)]
*  I feel like he like really fucks off maybe in his diet. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6367.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. There has to be something going on there. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6369.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6372.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he's working with a strict nutritionist. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6373.96s)]
*  It's really got it all dialed. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6376.64s)]
*  Hey, listen, like I told people to him in my post fight, too, like [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6377.6s)]
*  like that was Sean's first time being overseas and whatnot. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6382.56s)]
*  And look, I he knows where he's best, right? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6384.92s)]
*  I'm not saying he's I don't think he can. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6387.92s)]
*  I don't think he's like the best striker in the world by any means. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6389.84s)]
*  But I think he's the best grappler for MMA by a long shot. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6392.240000000001s)]
*  It's not just me, bro. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6396.68s)]
*  This motherfucker could put any of us on our back and you're not getting up. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6398.04s)]
*  You could see when he's grappling. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6401.56s)]
*  It's very high level. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6403.4800000000005s)]
*  Very knows what you're doing. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6404.84s)]
*  He knows where he wants you to go. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6406.28s)]
*  And you think I might get up and then you're stuck. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6407.84s)]
*  And it's like it's very frustrating. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6410.28s)]
*  I hate going with him. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6412.12s)]
*  Well, you could see it in the fights, man. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6413.08s)]
*  You could you know, someone who really appreciates grappling. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6414.92s)]
*  I really love watching that guy fight because it's very high level. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6417.5199999999995s)]
*  And the striking is very good, too. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6420.8s)]
*  You know, the Belal fight [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6422.679999999999s)]
*  sucked for him, but will ultimately be good for him in the long run [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6424.8s)]
*  because it's it's just a painful, horrible lesson. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6428.599999999999s)]
*  Man, I this is what I don't care if he gets mad. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6432.28s)]
*  This is what I'll say. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6436.240000000001s)]
*  I think there was a certain coach that's no longer on our team [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6437.280000000001s)]
*  that I never fucked with that shouldn't have been in his corner [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6440.6s)]
*  and doesn't know how to fucking like, bro, he they didn't. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6443.200000000001s)]
*  He the main the head coach, the guy that was supposed [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6447.56s)]
*  my I say his name. OK. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6451.8s)]
*  He was supposed to run like give him a structure, tell him what to do. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6453.200000000001s)]
*  You know, like he he just kind of like didn't train him [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6457.92s)]
*  and didn't develop a game plan with him like Coach John did everything. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6460.76s)]
*  Coach John is just the striking end of it. Right. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6464.28s)]
*  And obviously, that's where he lost the fight. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6466.48s)]
*  But the dude shot one time. Right. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6468.16s)]
*  You shot one time and that was it. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6470.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, so I think Sean just he had a mental bug. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6471.8s)]
*  And I think Sean's more of like an introvert where he keeps things to himself. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6474.5599999999995s)]
*  And he's very like his private life, his private life. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6477.96s)]
*  And, you know, I can respect that versus me. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6480.04s)]
*  I'm outspoken and I'll say what I'm feeling. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6481.679999999999s)]
*  And I said it the week. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6484.28s)]
*  Bro, I was fucking sad as shit when I thought Abdul. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6485.32s)]
*  I didn't turn it on until I started walking. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6487.639999999999s)]
*  Actually, that's not true. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6490.32s)]
*  I didn't turn it on until I saw him fucking like doing all this like dance and shit. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6491.28s)]
*  Like I was like, you think so? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6495.4s)]
*  And then that's when it turned on. Right. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6497.36s)]
*  But some people just can't turn it on, man. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6498.719999999999s)]
*  And I think that was one of those times where he just wasn't like he was doing good. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6501.12s)]
*  It was a back and forth in the first round. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6506.36s)]
*  And then it just got credit to Bilal. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6507.88s)]
*  Bilal's a big fucking tough dude. You know. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6509.88s)]
*  I'm not a Bilal fan. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6514.599999999999s)]
*  I don't have to give him credit. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6515.719999999999s)]
*  Tough guy, man. Tough guy. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6516.719999999999s)]
*  He beat my teammate. I don't fuck with him. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6518.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I get it. I understand that. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6520.24s)]
*  But no, but he is tough. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6522.4s)]
*  I hope he gets I hope he gets the you know, my feelings for him aside. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6523.719999999999s)]
*  I hope he gets he's how could he not? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6526.92s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6529.2s)]
*  How is it even a discussion that he doesn't get the Leon Edwards? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6530.04s)]
*  I mean, listen, if I was Bilal, I'd be upset, right? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6532.48s)]
*  Like I got poked in the fucking eye. I lost my I lost the fight. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6534.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like, let's run it back. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6537.12s)]
*  Yeah. I don't I don't. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6538.96s)]
*  Oh, like Leon's like like saying he's not going to get it and shit like that. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6541.08s)]
*  It's just weird. What is Leon's like about him not getting it? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6545.5199999999995s)]
*  He doesn't think he deserves it or some shit like that. Really? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6549.040000000001s)]
*  I think that was when he was about to fight Colby. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6551.400000000001s)]
*  Like they were saying, oh, Bilal is going to be next. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6553.360000000001s)]
*  And he was saying like he doesn't deserve it or the only way I could see him [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6555.120000000001s)]
*  saying that is if he thinks of pay-per-view points and that Bilal's not a big sale, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6559.52s)]
*  that he's not going to sell a lot of tickets. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6564.92s)]
*  But who else is next? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6567.200000000001s)]
*  There's no one else there. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6568.88s)]
*  Shavkat. Well, Shavkat. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6569.8s)]
*  But Shavkat needs surgery. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6571.64s)]
*  He went into that fight with Wonder Boy fucked up. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6573.400000000001s)]
*  And that's why I didn't throw any kicks. Yeah. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6575.96s)]
*  And then you have who I think look, everybody's angling to try to get Connor. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6577.64s)]
*  Right. And for a while to wait. Yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6583.64s)]
*  Listen, he's small. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6586.56s)]
*  I understand. But wouldn't you take it just for the money? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6588.08s)]
*  I mean, that's what Leon I feel. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6591.0s)]
*  If I was Leon, Leon would feel like he has a big advantage. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6592.64s)]
*  You know, he's a legitimate Walter way. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6596.12s)]
*  And then he'd make a lot of money. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6598.8s)]
*  It would sell if he could talk Connor into that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6600.320000000001s)]
*  But Connor and Chandler is interesting, too. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6603.0s)]
*  You know that I guess it's actually going to happen. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6605.08s)]
*  So cringing at your weight, which is bananas. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6607.72s)]
*  Listen, that's somebody said something to him about, hey, like we got a no name in me. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6611.280000000001s)]
*  I would fight Connor. You won't fight 85 shit, man. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6616.200000000001s)]
*  Change my life. I'm a fuck you up. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6619.160000000001s)]
*  I will fuck that dude. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6623.320000000001s)]
*  But he's fighting Chandler. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6624.6s)]
*  You know the word, you know, not an 85. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6626.080000000001s)]
*  I'm not used to yet. Joe, the casuals like, oh, are you in Connor's weight class? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6627.92s)]
*  Fucking like what? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6633.0s)]
*  You got to tune out the casuals. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6634.360000000001s)]
*  You have enough conflict in your past. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6635.8s)]
*  So that's what I that's what I struggle with. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6637.96s)]
*  My past, I'm cool with when I it's like I don't think about it. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6640.0s)]
*  Every day comments. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6642.76s)]
*  Sometimes because so I'm like, sometimes not all the time. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6644.64s)]
*  So, bro, it motivates me sometimes. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6649.04s)]
*  Does it really? It does. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6651.24s)]
*  It does. You really need motivation. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6652.4400000000005s)]
*  I always I think I so yeah, I do, because I don't always want to fight at it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6654.72s)]
*  I'm not always I'm not fighting an anger in my past. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6660.08s)]
*  I have that anger because it's just it, bro, it's it. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6662.879999999999s)]
*  I'm bred like that. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6666.28s)]
*  You're also fighting out of ambition. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6667.799999999999s)]
*  I'm fighting out of ambition. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6669.639999999999s)]
*  You know, my biggest drive is, like I said, that dream car, that dream house, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6671.24s)]

*  Yeah, I really believe it. Right. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6694.400000000001s)]
*  I don't read the comments. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6696.16s)]
*  I did almost fight one of the fans. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6698.64s)]
*  I did. I tried. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6700.92s)]
*  I tried to get him to come to the gym. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6702.400000000001s)]
*  I was like, man, this would be great fucking content. Right. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6703.92s)]
*  Like, but then I was like, man, that's corny. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6706.24s)]
*  And I actually think the guy would have followed through. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6708.32s)]
*  He was that fucking stupid. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6710.92s)]
*  There's a lot of dummies. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6712.64s)]
*  There's so many videos of guys showing up at gyms and online [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6713.72s)]
*  Internet trolls getting head kicked. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6718.12s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6719.56s)]
*  I just watched some recent one with some guy went into a Muay Thai gym [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6720.72s)]
*  and the dude hit him with a leg kick and then fucking shinned him in the head. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6724.240000000001s)]
*  Can you? Oh, yeah. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6728.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, he brutalized him with a leg kick. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6729.92s)]
*  And then the guy didn't move right. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6732.4800000000005s)]
*  And then step back. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6733.84s)]
*  Boom. Head kick and flatlined him. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6735.280000000001s)]
*  That's some dumbass. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6737.92s)]
*  And that's all right. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6739.16s)]
*  Like that's like on that subject. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6740.04s)]
*  That's hard. Right. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6741.88s)]
*  Like I'll read the comments sometimes because I'm petty. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6742.56s)]
*  Like I went back after I beat Abdul and I was like, yeah, talk that shit now. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6744.96s)]
*  Like, say something. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6749.36s)]
*  You know, just to those few, I saved three particular comments. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6750.639999999999s)]
*  I did. And I went back. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6754.84s)]
*  I went back. Joe, that's so crazy. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6758.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm an elephant, bro. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6759.92s)]
*  When you get it, you don't forget. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6762.2s)]
*  So but nothing you get taught to deal with, right, is. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6764.36s)]
*  What to say, what not to say, people always give their opinion, [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6769.2s)]
*  like even before coming on here, don't talk about a certain thing [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6771.92s)]
*  because I have my beliefs, right. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6774.599999999999s)]
*  So we stay in a safe space. We can talk about it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6775.96s)]
*  There's plenty of people telling you not to talk about. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6777.8s)]
*  Well, you don't talk about politics. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6780.360000000001s)]
*  You don't talk about people's parents. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6781.84s)]
*  You don't talk about religion, shit like that. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6783.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6784.96s)]
*  I would say don't talk about other people's parents. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6785.52s)]
*  That's a good one. Yeah. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6787.400000000001s)]
*  But politics and religion, that's just a part of life. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6788.4400000000005s)]
*  Anybody says you shouldn't talk about if I get if I get. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6791.04s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, though, if I give my political view on this, [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6793.320000000001s)]
*  it's like it opens up a door, not, you know, you'll get a lot of new [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6796.56s)]
*  like people, but it opens up the door for all these other wide. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6800.92s)]
*  It's such a diverse, like such a controversial argument. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6803.360000000001s)]
*  It's like I have this conversation with you off camera all day long. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6806.32s)]
*  I got my beliefs. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6810.12s)]
*  I think you know where I'm at. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6811.0s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, I mean, it's just certain things you don't. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6811.96s)]
*  Well, this is a very divided country, more so than I'm 56. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6815.679999999999s)]
*  And never in my life have I seen this country. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6819.799999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. That's crazy. Never. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6821.88s)]
*  You look like you fucking figured out how to reverse time, man. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6824.36s)]
*  You talk about me being big. You fucking wider than me. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6827.799999999999s)]
*  I stay healthy. Yeah. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6830.04s)]
*  TRT and a lot of vitamins. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6831.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm always doing something. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6834.04s)]
*  I'm very active in taking care of my body. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6835.64s)]
*  You wish you fought? No, no. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6838.68s)]
*  I wish you had a fight. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6841.4400000000005s)]
*  I had kickboxing fights, had three kickboxing fights, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6842.88s)]
*  and I had about 100 taekwondo fights. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6845.8s)]
*  And I had seen your fortune in that kick, bro. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6848.240000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to stay out of range on that. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6851.68s)]
*  I unfortunately also came up in a gym that didn't spar smart. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6854.240000000001s)]
*  We spart hard. We fought. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6860.56s)]
*  It was like a lot of knockouts. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6862.360000000001s)]
*  When did you start? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6864.12s)]
*  I started martial arts when I was 15. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6865.5599999999995s)]
*  That's when I started serious. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6867.68s)]
*  I took a little bit of it before. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6868.84s)]
*  I took karate when I was 14. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6870.88s)]
*  I fucked around a little bit before that. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6872.84s)]
*  But when I was 15, I became obsessed and, you know, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6874.48s)]
*  just wasn't really good at anything other than art. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6877.8s)]
*  I was a good I was a good artist. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6880.5199999999995s)]
*  But it was nothing that really made me feel like I was a special person [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6882.5199999999995s)]
*  until I started doing martial arts. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6886.24s)]
*  Then when I started winning and I became obsessed, I was training every day. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6887.5199999999995s)]
*  And I started getting really good winning tournaments. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6891.5599999999995s)]
*  And then I realized, oh, I'm not a loser. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6893.96s)]
*  I just never figured out what to do. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6898.08s)]
*  And now I found a thing to do. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6901.4s)]
*  And I know that if I just work hard, I can be exceptional [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6903.56s)]
*  and I can get better at it. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6906.96s)]
*  But I was also when I was making the transition into kickboxing, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6908.52s)]
*  there was first of all, there's no money. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6912.2s)]
*  This is we're talking 1988. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6913.96s)]
*  There's no money in it. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6915.52s)]
*  And there's no money in kickboxing. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6916.8s)]
*  I wasn't a good boxer. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6918.72s)]
*  I didn't have a lot of boxing experience. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6919.8s)]
*  And some of the guys that I was training with were going into boxing, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6921.88s)]
*  particularly this one kid, Dana Rosenblatt, who went on to be the New [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6924.76s)]
*  England Middleweight champion. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6927.96s)]
*  He beat Vinny Pazienza. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6929.68s)]
*  He beat Howard Davis Jr. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6931.2s)]
*  Who's the guy that ends up for Roy Jones? Yes. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6932.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He was the only guy. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6935.400000000001s)]
*  A neck. Yeah. Well, he did. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6936.4800000000005s)]
*  He broke his neck in a car accident. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6938.28s)]
*  But when I was watching those guys, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6940.08s)]
*  one of the things I was seeing was brain damage. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6943.72s)]
*  I was seeing guys where I knew him from five years ago and then I know him now. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6945.88s)]
*  And I was noticing slurring a slowness to the way they were thinking. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6949.16s)]
*  And, you know, I was just seeing people didn't just spar. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6954.92s)]
*  They fought in the gym. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6959.88s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of that from the early days of MMA as well. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6961.96s)]
*  You know, particularly shoot the box. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6965.32s)]
*  Those guys just beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6967.2s)]
*  Like the old militich fighters, those guys beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6969.639999999999s)]
*  There was a lot of camps where the amount of damage. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6973.92s)]
*  Like I've talked to Shob about this, too, about him training with like Shane [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6977.6s)]
*  Carwin and those guys back in the day in Denver. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6980.6s)]
*  They beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6984.160000000001s)]
*  And the damage that you take in the gym, that shit counts. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6986.160000000001s)]
*  It's it's real. Yeah. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6990.400000000001s)]
*  And in that way, I'm glad I didn't because I started seeing. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6992.0s)]
*  I you know, I was a lot of headaches and that kind of shit early on. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=6996.88s)]
*  And I was like, and there was no future. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7001.64s)]
*  I didn't have a future in fighting. There was no it didn't exist. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7003.52s)]
*  So when the UFC came along, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7006.96s)]
*  which was 1993, I'd already stopped fighting. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7009.799999999999s)]
*  I was already doing standup comedy. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7012.719999999999s)]
*  But I was like, oh, they figured it out. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7014.48s)]
*  This is it. Somebody figured it out. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7016.879999999999s)]
*  Because back then it was always like, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7018.719999999999s)]
*  how do you make a living as a martial artist if you want to compete? [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7021.44s)]
*  There's no money. You have to open up a school. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7024.36s)]
*  The only thing you could do is teach at a school and then compete in tournaments. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7026.599999999999s)]
*  And there's no money in the tournaments. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7030.04s)]
*  But then when the UFC came along, also, we realized like how much of what [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7031.639999999999s)]
*  people were doing was nonsense, how much of what people were doing was wasted time. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7036.12s)]
*  So that's how it was when Eddie was coming up. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7040.2s)]
*  It was like bar room brawl type fucking training. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7041.96s)]
*  Yeah. And that's that's how I grew up when I seen it. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7045.4s)]
*  And then my dad used to be put me at 12 years old against 16 year olds. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7047.8s)]
*  And I remember I fucking thought my head was bleeding. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7051.8s)]
*  I'm sure. And probably was. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7054.0s)]
*  You know, that that kind of training, it teaches you how to be tough [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7056.64s)]
*  and how to deal with like a real fight. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7061.16s)]
*  And you definitely get more comfortable with really throwing. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7063.48s)]
*  But the consequences of those shots that you receive in training are legitimate. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7066.4s)]
*  You know, Jerry Quarry, you know, is a famous boxer, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7071.04s)]
*  fought Muhammad Ali back in the day. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7074.32s)]
*  Just a crazy, tough dude who just walked forward and just ate punches and took a beating. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7077.08s)]
*  Just a tough, tough dude. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7082.28s)]
*  Well, he had a bunch of fights. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7084.0s)]
*  And at the end of his life, he was a vegetable. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7085.28s)]
*  He was just gone. Yeah. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7087.839999999999s)]
*  Well, his brother only had like one pro fight. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7089.5599999999995s)]
*  I think. And his brother never had a pro career. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7093.04s)]
*  His brother was just as fucked up as he was at the end of his life. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7096.08s)]
*  And it was all from the gym, all from just gym wars. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7099.200000000001s)]
*  You know, I was watching this video last night on Wilfred Benitez. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7102.6s)]
*  And they were talking about Wilfredo Benitez [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7107.56s)]
*  during his day was just an insanely slick boxer. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7111.0s)]
*  You know, turned pro when he was 17, was a world champion. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7115.08s)]
*  Shortly after that was his incredible defensive boxer out of Puerto Rico. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7119.48s)]
*  And at the end of his life, man, where he is now, like he's bed ridden. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7124.08s)]
*  He's a vegetable, basically. That's him now. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7129.32s)]
*  I mean, it's so hard to see him. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7131.92s)]
*  Yeah, I heard last Friday, Wilfred Benitez, the pride of Puerto Rico, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7135.32s)]
*  the alien boxing grays now fully depend on his sister watches over him. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7139.16s)]
*  Their humble apartment. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7142.72s)]
*  So that's exactly another reason, right? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7144.48s)]
*  Like when you want to talk about what we were talking about, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7146.2s)]
*  I mean, going 200 mile an hour. Yeah, I could go into like that shit. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7148.24s)]
*  I don't like reading that stuff because that sits in the back of my mind, too. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7152.04s)]
*  I don't want to be a fucking vegetable. Of course. Right. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7155.92s)]
*  But I'm not and I'm not knocking our pay, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7158.0s)]
*  but we don't make what any other professional athlete makes. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7162.2s)]
*  Well, you do at the high end at the high end. Right. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7166.84s)]
*  But, you know, I'm three fights in and I'm fortunate to be getting the main event. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7169.88s)]
*  Man, I I don't know, but I I was told that there's only one other person [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7174.0s)]
*  that's done that in my division. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7179.12s)]
*  And I don't know who it is. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7181.56s)]
*  And I want to know who it is. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7183.56s)]
*  I don't know. But obviously, there's a shit ton of hype on you. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7184.76s)]
*  You know, you've got a lot of a lot of great hype on you, which is which, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7187.96s)]
*  you know, is crazy, doesn't do anything to me. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7191.72s)]
*  Like, I don't feel like I think DC didn't believe me at first when I was [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7194.44s)]
*  I made my debut when I got in the UFC, the weight on my shoulders dropped. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7198.56s)]
*  Now, there's another weight that comes on, right? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7202.639999999999s)]
*  The expectation and things like that that I hold myself to. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7204.24s)]
*  But I'm like, man, like, I don't give a fuck if there's a thousand people, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7207.16s)]
*  if there's zero people, if there's 50,000 people, it doesn't faze me. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7210.759999999999s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7215.839999999999s)]
*  I'm so like locked in on your face. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7216.839999999999s)]
*  Like, that's that's why I want like you, motherfucker. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7218.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you are the second half of my paycheck. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7221.799999999999s)]
*  I'm coming for you. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7224.5199999999995s)]
*  Like and I think sometimes that's where you have really talented guys [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7225.36s)]
*  that don't know how to get past the lights and cameras. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7230.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a big moment. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7234.08s)]
*  It's a you see it all the time. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7235.36s)]
*  You got to show it to them. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7236.96s)]
*  They make that UFC debut. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7237.679999999999s)]
*  Some guys just rise to the occasion and you see them better than they've ever [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7239.84s)]
*  been before in the UFC debut because they belong to their champions. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7243.0s)]
*  They just have to. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7246.04s)]
*  And then there's other guys that get dwarfed by the moment. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7247.04s)]
*  The moment hits them and they're just, whoo. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7249.08s)]
*  Well, you know, it's crazy is like the moment hits you like it's a weird feeling [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7251.2s)]
*  when it's so different. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7255.639999999999s)]
*  Even for me, sitting as a fan watching. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7258.92s)]
*  Like you don't realize what that person's going through. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7262.12s)]
*  We walk out and it's like a cold sweat because it's a fucking big ass building [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7265.04s)]
*  like AC. It's like that cold sweat, but you're kind of hot. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7268.679999999999s)]
*  And then you fucking realize when you're in there, it's like everything's like [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7271.84s)]
*  so amplified and you're like, fuck man, like I'm about to get into a fistfight. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7275.04s)]
*  Yeah. But then that's where you make that decision. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7279.4s)]
*  Like once that finally hit your brain, which we all have it, it's like you [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7281.92s)]
*  either can hone in on what you're about to do or you can hone in on the fact [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7285.04s)]
*  that like you don't feel like being there. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7288.68s)]
*  Right. And one of the things that I've come to terms with is I think that changed [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7290.4s)]
*  my trajectory of my career and the way I fought, because if you watch my early [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7294.12s)]
*  fights, like I would just go out there and try to like blitz and get out of there [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7298.24s)]
*  and like, fuck you up and knock you out and get out. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7301.48s)]
*  Like that's what I wanted to do. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7303.76s)]
*  I don't look I don't force trying to knock people out. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7305.32s)]
*  I don't force the finish. I don't. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7307.6s)]
*  I just try to wear and then catch you. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7309.56s)]
*  I know I need one. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7311.68s)]
*  In my head, I'm convinced you could be Francis Ngannou. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7312.84s)]
*  I think I need one. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7316.400000000001s)]
*  That's I wholeheartedly believe that I don't. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7317.68s)]
*  And then you got the other aspect of fighters that convince themselves, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7321.4400000000005s)]
*  oh, I can knock somebody out. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7324.68s)]
*  But you just don't truly believe it's different. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7326.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a difference between coaching yourself to believe it [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7328.84s)]
*  and actually fucking believing it. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7331.16s)]
*  Well, you have extraordinary power, you know, and what I was saying [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7332.64s)]
*  about the Rizak Al-Assad fight is that you showed another level of poise [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7336.16s)]
*  in that fight. It was another level of technique. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7341.92s)]
*  It was another level of like this again. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7344.56s)]
*  It's like it's very difficult for a fighter to express themselves at. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7346.56s)]
*  You know, when a guy's on in the gym and just go, motherfucker, look at that, dude. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7351.04s)]
*  They just sometimes guys just look like they're on fire. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7354.96s)]
*  They're timing their everything. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7358.320000000001s)]
*  Look at your world be. You're like, who could beat that? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7359.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. Who could beat that? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7361.280000000001s)]
*  And then it's very difficult to express that inside the octagon. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7362.8s)]
*  So when you hear a lot of great things about fighters and then you see a performance, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7366.8s)]
*  you got to go, OK, they got to get over the anxiety. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7370.679999999999s)]
*  They got to get over the pressure. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7373.36s)]
*  They got to get over the experience boundary because you do need [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7374.639999999999s)]
*  experience in front of different styles, no matter what, [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7379.0s)]
*  no matter how well you train and how good your training partners are. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7381.84s)]
*  You need live experience against really talented fighters [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7384.759999999999s)]
*  to really develop your full potential. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7388.36s)]
*  And in the the Rizak fight, I saw it with you. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7390.5599999999995s)]
*  I was like, OK, he had another he had another level. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7393.84s)]
*  Yeah, I wish I wish. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7396.5599999999995s)]
*  I was that was a tough fight. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7399.52s)]
*  It was it was it was a scary fight to take because he was tactically behind me [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7401.68s)]
*  and he had all knockouts. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7405.88s)]
*  Right. You know, so that's there's that in the back of your head. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7408.040000000001s)]
*  There's that fear like, oh, shit, like he can clip anybody. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7410.6s)]
*  He can clip anybody. Right. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7413.280000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I and at the in the same token, I just kept it very small. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7414.320000000001s)]
*  Like I didn't buy into that. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7418.200000000001s)]
*  It was like, bro, you're a middleweight short guy [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7419.4800000000005s)]
*  that is coming up to a weight you don't belong. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7421.88s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7423.84s)]
*  Do you think that he should be 170? 100 percent. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7424.84s)]
*  Yeah, he does not belong 185. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7426.96s)]
*  And he doesn't he's not the leanest guy that one is a thick spark plug. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7428.88s)]
*  Bill, yeah, type style is a fire hydrant. Right. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7433.04s)]
*  Like he he is a big man at 170. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7435.400000000001s)]
*  I just think he's lazy. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7441.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that's that's my opinion, because, yeah, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7443.280000000001s)]
*  the fact that I took you down that easy, the fact that I kept you down that easy. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7446.64s)]
*  But I put that joke in pretty basic and I felt him will. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7449.6s)]
*  I think the slam really was like, what the fuck? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7452.88s)]
*  Mm hmm. And then he got slammed again. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7455.04s)]
*  There's such a difference in size. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7457.679999999999s)]
*  There's such a difference inside. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7459.28s)]
*  And I've advocated many times for multiple weight classes. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7460.44s)]
*  I think I think the jump between 70 and 85 is too high. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7463.679999999999s)]
*  And I think the jump between 85 and 205 is way too high. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7467.2s)]
*  Twenty pounds is so big. It is. It is. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7470.32s)]
*  So there's so I mean, obviously, Paheta pulls it off. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7473.32s)]
*  But he's 95. Sweet ass. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7476.2s)]
*  Sweet. I think I think you get the perfect you get the height. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7478.8s)]
*  So I it's funny, every fighter will contest the set at their divisions the best. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7482.92s)]
*  But I think the the perfect athlete is my size. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7487.16s)]
*  The height, the power, the power, right. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7491.5599999999995s)]
*  The explosiveness. Everything. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7494.599999999999s)]
*  If you can. I think I do. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7496.5199999999995s)]
*  I like a Joel Romero like that. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7498.68s)]
*  That you get a taller guy. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7500.76s)]
*  I mean, he's not the tallest, right. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7502.68s)]
*  But you get even a Paul Acosta. Right. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7503.76s)]
*  You look at their breath. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7505.84s)]
*  Like, I think that's the perfect mix between a not too tall, just the right height. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7506.639999999999s)]
*  Big explosive, high volume, high body weights. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7510.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Like still crazy knockout power. Yeah. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7514.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But that but that's just me. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7516.88s)]
*  No, I see that argument. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7519.4800000000005s)]
*  Eighty five is obviously a very deep division, too, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7520.76s)]
*  because there's a big size difference between 70 and 85. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7523.84s)]
*  It's a big difference, which is the Kelvin argument. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7526.84s)]
*  Like, you know, but then when Calvin went down to 170 and but Sean's a big one. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7529.360000000001s)]

*  Yeah. You know, you can see that's that's that's exactly it. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7552.4s)]

*  He's like a snake charmer. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7733.8s)]
*  Like he knows how to put it on you. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7735.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, the Johnny Walker one, like when everybody said that Jamal doesn't hit hard. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7737.92s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7741.08s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7743.36s)]
*  That is the weirdest fucking knockout I've ever seen. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7744.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought he was fucking I thought he but he went he went. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7746.84s)]
*  Yeah, he like bent forward and then flew back. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7749.4s)]
*  And I was like, I've never seen some dumb shit like that ever. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7751.5599999999995s)]
*  Johnny has been knocked out a lot. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7754.32s)]
*  And the thing is, like when a guy gets knocked out a lot, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7756.4s)]
*  it's like you got to wonder how much he's got his nose broken. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7759.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. How much and Goliath was a bad man. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7762.92s)]
*  That's a thick dude. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7765.4s)]
*  That's what I was talking about when I was saying, like, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7766.88s)]
*  oh, you got different bone density. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7768.8s)]
*  He's like, that's a thick guy. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7770.08s)]
*  Well, then you got to think of Jan Bojovic. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7771.32s)]
*  Jan Bojovic went shin to shin with that dude and fucked his legs up. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7774.599999999999s)]
*  Like Jan Bojovic is made out of rocks. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7778.5199999999995s)]
*  Like that fucking dude. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7780.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's another one like SpongeBob SquarePants. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7782.08s)]
*  When Adesanya went up to 205, like that guy was too big. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7784.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's too big. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7788.32s)]
*  That's a giant jump, man. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7789.679999999999s)]
*  That's a giant thing as he comes back 2027 or sooner. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7791.599999999999s)]
*  You know, I think sooner. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7795.28s)]
*  I think sooner. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7796.599999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, you say things like that because your body's beat up. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7798.12s)]
*  He went through so many camps in a row. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7801.28s)]
*  He defended his title more than any other champion. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7803.639999999999s)]
*  So active, so active. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7805.8s)]
*  You're going to get and then [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7808.5199999999995s)]
*  I fucking think he just didn't. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7810.5199999999995s)]
*  I think he slept on Sean. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7812.679999999999s)]
*  I think he burnt out. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7814.04s)]
*  I think it was a little bit of that. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7815.08s)]
*  But also think I think he thought Sean wasn't on his level. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7816.24s)]
*  I thought I think a lot of people say it's him up the way he did [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7819.719999999999s)]
*  with Paulo Costa, that he was just going to go piece him up. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7822.719999999999s)]
*  But Sean is so hard to hit. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7825.48s)]
*  He saw, you know, they did that thing with the UFC, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7828.799999999999s)]
*  where I think it's a mouthpiece where it registers how many times you get hit. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7831.16s)]
*  Sean spars more than anybody and he gets hit less than anybody, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7834.5599999999995s)]
*  which is pretty extraordinary. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7838.32s)]
*  That style is very sneaky. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7839.679999999999s)]
*  You know, and it's just the Philly shell. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7842.12s)]
*  I don't do it the same way he does, but it's weird to see someone do it in MMA. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7844.4s)]
*  He's no one else does it. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7848.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And he walked. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7849.759999999999s)]
*  It doesn't. It just looks odd. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7851.12s)]
*  Well, he also doesn't get. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7852.96s)]
*  So I think that's that's kind of like a part of his defense. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7856.24s)]
*  Like a lot of people that do the Philly show like me, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7859.2s)]
*  sometimes I'll dip into a certain side. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7862.48s)]
*  And it's like he just kind of stands straight and leans and puts his arms out. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7864.4s)]
*  Yeah. The problem with dipping with kicks is like your face off. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7868.96s)]
*  Yeah. You zig when you should have zagged and that shins coming at you. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7873.24s)]
*  And this, you know, I mean, it's there's so many fucking good fights [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7876.639999999999s)]
*  to be had right now. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7881.08s)]
*  There's so many good fights that are coming up. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7882.16s)]
*  You know, one I'm really fucking excited about is Volkanovsky versus Ilya Toporya. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7883.72s)]
*  Ilya's I like watching the box, bro. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7888.360000000001s)]
*  That's a bad man. He hunts the body. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7891.360000000001s)]
*  He's a he's a bad man. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7893.4800000000005s)]
*  And he's a tough and he's a guy that knows how to take it, too. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7894.96s)]
*  If you watch that Jai Herbert fight where he got caught, he got kicked bad. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7897.400000000001s)]
*  He still came back. Yeah. And that's a 55 to I do think he's a 45. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7901.6s)]
*  I do think I do. I do. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7905.84s)]
*  Yeah, we have like me and Sean do like a little little tiny [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7907.4400000000005s)]
*  like podcast on picking fights and this. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7911.08s)]
*  This is a situation I wanted to talk to you about this [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7913.2s)]
*  because there's a lot of different philosophies on this. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7915.24s)]
*  I understand why Usman took that last minute fight against Hansa. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7917.96s)]
*  And I understand why Volkanovsky took that last minute fight against Makachev. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7923.24s)]
*  And as a fan, when I was at home and they announced that the change, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7928.04s)]
*  those changes, I was like, oh, shit. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7931.88s)]
*  But the reality is you need a camp. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7935.04s)]
*  You are not the same guy with 10 days notice as you are with 10 weeks notice. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7938.679999999999s)]
*  You are just not the same guy. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7944.16s)]
*  And when you look at the Volkanovsky that fought Makachev the first time, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7946.919999999999s)]
*  that was a guy who went through a full fucking camp and was a plus rip, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7950.5599999999995s)]
*  ready to go full gas tank. Let's fucking go. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7955.2s)]
*  The guy let alone what it does for you mentally. Yes. Yes. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7958.759999999999s)]
*  You have to go through that suffering to know that you were built strong enough [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7963.16s)]
*  to withstand what you're about to go through. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7966.84s)]
*  And I won't take no fucking short notice. I'll die. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7968.92s)]
*  I don't think you should either. I really don't think anyone should, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7971.96s)]
*  even though I like them when they make them. I'm a hypocrite. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7975.04s)]
*  I won't do it because as a fan, I'm like, oh, I can't wait to see this. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7977.64s)]
*  You could be a hypocrite as long as you're being a fan. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7980.4400000000005s)]
*  If I was in Usman's corner, if Kamara was my friend and I'd say, don't do it. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7983.08s)]
*  Don't do it. I think you beat that guy with a camp. Yeah. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7987.96s)]
*  I mean, even at 85, I think you beat that guy. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7990.6s)]
*  Because if you look at the third round, he was coming on strong. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7992.92s)]
*  Yeah, it comes. That was done. And he didn't have a camp at all. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7995.28s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's a difference, a giant difference. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=7998.639999999999s)]
*  It's not like a five percent difference. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8003.12s)]
*  I think it's like a 25 percent difference. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8004.719999999999s)]
*  Probably even more than that. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8006.719999999999s)]
*  And when you look at Makachev, first of all, Makachev is a fucking monster. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8007.84s)]
*  He's a monster. You do not want to fight that guy when he's gone through a full camp [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8011.679999999999s)]
*  in Dagestan, rip ready to go. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8015.599999999999s)]
*  And he had adjusted to Volkanovsky style. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8018.32s)]
*  He had a completely good solution. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8021.04s)]
*  He had a perfect solution. The kicks to the body. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8023.84s)]
*  He was throwing those kicks to the body, set up that head kick. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8026.52s)]
*  He took away Volkanovsky's leg kicks from the outside. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8029.08s)]
*  He took away all the shit that Volkanovsky was doing to him [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8032.04s)]
*  that was troubling him in the first fight. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8034.4400000000005s)]
*  And he imposed his will on him. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8035.88s)]
*  But that's often the problem, right? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8037.04s)]
*  You go, you take a short notice fight. Sure. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8038.4400000000005s)]
*  Now everybody will sit here and say, man, that guy's got balls. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8040.280000000001s)]
*  And then that rides off into the sunset. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8043.360000000001s)]
*  And that's all you got for you. Or you get Aspinall. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8045.0s)]
*  Tom Aspinall wins the title on short minutes, short short notice fight [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8047.68s)]
*  and couldn't even spar. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8051.36s)]
*  His rib was all fucked up. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8053.0s)]
*  He couldn't even train, couldn't wrestle. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8054.32s)]
*  And he's fighting Sergey, who's a monster. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8056.24s)]
*  He's a monster. But I think they blew him up. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8058.5199999999995s)]
*  They blew Sergey up. They blew him up. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8060.799999999999s)]
*  Well, because they needed the next crazy punching power guy. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8062.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, he does have that. He definitely does. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8066.759999999999s)]
*  But you also have to look at the Alistair Overeem fight. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8068.5199999999995s)]
*  We all knew he had like, yeah. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8071.12s)]
*  I mean, honestly, Alistair, yes, Alistair did and exposed his wrestling [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8072.5599999999995s)]
*  and things like that. But I mean, Alistair is the guy. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8076.88s)]
*  That's the steroid argument. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8080.28s)]
*  That's the guy. Yeah, that's the guy for legalizing steroids. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8082.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a fucking. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8085.5199999999995s)]
*  I remember I remember I was so excited. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8087.2s)]
*  We couldn't afford to fucking buy it. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8089.92s)]
*  But I was like when him and Brock Lesnar fought. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8091.44s)]
*  And I was like, man, I just remember like the hype video. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8094.639999999999s)]
*  And I was like, you know, these are two fucking giants. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8097.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, it's huge. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8099.12s)]
*  But then again, Brock probably shouldn't have taken that fight either [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8101.0s)]
*  because Brock was just a few months out of diverticulitis surgery [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8103.08s)]
*  where he had to get a length of his colon or his intestine removed. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8106.52s)]
*  I mean, thank God, man, I've never had anything in the body like that. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8111.120000000001s)]
*  From Alistair, who's a K-1 Grand Prix champion [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8114.8s)]
*  and juice to the tits at two sixty. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8119.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Alistair was. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8122.52s)]
*  Do you think that do you? [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8124.96s)]
*  He was fucking huge, man. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8126.88s)]
*  Do you think that the heavyweight? [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8129.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think the heavyweight limit should be 285? [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8132.96s)]
*  No, I don't think there should be a limit. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8135.4s)]
*  I don't either. I don't think it makes any sense. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8137.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't have a super heavyweight class. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8139.2s)]
*  I say anything above three thirty is too much. Why? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8140.679999999999s)]
*  Let him fight because then you're going to get some fat motherfucker that ain't. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8143.719999999999s)]
*  So let that guy get a single punch. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8146.84s)]
*  Let that guy get fucked up. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8148.639999999999s)]
*  And that's fair enough. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8149.719999999999s)]
*  But I don't think you should cut weight. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8150.92s)]
*  I think you should be like a heavyweight in boxing. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8153.12s)]
*  Like when Andy Ruiz fought Joshua terrible in the second fight, he was so fat. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8155.44s)]
*  He's 280 pounds. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8161.639999999999s)]
*  But that's just what you are. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8163.24s)]
*  That's it. This is heavyweight. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8165.5199999999995s)]
*  Heavyweight is heavyweight. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8167.36s)]
*  This idea of a super heavyweight class, we've never utilized it. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8168.32s)]
*  There is a weight class above 265. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8171.4s)]
*  Why do you think there's nobody there? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8173.76s)]
*  Who's there? [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8177.44s)]
*  I don't know. Like Francis, even like a one ninety five or one seventy five. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8177.96s)]
*  I don't know. They don't listen to me. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8181.92s)]
*  Listen, if it was me, I would do two things very, very early on. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8185.0s)]
*  If it was my decision and it would fucking throw everything into chaos, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8190.12s)]
*  but ultimately be better for the sport. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8194.48s)]
*  Number one thing I would do is more weight classes. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8196.44s)]
*  I would say minimum every 10 pounds. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8199.76s)]
*  I agree with that. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8203.64s)]
*  I had the lighter weight classes. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8204.48s)]
*  You could go five pounds. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8206.039999999999s)]
*  Look at what boxing does. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8207.48s)]
*  Boxing is, you know, one twenty six, one thirty, one thirty five. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8209.08s)]
*  They go. I think it would be the cleanest [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8213.44s)]
*  or organization to have every 10 pounds. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8216.12s)]
*  10 pounds. But without like boxing, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8219.56s)]
*  there's four different fucking belts at each weight class. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8221.92s)]
*  Right. Whatever it is. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8223.96s)]
*  Well, there is kind of with the UFC, you know, I mean, people respect. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8224.68s)]
*  Obviously, Jody Eblen is like one of the best middleweights on the planet Earth [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8227.8s)]
*  without a doubt. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8232.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, he's fighting a bellator and the casual has no idea [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8233.56s)]
*  who he is with the guy's a monster. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8237.279999999999s)]
*  And then he just got announced to fight Impa. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8239.32s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8243.96s)]
*  Yeah, me and him. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8244.56s)]
*  He was me and Impa fought in the same contender series when I broke my arm. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8245.32s)]
*  He won. I like Impa. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8248.2s)]
*  Impa is a great guy. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8249.52s)]
*  And unfortunately, he's at the wrong end of that highlight kick from Joaquin. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8250.52s)]
*  Joaquin Buckley hit him with one of the craziest kicks of all time. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8256.36s)]
*  That jump spinning back kick while he was holding his left leg. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8259.48s)]
*  That was wild. Yeah, that was wild. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8261.8s)]
*  And Joaquin is another one. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8264.039999999999s)]
*  That dude at 170 is a fucking problem. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8266.36s)]
*  He's a guy who is he was a big muscular guy [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8270.36s)]
*  who decided to fight at 85 and was beating a lot of guys at 85 [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8273.72s)]
*  because he's so powerful. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8277.84s)]
*  But you see him at 170, his gas tank is crazy. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8278.84s)]
*  His skills look like he's on another level. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8282.44s)]
*  I know he was salty. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8284.8s)]
*  I told him in the back before I beat Abdul. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8285.76s)]
*  I'm going to take that bonus from you. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8287.56s)]
*  They were talking shit on me when I walked in the fucking P.I. though. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8290.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8293.6s)]
*  But me and Buckley are cool. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8294.56s)]
*  But I love Buckley. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8296.04s)]
*  He was like, man, beat Joe Pfeiffer. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8297.24s)]
*  And Abdul was like, man, fuck Joe Pfeiffer. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8298.880000000001s)]
*  I was like, ah, that's how you feel. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8301.32s)]
*  But yeah, it was funny. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8304.68s)]
*  Well, Joaquin is funny. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8305.92s)]
*  Joaquin at 170 is a real force. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8306.84s)]
*  He's a real force. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8309.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think as he moves up in the rankings at 170, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8310.28s)]
*  I think that's his real weight class. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8313.76s)]
*  So here's the thing, though, when I look at a guy like Buckley [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8315.12s)]
*  and he, you know, hopefully watches this or he doesn't watch this and get offended. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8317.2s)]
*  But how does he fare against somebody like [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8320.48s)]
*  like you still got Kevin Holland who whooped him. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8325.28s)]
*  He did. He whooped him at 185. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8327.880000000001s)]
*  You got it. But I think the in all fairness, I think Joaquin is a way better fight. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8329.8s)]
*  He's a way better fighter now at 170. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8335.2s)]
*  Now, look, you get better. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8337.6s)]
*  You keep the dude is driven as fuck. Yeah, he's constantly training. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8339.36s)]
*  He's getting better. Everybody gets better. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8342.32s)]
*  Or they don't. And when they don't, you see that, too. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8344.32s)]
*  You see those guys like a guy like Jeff Neal. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8347.04s)]
*  I think that I like Jeff Neal. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8350.36s)]
*  Well, do Jeff Neal is another guy. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8352.32s)]
*  Go back and watch his Balal Mohammed fight. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8353.72s)]
*  He pissed up Balal back in the day. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8355.4s)]
*  Jeff Neal was the dark horse when he knocked out Mike Perry, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8357.28s)]
*  when he hit him with that head kick. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8360.04s)]
*  Jeff Neal is a motherfucker when I think he's the one that put [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8361.4s)]
*  Mike Perry's fucking nose on the other side. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8364.4s)]
*  I thought it was too. But Mike corrected me online. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8366.279999999999s)]
*  It was Vicente Luque Vicente Luque did that. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8369.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8372.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Mike Perry at bare knuckle boxing is one of the fucking [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8373.84s)]
*  dangerous human beings ever. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8378.08s)]
*  He's specifically designed for bare knuckle fighting. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8380.32s)]
*  That guy is, you know, it's funny, uniquely qualified to brag. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8384.199999999999s)]
*  Lorenzo Hunt, you know. Yeah. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8387.52s)]
*  I beat him. Did you? Choked him unconscious. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8389.52s)]
*  In the MMA fight? Yeah, my third or fourth pro fight. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8391.76s)]
*  Ah, man, that's somebody's kid. That's somebody's kid. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8394.64s)]
*  And I choked him. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8398.16s)]
*  I didn't throw a single fucking punch. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8400.68s)]
*  He came out, threw a wild right head, took him down, choked him out. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8402.08s)]
*  He's a very good bare knuckle boxer. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8405.04s)]
*  That was my first introduction because I was still kind of undersized at middle weight. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8406.92s)]
*  He was my first introduction to like an old head that was like 33, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8410.36s)]
*  34 that had like fucking grown man strength. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8414.64s)]
*  You see that motherfucker's head? His shit's like this fucking big. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8417.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's stout. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8420.28s)]
*  He's I don't know. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8422.480000000001s)]
*  Fighting is not getting the respect that it deserves. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8424.08s)]
*  You know, I think it's too brutal for the common people. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8427.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8429.640000000001s)]
*  You're probably right. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8431.44s)]
*  But I'm a big fan of the juggernaut. He's a beast. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8432.560000000001s)]
*  I love watching those guys, too. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8436.12s)]
*  It's just because it's such a hard way to do it. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8437.6s)]
*  It's such a hard way to do it. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8439.84s)]
*  I mean, bare knuckle boxing is fucking rough. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8441.720000000001s)]
*  You see when Rockhold quit, when Mike Perry blasted his teeth out, he's like, that's it. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8444.28s)]
*  Bro, honestly, Rockhold is the biggest disappointment to me. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8448.32s)]
*  I used to be one of my favorite fighters and he's just like, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8451.0s)]
*  I didn't realize how fucking socially stupid he is. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8453.52s)]
*  In an interview, it's the worst shit I've ever listened to. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8456.64s)]
*  Yeah, you better. I'm I'm coming. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8460.279999999999s)]
*  It's like, you don't know what the fuck to say. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8463.52s)]
*  Well, in his prime, the man was a monster. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8465.16s)]
*  Yeah, he was a beast, man. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8468.199999999999s)]
*  Monster in his prime when he beat up Chris Wyman and won the title. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8469.56s)]
*  That was a crazy fight. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8472.44s)]
*  And then he just kind of like fell off. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8473.72s)]
*  Well, Mike fucking checked his shot. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8475.6s)]
*  I think Mike ruined him. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8477.32s)]
*  This being yeah, I think Mike fucking broke him, man. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8478.72s)]
*  Well, that was a bad loss. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8481.279999999999s)]
*  And to fight Bissping on short notice and be like super cocky. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8483.08s)]
*  There's a thing about being confident and being delusional or overconfident [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8486.56s)]
*  or not respecting your opponent. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8491.16s)]
*  And, you know, I don't deserve it. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8493.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's what happened with Adesanya and Strickland. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8495.16s)]
*  I think Strickland is just that good. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8497.56s)]
*  I really do think I don't think I don't think is he like sidestepped him [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8499.0s)]
*  as much as we think. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8502.56s)]
*  I just think I think people don't understand when you're in there [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8503.52s)]
*  and you got a guy that never fucking takes a step backwards. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8506.6s)]
*  It doesn't get you off. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8510.16s)]
*  You never can plant. Right. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8511.52s)]
*  So you're not hitting your power shots. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8513.08s)]
*  You're not doing the damage that you would if you were dictating. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8515.24s)]
*  You're not going on your terms when you're going backwards the whole time. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8518.800000000001s)]
*  And that's that's why I think DDP has a good chance, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8521.720000000001s)]
*  because he's going to fight for that center to walk forward. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8524.56s)]
*  He's got to walks forward. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8527.960000000001s)]
*  Sean walks forward. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8529.2s)]
*  I just think because DDP kind of falls over his knee when he attacks, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8530.56s)]
*  I think he's going to get Sean to move back. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8534.6s)]
*  But for how long? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8536.76s)]
*  We'll see. I'm very interested to see who prevails. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8537.800000000001s)]
*  I think he does well early. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8540.52s)]
*  You know, boost fight, a boost, a metal fight. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8541.640000000001s)]
*  I think that fight was one of the most impressive fights of Strickland's fight. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8543.84s)]
*  I do, too. I think it was underwhelming to people, though. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8546.56s)]
*  A boost comes out in that first round like a bat out of hell. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8548.720000000001s)]
*  But he just gassed out. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8551.84s)]
*  And he would gas out the end of the first round. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8553.44s)]
*  He was throwing bombs. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8555.2s)]
*  He was trying to take him out. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8556.4s)]
*  I think a boost was just so used to taking guys out [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8557.44s)]
*  that he thought he could just put it on Sean. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8560.640000000001s)]
*  And he was hitting Sean with fucking fire. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8562.2s)]
*  Yeah, he was hitting him. That dude's good, man. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8564.4s)]
*  He's good. But Sean just wilted him. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8566.52s)]
*  He just wilted him. Yeah, man. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8569.560000000001s)]
*  He doesn't get tired. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8571.44s)]
*  It's crazy when you and when you have a guy who spars as much as Sean, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8573.08s)]
*  because the bulk of Sean's training is sparring and he spars hard. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8576.76s)]
*  He's so accustomed to that, that that's really like a fight all the time. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8580.800000000001s)]
*  He knows himself very well. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8585.44s)]
*  He knows what he's good at. Yeah. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8586.68s)]
*  He knows what he likes. He knows what works for him. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8588.12s)]
*  So why fix what's not broken? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8590.36s)]
*  You know, so how do you think? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8592.36s)]
*  What do you think Anasanya does when he comes back? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8594.76s)]
*  Like, who does he fight? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8596.84s)]
*  Like, he's not going to fight Paulo Costa. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8598.599999999999s)]
*  He's still ranked, right? Of course. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8600.199999999999s)]
*  Like, but why wouldn't you take him out of the rankings [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8602.24s)]
*  if he's saying he's not coming back for three, four years? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8604.76s)]
*  Because he's not really right. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8606.92s)]
*  So I mean, that's why I'm asking that is like, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8608.56s)]
*  I don't think he's going to sit out that long either. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8610.96s)]
*  Like three years is crazy. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8612.72s)]
*  That would be a crazy thing to do. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8614.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, unless look, I haven't talked to him. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8616.119999999999s)]
*  He may have like real injuries that need like real. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8619.359999999999s)]
*  Like we said, he fought so much. He was active. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8624.119999999999s)]
*  I think I think that this fight happens this weekend. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8626.24s)]
*  And I think maybe one or two more title fights, whoever is holding it. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8631.279999999999s)]
*  I think if DDP wins, there's a chance he slides in [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8635.4s)]
*  to fight Dracus [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8638.88s)]
*  just because of all that. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8641.599999999999s)]
*  Anasanya, it could be. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8642.68s)]
*  But also Hamza, you got to wonder where Hamza fits in that. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8644.64s)]
*  I mean, obviously, I'm going to get it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8647.68s)]
*  They might. They might think. Yeah. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8650.16s)]
*  Well, he's got superstar power. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8652.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, honestly, like I'm I get like nervous watching him [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8653.32s)]
*  like with excitement. Yeah. Because I love watching him. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8657.0s)]
*  It's it's his face. It's the way he looks. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8659.8s)]
*  It's his smile. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8661.76s)]
*  He's like doing this. Yeah. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8662.88s)]
*  Smiling at him at the beginning of the fight. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8664.08s)]
*  He looks evil. He does. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8665.76s)]
*  He's got the look of somebody that like, man, this motherfucker's about it. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8667.36s)]
*  And he is. He's tough. He's a gangster, man. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8670.92s)]
*  He goes out there and he does his game. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8673.039999999999s)]
*  And, you know, he's not a quitter. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8674.84s)]
*  But Anasanya injured shares timeline for full time return to training camp. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8676.96s)]
*  Last time I don't look return sooner than many expected, [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8681.160000000002s)]
*  although his current rehab schedule doesn't make UFC 300 fight look very likely. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8683.720000000001s)]
*  OK, so he is talking about coming back. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8687.6s)]
*  So when it says he's injured, does it share what the injury is? [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8689.44s)]
*  I was just looking to hopefully share that, but it doesn't say specifically. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8692.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's stuff that he's been dealing with. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8695.400000000001s)]
*  So I got this injury and it'll take a while to recover. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8699.2s)]
*  A long time to recover and whatnot. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8702.36s)]
*  Like, what are you telling them? A smart coach knows the injury exists. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8704.6s)]
*  We'll try to use it against you. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8707.52s)]
*  He's not going to tell anybody what the injury is. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8709.76s)]
*  He says, so far, I'm recovering very well and I'm on track. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8711.960000000001s)]
*  If he's got something that's that big, that's either like [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8714.640000000001s)]
*  knees or back or neck. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8718.4s)]
*  Generally, generally, or, you know, could be other joints. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8720.880000000001s)]
*  But generally, when someone's got a significant injury like that [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8724.880000000001s)]
*  and they need a lot of time off, it could be a back thing. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8728.56s)]
*  It could be a knee thing. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8731.800000000001s)]
*  Could be a gastrointestinal thing. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8733.36s)]
*  Yeah, you never know. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8735.32s)]
*  I mean, I think I think that's like I had a lot of struggles [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8736.6s)]
*  with like stomach problems like. Did you? Yeah, man. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8739.28s)]
*  I was just I always felt like I had like this crazy acid feeling in my stomach. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8741.720000000001s)]
*  It said he's aiming to get back in the gym training hard by the end of February. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8746.560000000001s)]
*  That doesn't bode well for fans hoping UFC 300 in April. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8750.800000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think he's going to be at UFC 300, but he might be [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8754.480000000001s)]
*  in the June card when Connor returns. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8757.24s)]
*  They're going to need they're going to want to stack that card up. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8760.2s)]
*  How do you think that goes? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8763.28s)]
*  Well, I don't like it that it's at 85. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8764.68s)]
*  Is it actually confirmed to 85? [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8766.44s)]
*  I don't know. I know he said that he's drinking wine and talking shit [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8768.44s)]
*  with a Rolex on like, who knows? [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8772.08s)]
*  Who knows that man drinks? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8774.28s)]
*  He does. I mean, drinks. I mean, does some stuff. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8775.880000000001s)]
*  But he likes to party. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8779.36s)]
*  I don't I don't see that's like. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8780.68s)]
*  And he's also he's getting older as well, and he's also coming off the sauce. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8783.480000000001s)]
*  Right. So he gets on the sauce to rightly so to recover from that bone injury. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8787.76s)]
*  It's a significant injury. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8792.640000000001s)]
*  You snap your femur in your your tibia rather in your fibula. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8794.12s)]
*  You snap those in half and your ankles dangling. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8798.36s)]
*  That's a long road back. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8801.08s)]
*  And it's been two years now plus. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8802.880000000001s)]
*  And, you know, if he really is going to fight in June [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8805.28s)]
*  and he maybe just doesn't want to cut any weight and he walks around at 85. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8808.92s)]
*  So what I was saying earlier, this is two things I would do. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8812.480000000001s)]
*  One is every 10 pounds to I would try to figure out a way to stop weight cutting. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8814.68s)]
*  I would try to figure out a way to get fighters to fight. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8819.880000000001s)]
*  I think almost killing yourself 24 hours before you fight in the cage is insane. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8822.12s)]
*  Almost killing yourself by dehydration is insane. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8828.68s)]
*  I think they should figure out what guys actually weigh [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8831.720000000001s)]
*  when they are low body fat, hydrated and say this is your weight class. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8835.0s)]
*  And this happens because there's not enough weight classes. Right. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8840.12s)]
*  And don't you think like they could instead of having fights [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8843.6s)]
*  scheduled at one fifty five and one seventy and one eighty five. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8847.480000000001s)]
*  What about more catch weight fights? [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8851.6s)]
*  What about more guys fighting at what their natural weight is? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8853.480000000001s)]
*  I don't understand why they don't do catch weight fights [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8856.56s)]
*  because there's so many like interesting matchups. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8858.56s)]
*  One of them was always the GSP versus Silva Anderson Silva. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8861.56s)]
*  But Silva is losing weight to get to one eighty five. Yeah. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8867.32s)]
*  And GSP, when he went up to fight one eighty five, when he fought Bisping, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8870.68s)]
*  he had to put a bunch of weight on. It was a struggle for him. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8874.519999999999s)]
*  He's eating like six times a day. He got sick. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8877.039999999999s)]
*  He was almost like throwing up all the time. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8879.6s)]
*  He's like he's trying to eat so much food just to maintain the mass. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8881.68s)]
*  I think that those fights are exciting, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8885.039999999999s)]
*  like superfights where guys go up a weight class or down a weight class. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8888.0s)]
*  But I think the real way to do this [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8891.279999999999s)]
*  is to reshape the sport where you cut what I call sanctioned cheating out. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8895.52s)]
*  Everybody's doing it. There's nothing wrong with doing it. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8901.199999999999s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8903.4s)]
*  But the fact that you don't really weigh one eighty five, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8904.68s)]
*  but you fight it at one hundred eighty five pounds. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8907.88s)]
*  Like when I interview you and you're one eighty five, I'm like, how? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8909.72s)]
*  One of you, Drekas, I'm like, how? How are you one eighty five? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8913.2s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. You're not one eighty five. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8915.960000000001s)]
*  You're fucking Paheta. Paheta is fucking huge. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8917.92s)]
*  How are you one eighty five? You're not one eighty five. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8922.24s)]
*  This is nonsense. You're really a two hundred twenty five pound man. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8924.4s)]
*  That's what you look like. That's what you are. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8927.36s)]
*  And that's really what the weight you should be fighting. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8929.640000000001s)]
*  And I think guys would fight better. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8931.76s)]
*  I think they would have less deterioration [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8933.44s)]
*  of their endurance over the course of a five round fight [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8936.68s)]
*  if they weren't fucking radically dehydrated twenty four hours ago. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8939.28s)]
*  It's just it's it's a new people. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8942.68s)]
*  That's that's that the other part of it, too, like people that walk around. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8945.2s)]
*  Like, let's say I walked around at eighty five. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8948.4s)]
*  Well, if I fight eighty five, I'm undersized. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8950.0s)]
*  Right. I'm walking around at eighty five. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8951.880000000001s)]
*  Of course, fucking people cutting down. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8953.2s)]
*  I don't know if you guys ever know that I'm not that big. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8955.12s)]
*  Frankie Edgar is the last guy that did that. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8957.640000000001s)]
*  Frankie Edgar is the last guy that was a champion that walked around at one [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8959.68s)]
*  fifty five and fought at one hundred one fifty five. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8962.84s)]
*  Always undersized. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8965.28s)]
*  B.J. Penn and Gray Maynard and beat all these guys at his natural weight. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8966.24s)]
*  But that's really not where he wound up at the end of his career at one thirty five, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8971.039999999999s)]
*  which is really probably where it should have been all along. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8974.16s)]
*  Yeah. But, you know, trying to convince guys to do that [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8976.76s)]
*  when there's guys like you that are cutting the weight, that are massive [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8980.56s)]
*  for that weight class, it's crazy. You would never do it. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8983.32s)]
*  You shouldn't do it. I don't fucking had the weight class. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8985.96s)]
*  I'm tired of fucking cutting weight. I hate cutting weight. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8988.199999999999s)]
*  They should add the weight class. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8989.52s)]
*  They should have one eighty five, one ninety five, two oh five, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8990.84s)]
*  maybe two fifteen, two twenty five. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8994.8s)]
*  You should have seen me early in my career. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8996.68s)]
*  Like I said, I was one seventy four fighting in one eighty five. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=8998.28s)]
*  I was skinny as fuck. I've always been skinny. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9001.04s)]
*  I'm still kind of what did you do to put the weight on? [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9003.24s)]
*  Did you do this is where I get to plug my guy. Right. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9005.24s)]
*  So I never had a strength and conditioning coach ever, ever. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9007.800000000001s)]
*  And when I got into so I was sitting at a light one day [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9011.0s)]
*  coming back from Philadelphia practice [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9015.0s)]
*  at Marquez and at the light, this guy is like, yo, he's like, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9017.880000000001s)]
*  you're Joe Piper, right? [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9021.44s)]
*  I was like, yeah. And he's like, you should come by my gym one day. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9022.28s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, like I was like, kind of like, yeah, like, no, probably not. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9025.12s)]
*  Get the fuck. I don't even know you. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9028.0s)]
*  Wines up. I winded up going, wind up hitting them up. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9030.56s)]
*  Like, yo, do you do personal training? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9032.8s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, of course. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9034.12s)]
*  His name's Adam Farris. He owns a gym called Pursuit. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9035.36s)]
*  It's right in Washington township, like right around where I live. Right. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9038.28s)]
*  I worked with him. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9042.28s)]
*  We didn't do anything crazy, anything hard or anything. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9043.2s)]
*  I was skinny as fuck still because I just came off of being, [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9045.76s)]
*  you know, having two surgeries and all that stuff. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9048.8s)]
*  I was still on the road back. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9050.92s)]
*  And after I won my 50 grand bonus and I won my debut, [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9052.44s)]
*  I was still super skinny. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9057.24s)]
*  I think DC interviewed me. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9059.08s)]
*  You interviewed me once and it was Miami. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9060.96s)]
*  So from that time, when I won my debut, I was still skinny. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9063.36s)]
*  And I didn't have a chance to ever have like a power program [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9067.6s)]
*  because I took a fight a month after I won the contract. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9070.039999999999s)]
*  So and then I didn't have a chance to have a weightlifting program [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9072.84s)]
*  because I had had a comeback fight and then I broke my ankle. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9076.28s)]
*  So I never got a long enough period to build my body back. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9079.56s)]
*  And I also didn't have a strength coach. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9083.32s)]
*  I just for some reason, I never thought I needed one. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9085.36s)]
*  I made it to the UFC on the first before I continue. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9088.08s)]
*  I made it to the contender series, hitting pads three days a week [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9090.800000000001s)]
*  with the man that I brought, Sam or Pisa, who had a full time job [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9093.92s)]
*  and we would do it at 5 a.m. three days a week. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9098.640000000001s)]
*  I wrestled with my my one of my best friends [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9101.28s)]
*  who literally was only a wrestler, had no MMA experience, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9105.0s)]
*  and he was like five seven. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9107.76s)]
*  And he was just like a soft fucking wrestler. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9109.76s)]
*  And that's it. I literally. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9112.320000000002s)]
*  And I started with Corey Anderson once a week. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9114.36s)]
*  Wow. That's it. That's how I made it. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9117.36s)]
*  That's how I was making all these fights and I was knocking everybody out [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9119.44s)]
*  and doing all this. So now that I have structure, [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9121.76s)]
*  now that I actually have a system with Marquez, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9124.0s)]
*  I have Jiu Jitsu with Johnathan Webb like in IB fucking Gerald Merchard, [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9127.400000000001s)]
*  the middleweight submission, highest fucking whatever dude got waxed, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9131.28s)]
*  like didn't even come close to beating me. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9136.08s)]
*  You know, so my Jiu Jitsu is underrated and my wrestling is underrated. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9138.52s)]
*  But I think it will come to light, you know, with a guy like Jack. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9142.84s)]
*  But so you started the strength and conditioning program. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9145.480000000001s)]
*  Strength and conditioning program. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9148.04s)]
*  So what kind of stuff are you doing? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9149.08s)]
*  So, man, like I was doing a power program. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9150.560000000001s)]
*  So I do like a six to eight week power program, [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9153.44s)]
*  the dead squats and bench. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9155.880000000001s)]
*  But bench is kind of bullshit because [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9158.52s)]
*  I care more about the explosive rep. Right. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9163.640000000001s)]
*  That's what we care about, because I'm just not putting more than two seventy [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9165.960000000001s)]
*  five on a bench with my elbow. Right. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9168.800000000001s)]
*  It's just not worth it. It's not worth the risk. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9171.08s)]
*  It's not worth the nerve pain. Right. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9172.96s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense for me. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9174.88s)]
*  So I'd be deadlift in a fuck and I was squatting a fuck ton. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9175.919999999998s)]
*  I always wanted thick legs. I never had it. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9180.08s)]
*  And then now I started putting on size and I wanted my back. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9183.32s)]
*  I've always had a real big back, like strong back, like wide. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9186.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, we were doing we were doing a power program. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9188.88s)]
*  And then we would go right into like explosiveness and jumps and ladder [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9192.56s)]
*  drills and just doing real simple movements, but a lot of functionality. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9196.199999999999s)]
*  Like a lot of core twisting, a lot of med ball slams, a lot of kettlebell stuff. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9200.28s)]
*  And yeah, that's my coach right there, Adam Ferris. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9205.88s)]
*  Dude, a hole in the wall. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9209.4s)]
*  Small ass gym like I hate those fucking things so much. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9211.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then the leg lunges are rough. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9217.16s)]
*  Yeah. And then we would just, you know. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9219.72s)]
*  But but my point is, Joe, I gave myself time after I won 50 grand [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9223.039999999999s)]
*  because then I could afford to eat the way I needed to. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9227.32s)]
*  I was basically I was going to be evicted from where I was living [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9230.08s)]
*  if I didn't get side money from Dana, who gave me a place to live [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9233.32s)]
*  after I won my contract. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9236.96s)]
*  And then when I got the 50 grand bonus, I was like, I'm going to fucking eat. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9238.48s)]
*  Like I get to eat good food. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9242.08s)]
*  I can buy, you know, food's expensive. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9243.24s)]
*  You know, so, yeah, I took like the next four or five ish months to build myself. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9245.599999999999s)]
*  And then when I came in against Gerald, you hype me up. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9251.08s)]
*  You were like, it's fucking size. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9254.08s)]
*  I was like, dude, my ego is like, yes, finally. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9255.72s)]
*  You looked awesome. We're called fucking skinny my whole life. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9260.0s)]
*  Not anymore, brother. Yeah, no, not at all. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9262.48s)]
*  And then obviously we're doing all that work with [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9264.72s)]
*  something that you've seen the documentary through all that time. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9268.279999999999s)]
*  So now it's finally, you know, hopefully we get to release it soon. But. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9272.08s)]
*  Oh, you do have the official trailer. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9278.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, we can we'll play the trailer and end on this. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9280.039999999999s)]
*  And listen, Joe, I'm a big fan. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9284.0s)]
*  I'm fucking pumped for you. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9286.359999999999s)]
*  I have, you know, I'm so fortunate to be in the position that I'm in, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9288.72s)]
*  to be able to watch these fights. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9292.599999999999s)]
*  And one of my favorite things is to watch guys come up. I love it. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9293.76s)]
*  Thank you, my man. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9297.76s)]
*  And the Rizaka San fight was to me, he was like, [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9298.4s)]
*  that's what I like to see a guy with potential to just like, oh, now you see it. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9302.32s)]
*  Like this guy's world championship potential. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9305.76s)]
*  It's right there. Exactly. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9308.519999999999s)]
*  And that's the only thing I'll say. And I'll leave my last. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9309.679999999998s)]
*  If you look at Jack and you look at me the way my mind is, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9312.599999999999s)]
*  Jack's not been able to climb to the top, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9315.84s)]
*  but he's been against the best and he's lost to the best. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9318.08s)]
*  Me. And if you look at him where he is now, coming off an injury, 35 years old, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9321.52s)]
*  do you look at him and say, hey, this guy could hold the belt? No. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9325.44s)]
*  I think the general public would say no. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9328.640000000001s)]
*  If you look at me, there's a lot of question marks still. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9330.640000000001s)]
*  I still have to prove myself against a lot of good guys. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9332.76s)]
*  I haven't beat anybody that's that good. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9334.880000000001s)]
*  So I'm really honest with myself, but I'm going to put myself on the map very soon. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9336.800000000001s)]
*  So I believe I'm excited. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9341.4s)]
*  And thank you for having me. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9343.0s)]
*  My pleasure. This has been fucking my whole life has been crazy since I got in the U.S.C. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9344.0s)]
*  It's awesome. Enjoy it, my friend. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9350.2s)]
*  OK, so this when is this documentary coming out? [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9351.92s)]
*  When when when would people be so our fellow friend Alex Davis, we're working on it. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9354.68s)]
*  Shout out to Alex. Can't say it yet. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9359.4s)]
*  But this was actually the filmed by Chandler Henry, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9361.64s)]
*  who is actually a kid that I went to high school with. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9365.72s)]
*  So now I got him a job and he does this for a living. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9368.12s)]
*  And this was made by him. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9370.52s)]
*  So I hope we're hoping really soon. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9372.04s)]
*  I just can't say yet, because that's Alex's job now. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9373.24s)]
*  All right. Well, Alex will take care of it, I'm sure. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9375.76s)]
*  So we'll end on this. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9377.92s)]
*  And this is available online. You can watch it. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9379.48s)]
*  It's what is it called, Jamie? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9381.56s)]
*  Official trailer Journey to the UFC, Joe Pfeiffer. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9383.92s)]
*  Go find it. And February. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9387.44s)]
*  What is the fight with Tremanson? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9390.52s)]
*  February 10th, February 10th, Las Vegas, main event from the apex. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9392.28s)]
*  Let's go. All right. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9395.88s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. Thank you. My pleasure. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9397.32s)]
*  I've always believed ever since I was a kid. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9399.24s)]
*  That fighting isn't something you do. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9406.12s)]
*  Fighting is something that chooses you. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9409.24s)]
*  All my life, I was a throwaway kid. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9413.32s)]
*  I was always terrified if I lost, I know I was getting screamed at [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9416.36s)]
*  or I was going to get hit. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9419.28s)]
*  Being slapped, punched, kicked, thrown down, hair ripped [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9421.16s)]
*  to the point that I ran away. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9425.0s)]
*  I was just shy of 17 years old because I couldn't take it anymore. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9426.56s)]
*  A lot of different people come from broken homes [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9431.84s)]
*  and they hold so much anger inside and hurt. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9434.96s)]
*  That makes a person just become kind of like an animal, you know? [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9440.6s)]
*  Joe is just on this tear and then he gets a call from Dana. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9447.199999999999s)]
*  Dana is like, I want to put you on the contender's seat. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9450.8s)]
*  Dana is like, I want to put you on the contender's seat. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9453.800000000001s)]
*  This is Joey's shot to get in there [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9458.0s)]
*  and a career ending injury just happened right in front of my face. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9460.6s)]
*  18 years in the game at that point. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9466.92s)]
*  Gone. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9469.4s)]
*  In Joe's case, this is the sort of injury that could absolutely end a career. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9475.28s)]
*  This is an unforgiving sport. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9480.84s)]
*  When you're the man, everybody loves you. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9482.2s)]
*  But the second you lose, everybody forgets you. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9483.88s)]
*  I wasn't ready to be forgotten. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9488.44s)]
*  The pain that I know that kid went through and overcame in his life. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9492.0s)]
*  If you want to beat him, you got to kill him. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9497.0s)]
*  Joe didn't really find out that he didn't have a place to live. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9500.0s)]
*  And he's like, what do I do? [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9504.119999999999s)]
*  And I was like, you go to Vegas and you fight. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9505.24s)]
*  The ground is powerful. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9512.16s)]
*  And that is the power. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9514.92s)]
*  And that's the power that all teammates are talking about. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9518.08s)]
*  Joe Piper makes his UFC debut after his week one performance on the Contender Series. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9521.8s)]
*  Eight of his nine wins are by finish and six of those are by knockout. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9527.0s)]
*  This fight should be an absolute war. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuQb11rSCXw&t=9530.84s)]
