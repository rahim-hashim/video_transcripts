# Joe Rogan Experience #1453 - Eric Weinstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf0_nMaQ6tA)
*  What's up, brother?
*  You hanging in there. I have not been off of my property more or less in two weeks
*  So it's crazy to see another human being. Yeah, I don't think this is healthy for us
*  I know this lockdown shit. Everybody's so weirded out
*  You want to run into people walking dogs like they don't want the dogs to get close to each other like hi
*  Everyone's across the street. Hi, and I'm a hugger right and we're in California
*  So I'm a hugger in California and all of my instincts are wrong. Everything's all messed up. Everyone's confused
*  Here's the big question. How long does it take before we normalize and go back?
*  Like let's say the end of July
*  Everyone announces we got this thing locked down. We have a viable treatment
*  It's no different than the flu you get you this
*  Chloroquine with the Z pack or whatever the current treatment is. Yeah, when do people start hugging again?
*  What do you mean? It's not it's gonna be crazy. Yeah, I mean, I think that the ideas were also starved for touch
*  Yeah, like we're gonna have a jubilee like you've never seen people gonna greet each other with tongues who are almost like just acquaintances
*  I don't think that's a good idea
*  There's still colds and cooties and all that other. I know but I think I think everybody's losing their shit
*  they definitely are I've been talking to a lot of friends that are on the
*  Extremely cautious side
*  Let's say that and you know
*  They're not going anywhere and they're wearing gloves and masks when they step outside their house to go do something the backyard
*  And they put the glove and mask down and they spray it with Lysol and they come inside and
*  It's not healthy and it is also healthy I mean the idea that we have not been tested in so long
*  It's good to remember also
*  that this stuff is live and real and it has always been live and real and
*  You know if it was possible to live without this stuff, that would be one thing
*  But the 75 year nap that we've been in since
*  1945 is itself the greatest threat to all of us right and and our preparedness is just a wonderful indicator
*  Where you actually get to see this is the quality of your experts. This is the quality of your leadership
*  This is what they look like when put under stress
*  That's true, right? That is a good that's a good thing and I'm impressed with the medical community
*  I'm impressed with the people that are recognizing that this is a huge problem
*  not so impressed with the administration of a lot of these hospitals that haven't prepared in terms of like masks and
*  Ventilators and a lot of these other things not so impressed with politicians
*  But also it just seems like everyone like you said was in this nap state and hadn't really been tested and really
*  Globally, no one had been tested since the pandemic of 1918 like this, right 68
*  Which I had I had the Hong Kong flu and
*  57 were sort of the best parallels to this you got the Hong Kong flu and six
*  I had the Hong Kong flu and was sick as a dog. I was San Francisco
*  I was like three two every three four. So I think it went from 68 to 70. You remember it. Oh
*  Yeah, I was in San Francisco. My grandma had to come up from LA to care for me
*  It was it was bad
*  This is like one of my earliest memories. Yeah, and so 68 and 57 I think are
*  the best comparables to this go before we go back to 1918 and
*  Almost nobody remembers these things like it's very weird
*  Many people had never heard of the Hong Kong flu when I started talking about the fact that I'd yeah
*  I vaguely remembered it until you just said it and I'm like, I'm slightly older than you right? Yeah, I'm 52. I'm 54. Yeah
*  I don't remember the Hong Kong flu, but I do you know what I mean?
*  Like I don't remember it personally. No, but but you as a health geek
*  Are up on these sorts of things and so you understand the ways in which you know
*  For example, you can have a flu where the I guess the cytokine storm
*  You know is your either the threat from your immunity your immune system is like bigger than the virus itself
*  There are all of these various weird things that happen, but I think that this let's call it the big nap
*  The big nap is itself
*  The greatest threat to us and this is this is bad
*  But it is also a shot across our bow and you know
*  This is what was happening in my mind when I was on here talking about the twin nuclei problem of selling atom
*  We didn't stop history. It's not like we're past atomic war like we figured that out
*  We just we just hit the pause button for a little while we hit snooze. Yeah, the fear is also that
*  Nefarious players will take this opportunity
*  To erode civil civil rights to
*  erode civil liberties and then China to gain power in the US market to
*  Gobble up a lot of stocks while everything is down and try to increase their stake in our economy and try to push
*  You know China's got its hands lovingly around our throat because our elite have been moving
*  into greater and greater states of China dependence
*  right, and so
*  With the BDSM community refers to his breath play and I don't like it
*  I do plays like you kind of like half choke somebody. Yeah, how do you know that? What?
*  I don't like the fact, you know, I went I went to MIT. MIT is wildly into BDSM. Somebody
*  Why are geeks?
*  And an aspis into BDSM. Somebody said lots of rules. What's an ASP?
*  Asperger's people right lots of rules. They like that
*  They love rules because they're whole because to do all this stuff safely you would have to have a huge hierarchy
*  right of rules and my claim is is that China is
*  They supply so much of our stuff we've moved all of our yeah
*  you know manufacturing base into these crazy supply chains and we are completely dependent on a strategic rival and
*  You know China is very careful
*  If you remember when they when they hosted the Olympics to have these amazingly impressive displays that are always friendly
*  but what they're really saying is we have our shit together and you know and
*  Our system was hackable. It was open as long for example, if you have a company that has a duty to its shareholders
*  That the directors of the company must do what is ever whatever is in the best interest of the shareholders and everything else doesn't matter
*  Then you can have a situation where a director has to move things to China because that isn't the best interest of the shareholders
*  Even if it's an absolutely
*  Not in the best interest of the United States
*  This is what Ralph Gommery who used to head the Sloan Foundation once said in an address
*  I was at at the National Academy of Sciences
*  He just said as a director I am incentivized to do exactly the wrong thing for the United States of America
*  So I'm gonna put one hat on and tell you as an American we must not move all of this over to China and
*  Then I'm gonna put my director's hat on and I'm gonna vote to move everything over to China because I have no choice
*  And so, you know in essence the smart good people all 11 of them were always fighting this thing about
*  You cannot become to China dependent and in during the big nap
*  There was no way to make this argument convincingly you couldn't say look we have a serious strategic problem
*  By your continuing moves to bring China in as the solution to every equation
*  We can't balance and that that is really the problem is is that there wasn't any ability to say
*  We are way too dependent on a strategic rival. You saw this at the beginning of the pandemic. Everyone was afraid of what I
*  Don't want to be a pure xenophobic
*  I don't appear like chicken little right and so all of our friends the nutcases the marginal weirdos the supposed grifters and gadflies
*  are the people who most got this one right and early and
*  All the respectable people like Nancy Pelosi telling people please go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese New Year
*  Bill de Blasio of New York saying despite corona vilars get out there, let you know, don't lead your lives
*  Don't don't let this thing hold you back
*  these people
*  Need to resign Nancy Pelosi should resign it's one thing to say we don't have enough information about this
*  It's another thing to say
*  Take the information that's coming in disregard it and get back in there and keep fueling the economy
*  This is exactly our leadership class their problem
*  They think about this in short-term economics the the long-term implications of us all sheltering in place
*  Nobody can compute the consequences of it. Not one person in the world knows what happens when you run this experiment
*  Yeah, it's a new thing right the made in America
*  Argument was always like sort of frivolous almost xenophobic like why do you want things made in America? What do you care?
*  Do you not do not like people from other countries? Do you not want to buy things from other countries?
*  It was like this made of it made in America thing was like people
*  disregarded it in a lot of ways
*  But when you realize that all of our medical supplies like so much of our electronics
*  So much of all the stuff that you need to kind of keep things
*  Exactly the way they are
*  It's cheaper to make it over there because they will like what we saw with Foxconn
*  Where they put nets around the building to keep people from jumping off and the weirdest thing was people trying to
*  argue that the suicide rate at Foxconn was essentially the same as the suicide rate in the general population
*  Well, you ever heard that argument. Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about? That's where they work
*  There's nets around where they work because so many people where they work jump off the building to end their life because their life sucks
*  That bad that they kill themselves at work
*  Do you know how rare it is to kill yourself at work?
*  Probably pretty fucking rare, you know how common it is where you have to put nets around the building
*  You're like look we're getting really tired of people going to the roof and jumping off because it's the easiest way to kill yourself
*  They're gonna get more creative
*  Yeah
*  The problem is we are all hooked up to this need for
*  Cheap products
*  Yeah profits when we can't figure out how to innovate enough to actually create the juice in our own system
*  And therefore we have to rationalize you were gonna say no
*  I was just gonna say I mean also we've gotten into this idea of every year
*  We have to have a newer better piece of electronics
*  Like if you had to go the rest of your life with an iPhone 11, how much would you suffer?
*  Not that much
*  Although I would say that many of us are not that excited about the next phone that that itself is an antiquated thing
*  But what I'm saying is like why can't they make it so that you can just fix this?
*  Yeah, you know, I mean like who the fuck fixes their phone. You don't fix your phone you bring it in
*  You're going back to like depression era thinking. Oh not depression era thinking. It's like why can't things be sustainable?
*  No, no, I the plans obsolescence and the need to constantly update so that you you never
*  It's a tricky problem if you need growth to power your system
*  Then in a weird way
*  It makes sense not to build the optimal phone
*  Right because if you were to build the optimal phone and then people stopped renewing everything your systems
*  Fuck then your system weirdly breaks down
*  So it makes sense at the level of the phone that you wouldn't want to do that
*  But weirdly in aggregate if you can't start innovate if you can't figure out how restart innovation in a big way
*  Now you're stuck with either having to learn to live in steady state, which none of us
*  Americans have no program for living in steady state
*  We need growth that was the whole point of the embedded growth obligation idea that it's suffused throughout every institution every pension plan assumes growth, right?
*  All right. So now we have this problem where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned
*  Obsolescence is like fake growth. It means that we're gonna rebuy our phones even as if they were now highly innovative
*  So there's like a weird way in which we've become dependent on nonsense
*  You know
*  Dependent on nonsense is a great way to put it
*  This is really highlighting that for a lot of people when people are home and they're with their families and they're not traveling
*  Especially people like me and my peers like a lot of my comedian friends who travel constantly
*  We're like it's kind of nice to be home, you know, everyone's sort of relooking at this
*  Like what is this life that we've sort of?
*  Accepted as this is the way things are is this really the way things should be
*  Or is this just we just got caught in a pattern and we're operating on momentum if the comedian
*  Far comedian force becomes non dysfunctional. We are screwed. Well, that's not
*  Require so many side
*  There's almost no group that is as far away from normal as community. I know that's why I get along with them
*  So well, it's so hard for me to hang out with regular folk
*  You know, that's that would be rough
*  Like if I had to live in a community of regular people that just work every day
*  What if you had like a community of only comedians? What would that look like? Oh, it'd be fun. Really? Yeah. Yeah, we'd be fine
*  We have that that's the comedy comedy story
*  Yeah
*  If the comedy store was just locked down on like a 500 acre piece of property and there's a bunch of houses on there
*  We would just entertain each other well half the fun of comedians is just us hanging out
*  We would just get together and laugh. Well, by the way, I should just say one of the great
*  Things about moving back to LA has been your invitations to come hang with the comedians at the store
*  What a great scene. I mean you made this point to me
*  About a Renaissance and then I think I sent you David Burns
*  Book about music the chapter on CBGB and it's almost an exact map of what CBGB did as the Harvard of punk
*  to the comedy stores Oxford of comedy. Yeah. Yeah, you you you've been to the back bar that
*  That's the holy grail
*  Well, that's the spot. You got me hammered
*  Two times ago and I was just I stumbled out of that thinking that was the best time I couldn't remember anything
*  Well, you know what? It's great to even when non comedians like yourself and you know
*  Melissa and Matt and you know some of their friends and all these other people come there and they're around these people
*  They act freer. They're laughing louder
*  They're making you know more off-color jokes and everyone's just laughing having fun
*  I mean that's the worst you have to be very careful. She's hilarious. She's very funny
*  Yeah, Melissa Chen, by the way, shout out shout out to Melissa. By the way, what great stuff she's doing on masks
*  Yeah, explain that
*  Well, she's just she just takes it on herself to ask the question
*  Why don't
*  Why don't our doctors and nurses have masks and so she's running around trying to figure out
*  How to connect donors flights product just
*  Whatever she's doing she's she's heroically like taking a ton of this on her shoulders and not
*  I'm hesitating because I don't even know what I'm allowed to say right?
*  We don't have to talk to me you should she's a very interesting person. I'm really glad you introduced me to her
*  She's fascinating
*  This like this is a great time to see what people are actually made out of
*  Yeah, who's heroic the heroic impulse sure and and who can keep their shit together when things go sideways
*  When things get Western as it were well
*  Let me ask you a question of all of the presidential candidates that were in the race like everybody's dropped outing as well
*  Which of them would you want in a kovat situation Tulsi Tulsi? That's by the way. That was my answer as well
*  I don't I didn't want her pop foreign policies. That's one of the reasons I wasn't like gung-ho and Tulsi
*  Didn't like some of the stuff about
*  In India, there's some issues about Modi and I don't want to get into that
*  But if you ask like who would you want to like?
*  Who has that kind of locked down military?
*  We have to make sense the bullshit needs to leave the room the odd thing is it's a
*  Millennial female of color that I would immediately want to subordinate to well
*  She's because she would also be no bullshit. She had the strength to call out all of the nonsense
*  She I'm positive. She would just say this is unacceptable. What are we doing? This is emergency times
*  We had to suspend these issues. We have to get these things to our
*  Doctors nurses emergency technicians
*  I mean look I should say that I'm trying to be like smiling and positive
*  But I am just burning with rage. I cannot believe weren't set up correctly
*  The scale of the screw-up and trying to even understand the government that I cannot trust as far as I can throw it to
*  feel contempt
*  for the Surgeon General of the United States
*  To say that the World Health Organization is a danger to World Health to say that the CDC is lying I
*  Hate being in a position where I believe
*  Yeah
*  What about Tulsi? She's she's a person of real character, you know
*  I don't see her like I see a lot of these people that are running for president. I see them wearing masks
*  You know, I mean, I don't even need to name names
*  But they're they're doing their best impression of a politician like a shitty comedian will do their best impression of David Tell
*  You know, that's the best example that someone gave me of
*  Like the comparison there's there's there's a style of communicating that a lot of them have adopted to try to appear
*  And you can tell that they're coached. They're trying to appear presidential. She's just that's who she is man
*  I've hung out with her off camera on camera
*  I've seen her just the way she communicates with people. No, I don't know her down to the bone
*  But what I see I'm very impressed with and she's developed her character over two tours of duty overseas
*  Again who volunteers who takes this stuff on? This is the weird thing because you know, I really before
*  COVID I was in this
*  Bernie Yang Tulsi
*  Mindset which is just what is the furball that I can shove down the throat of the DNC to make the party fall apart under
*  That Hillary Clinton overhang. Mm-hmm
*  The weird thing is in an actual pandemic. I
*  am almost positive that
*  She has the stuff. Yeah, it may not be her year, right? She's only 38. She's only 38
*  Yeah, it might not be her year, but but she'll get there. But but how interesting that like
*  When the shit hits the fan the person with the highest number of intersectional points maybe
*  Is actually the person that you want to lead on merit, right? But they don't want her which is even more
*  They don't want her because she can't be bought and sold. Well, that's it's really simple
*  I think that you know, we need to revisit some stuff which
*  all of this
*  Anger and
*  Ferocity that we were using to stand up to
*  Social engineering invading the mainstream conversation. I believe that COVID proves that it is deadly. Mm-hmm
*  That if your top concern is not appearing xenophobic people will die because you are functionally incompetent
*  You've just lost 40 IQ points for nothing. Well, that was the initial response to Trump's
*  Idea of shutting down flights from China people were furious and they were calling it racist
*  Well the idea that you can put a negative sign in front of Donald Trump and form an opinion that if he's stupid then
*  Whatever the reverse of what he does is smart. Right is itself moronic. It's dangerous. It's
*  It's completely irresponsible. And here's the weird thing. I said this to you on the phone the other day when we were talking
*  The weird thing Joe is is that we are the actual adults in the room
*  Tulsi you me
*  I don't know. That's a huge problem. What that's lumping me in with well, that's what I'm trying to say
*  but you but this is the problem which I think I get this actually better than you which is you have a beautiful life and
*  You recognize that part of it comes with humility of not thinking too much of yourself being self-deprecating all these things
*  I think that those are all to your credit
*  It is also time to lead and if you believe that you having to break out of whatever mindset you're in
*  Could be the difference between you know saving physicians lives and nurses lives you do it you would do it
*  For sure for sure. Okay. Well this thing is the flagship of
*  Pirate radio. I mean this is some is dot for the world and
*  The concept of some is that that that you would have truth that would circulate underground in the Soviet Union
*  That would not be like you are seldom
*  Rebroadcast inside of like MSNBC or CNN except when they're like going after you
*  Well, what's weird is Fox News rebroadcast me all the time
*  Well because Fox there are two sort of dominant narratives Fox News is the flagship inside the right of center
*  Gated institutional narrative and then you have all the other organs like MSNBC
*  CNN NPR
*  BuzzFeed, you know, whatever these things are in the left of center gated institutional narrative
*  Very often Fox will pick up on things that we do if they stick it in the eye of the left
*  Yeah, that's exactly and so the point is is that they selectively amplify us and that process of selective amplification is
*  Itself dangerous lot like I get invited
*  more frequently by Fox and people and I turn them down because
*  the narrative inside of like the New York Times is well, he's
*  Part of that right wing thing frequent Fox News contributor Eric Weinstein
*  Oh, that's the adjective adjective occupation name. Yes frequent adjective
*  Fox News contributor my occupation
*  And then my name that game
*  Like if NPR would call and put me on I would go on Fox
*  But the their very clever game is to make it sound like oh well you're choosing to go
*  No
*  You guys are choosing to ignore a lot of what's changing the culture and they're
*  Therefore the only people who are willing to ask us on and rebroadcast us are the people who are angry at the NPR CNN
*  MSNBC's well, I think they realize the limitations of their medium. I really do
*  I think that CNBC CNBC and
*  MSNBC and
*  CBS and NBC and ABC they all realize that they're in this really weird
*  Situation where they have to do these seven-minute segments interrupted by commercials. They they have a restriction
*  They can only air it, you know
*  But whatever time of night the show is supposed to be scheduled and you know
*  They rely on these internet clips to sort of carry the show
*  I mean the the YouTube clips are probably far more popular than anything they ever release that's on the air
*  What that that I mean that their distribution thing is fucked
*  It's very it's very bizarre and it was very interesting watching Bill Maher
*  Sit down here. He's like, I guess this is it the man cave
*  Yeah, good to see you Bill. He's like I'm here to grovel and ask whether you'll come on my show
*  No, he was trying to force me on his show. I know very little groveling. He's not a growler
*  No, but he's a strong armor. Well, what he is is he's caught and he's caught between two tectonic plates
*  He is the closest thing we have inside of the beast in some sense to what we're doing maybe yeah, he's a comic
*  He is a comic but he's also
*  You know, he's a guy with real courage. Yes, and he's in a very tough
*  I think he's in weirdly the toughest spot of us all well
*  He's a guy who's on the left also who thinks that a lot of the stuff as I do and as you do as well
*  a lot of stuff that's perpetrated by the people on the left is
*  Not just dangerous, but it's it's it
*  Empowers the right it empowers Trump supporters
*  It gets people on the fence to give up and and jump right and and get welcomed. Yeah, I've stopped being
*  Nice to these people. You can't be no it's just too much buffoonery. It's and it's like it's it's
*  Psychotically dangerous to watch people's continue the buffoonery in life-and-death situations. Yeah
*  Yeah, no, I agree and
*  Bills there on are you gonna do a shot? Have you done it? I'll do it eventually
*  I'm sure yeah, the only options that he gave me already had gigs booked. I see I I think that it's really important to use
*  I
*  mean, I don't know him at all but
*  To the extent that that was a beachhead to connect these two universes
*  My model of this is that we've got this traditional legacy world and we've got this sort of internet world that hovers above it
*  And in general the insulating layer between them is astounding at this late date
*  The number of things that happen on the internet that don't really have any echo inside of the mainstream
*  Is astounding in 2020 and then you get these arcs that happen between the two
*  So for example the famous Sam Harris interaction with Ben Affleck on Bill Maher's show
*  Yeah, was an arcing between these two universe
*  Well, it was also a guy on steroids that was roid raging at a guy who actually knows what he's talking about
*  That's what was going on I mean he was preparing for Batman okay did the math on that all right
*  But then that's why he was so angry
*  But then Kathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was another arcing where Kathy was playing the role of Ben Affleck Jordan Peterson
*  Not really no she what she was doing
*  She was trying to get away with this same strategy that she is lazy in a general void exactly for this sort of general
*  Boxing and categorizing of someone's opinions that don't really represent their represent their actual opinions
*  So what you're trying to say so what you're saying to me Joe is that I have absolutely no point in I'm a worthless human being
*  I should never visit your show is that what you're saying what you're trying to say so what I am trying to say is that
*  In a generalized sense she was just doing that same old same old thing with with a person who is not
*  Participating I sort of liken the go ahead
*  It's also that these people that they would victimize by putting them into these narratives right that in their custom to using these patterns
*  These people traditionally did not have any other way to respond right there was no internet clips that were released
*  You could do a letter to the editor well yeah, right on page 27. Yeah, and maybe they would print a retraction
*  You know and they will know the attention to it. I mean that this is standard
*  Standard behavior for some newspapers and some journalists right the unscrupulous one
*  Unfortunately, but this this model doesn't work anymore because anyone can go on YouTube and instantly say
*  My time on the Kathy Newman show this is what went wrong
*  This is why she did this and this is what they told me in the green room
*  And this is what blah blah blah blah, and then you lay it out sort of sort of no here's I mean
*  Let's play with me. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. I don't know
*  My take on it is that the great thing about
*  We have we have an ability to do almost anything we want on YouTube so long as we don't get shut down
*  Let's say that
*  However you also have this concern that as long as this world remains gated
*  If for example you have a closed world of people who are pretending to have conversations amongst themselves
*  Discussing the issues and then you have the institution say we're only going to deal with the authoritative sources
*  Then the problem is is that if you have a state of pretend, you know, LARPing or kfabe
*  Whatever you want to call it. Yeah, it's taking place inside the gated institutional narrative
*  The institutions are going to predicate their actions on the official nonsense
*  And whatever we do on YouTube as long as there is an insulating layer
*  Unless we can actually lob something into the wall, you know over the walls of the Citadel
*  They will continue to actually act as if we'd never said anything
*  Act as if we'd never said anything we never pointed it out
*  It's like you're at this kids magic show
*  which the
*  Music the magician is completely incompetent and the lights are on and you can see all the wires and trap doors and the magic show
*  Continues to go on and so you may make the point. Well, everybody can see that it's bullshit
*  But as long as the institutions agree to pretend that they believe the bullshit
*  We have a real problem that the Internet didn't solve that it's like you get internet might not have solved it
*  Sorry to interrupt you know, I think what it has done is severely erode the foundation of it to the point where the
*  trust in it is just
*  There's no real mainstream anymore
*  Like this idea that the mainstream news is the mainstream. Well, how is that real if YouTube videos get more views?
*  Like if you if you make a YouTube video and it gets five million views
*  But then something goes on MSNBC and it gets five hundred thousand views. Yeah, what's mainstream?
*  Well, what is mainstream now? We're talking about instead of mainstream media
*  I think the term traditional media is the best way the same way the term
*  Like legacy, but keep going legacy is good. Okay. Well look
*  For the longest time people had to use Morse code
*  Right, then they figured out phones and those Morse code guys were fucked right? What did you do?
*  What do we know and then phones were attached to cords? Yeah, but I'm still there's no no, there is there's still phone
*  But there's still a function
*  Unfortunately to the so I love the point that you're making. I'm just trying to figure out how to play with it
*  Let's assume that there is no mainstream left what we're really talking about is legacy institutional media
*  Yeah, and the great danger is that assume that the mainstream completely exits the building and it's only you know
*  10,000 people trading bullshit amongst themselves, but they also control all the institutions
*  So like you the world gets to keep reality
*  Mm-hmm, and we the institutions agree to traffic and bullshit
*  You can make lots of jokes at our expense
*  but we're also going to be figuring out whether we're going to stock masks or what our farming policy is or
*  how the US military should be deployed and where we should send troops to protect oil fields and all these kind of things and that
*  that's what's concerning me is is that a
*  Lot of us are settling for being right and having them look like idiots and their point is okay fine
*  We'll continue on we'll look like idiots, but we also still control the levers. So
*  With legacy media your your assertion is that legacy media has a much more impactful
*  presence in terms of foreign policy in terms of
*  Dealing with the pandemic the response like things along those lines
*  Let's play with it and see where it goes, okay
*  If you think about Wikipedia Wikipedia might have a rule that says we allow we don't do original research
*  So please link to authoritative sources and you say okay great. What are authoritative sources?
*  Mm-hmm. So now the authoritative source is the CDC
*  Or the WHO or the Surgeon General or the New York Times or CNN or MSNBC
*  Like if you have this but it's MSNBC
*  If someone just goes on on the air and let's have a little something
*  Yeah, is that an authoritative source wouldn't it be like an expert in health like someone who's gone over peer-reviewed studies someone who is
*  Well, who's the surgeon general right now? I don't know or CDC. Is that Redfield? I'm sure he's a competent physician
*  I also think that there's a whole thing about
*  pretending that masks don't work
*  Masks don't work in the general population. Please don't buy them our health care people need them. Is that what they're saying?
*  Well, that's what they've been saying right and so the issue is that you have some piece of nonsense
*  So the is a piece of nonsense because the California is now changing their recommendation and saying if you're going out in public
*  It's not just nonsense. It's deadly nonsense. It's deadly
*  Physician killing nonsense. I mean I'm trying smiles everyone smile
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean what we have is a situation in which we knew that the mask and personal protective equipment
*  Supplies are wildly off to say nothing of ventilators and ICU beds
*  And now what do we do about it?
*  so we have rules like please don't bring masks to work because it scares the patients or
*  Please don't wear homemade masks
*  Because they might actually be more germ-filled or virus-filled so you're back propagating
*  What you wish to be true to get the action that you're looking for what we have is a prisoner's dilemma
*  or if everybody runs and buys up masks who
*  Like the people we need to be protected most are the heroes who are actually dealing with you know
*  Multiple COVID patients and taking huge amounts of viral load
*  So there's no question in my mind that those those are the people that is a society if you would level with us
*  Like there is a speech to give which would go like this
*  You know my fellow Americans
*  As readiness are I am forced to tender my resignation effective of Friday this week
*  I have failed to heed many of the warnings in our academic literature
*  Because our reserves are severely depleted
*  Reserves are severely depleted it is imperative that we not suffer further loss of life and therefore I am
*  Forced to make an unusual request having failed you
*  I'm asking everyone who stockpiled masks for personal use
*  To think about doing something sacrificial for the good of us all our heroes are currently exposed
*  To the coronavirus and taking huge amounts of viral load and I'm asking you to donate any unused masks that you have
*  To this population as we are desperately trying to replenish our stocks
*  please continue to shelter in place and recognize that the benefit to you is minor and the benefit to us all is major and
*  This will be following your heroic impulse to bring us back together as a nation first of all is there a readiness czar no okay?
*  Second of all no one's gonna say that they're never gonna admit that they're gonna say we are
*  Justing I don't care we're adjusting our fire the nations based on revolt new no Joe
*  I am I'm gonna be completely unreasonable. I know I have this mode where I just become completely unreasonable
*  Okay, this is if that's where we are then it's time to revolt revolt. How I don't know well
*  We need people civil civil civil disobedience like to put our health care people
*  I mean I have not been off my property for weeks the reason I'm here in part is
*  To do what little I can and it's very little
*  To support the people who we who are our literal heroes our life and death putting their self themselves in harm's way
*  the idea of her hospital administrators
*  Abusing our physicians and nurses
*  Makes me apoplectic with rage the fact that these people are told that they can't talk to the press and they write to me
*  And they're their family and their children write to me my mother was asked to do this my uncle works in a prison
*  He's not allowed to wear a mask. He's not allowed to bring a mask. I sent a mask blah blah blah blah blah
*  Yeah, there's a lot of those stories. Okay
*  What the hell is wrong?
*  It is time for these people to resign and it is time for us to remember that we have the ability to turn over our
*  own government
*  This is we are so unprepared as
*  a nation and
*  We have been sold out for so long by our self-appointed leadership class who nobody wants
*  That we either remember who we are and how this game is played
*  I mean, this is like this is a pre-war footing and this can easily lead to war the transmission mechanism is you have everybody stay indoors
*  Because you're worried about deaths of accountability, which is
*  You know, I don't think they're worried about the number of deaths
*  I think they're worried about deaths that result from triage and that would result in career ending
*  Action
*  Action yeah, this is what you were saying on the phone. You think that's really what's bothering them?
*  Yes, and then but if we all have to stay home while they replenish our supplies
*  Then the economy goes into recession recession can become depression depressions lead to armed conflict and our armed conflict leads to war
*  That would be a transmission mechanism from these stupid masks
*  to stop something that nobody can handle and my
*  Here's the thing we're coming up on Passover and we do have a lot of people
*  We Jews have a tradition that I wish everybody had which is that we read one stupid story every goddamn year
*  Just to drill it into your head to make sure it's always fresh
*  And this is when it's time to leave when it's time to change don't wait for the bread to rise
*  This is what I say to every Jewish person like you're sitting around waiting for the bread to rise because they all know the story
*  which is you eat the goddamn matzah because the people who waited for the bread to rise are no longer with us their descendants are
*  no longer with us and
*  It is time to revolt
*  This leadership class is unworkable the reason that you and I both came to the word Tulsi instantly
*  I don't think you took much deliberation is
*  Because Tulsi would know what to do
*  Well, she's also the least
*  encumbered
*  Yeah, she's the least burdened by
*  Everybody in the system hates her. Yeah, you know and the whole point is she would put heads on pikes
*  Yeah, this is the moment for heads on pikes
*  And
*  It's important it's not a vengeance thing
*  The importance is what is the cost to you killing people by failing to heed the academic literature if a supply was was
*  Depleted and you didn't replenish it. What is the cost to you?
*  Well, there's lessons in how other countries have viewed this and how they chose to act particularly South Korea, right? South Korea acted quicker
*  Smaller population than us but a much smaller impact of the virus they shut things down very quickly. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, Singapore. I don't know how Singapore very very very thing
*  I think that they you know, they use surveillance and tracking and you know, making sure that they visited anybody was known. I mean
*  They had a different system and as people like you and me who love our civil liberties. I believe that in part
*  Singapore's draconian society lives off of
*  Things that only we can do due to our freedom
*  So you have to realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is is that China?
*  Has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of both worlds
*  They get the benefits of our middle finger
*  Which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable
*  So my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be
*  somewhat
*  Nationalistic more militaristic more commanding control
*  Like who would you take orders from? So in a lot of fields, I'd take orders from you
*  You're the big dog in this space, you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something
*  I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want
*  Sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was to be a leader
*  People to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important
*  When we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order
*  Like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my always
*  Best practices is can I get you coffee?
*  You know, it's very important to show that the ability to ask
*  To serve somebody else and the ability to lead are tied
*  You have to be a follower to be a leader and a leader to be a follower
*  You can't you shouldn't be one of the other
*  We need right now a more
*  War we need more of a war footing. We need a war president. We need we need war senators
*  We need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill
*  de Blasio needs to resign I
*  Think that this administration
*  You know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and
*  The the imperative is to stop back propagating
*  what you want to have what you want us to do like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and
*  Come up with the lie that would cause us to act
*  Selfishly rationally like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled
*  Then the idea is like oh, okay, so I guess I won't use the mask
*  Well, yeah, because you lied to me and the idea is that that's what you're trying to do
*  You're trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I want. I
*  Don't understand what you're saying about these masks. What are you saying? So if I say for example
*  Let's imagine that I don't want to put seatbelts in cars
*  Okay, and I say, you know Joe a seatbelt could trap you should your car go into the water off of a bridge
*  You could in fact die from the seat belt because you'd become entangled and would not be able to save yourself
*  The right but the problem with that analogy is seatbelts actually do say lies on but is it is it possible that they're just
*  Acting poorly with this mask thing, but that masks actually can contain a lot of viruses and they can
*  See those can kill you but do you believe that's what I'm trying to do
*  I'm trying to say that as a related rate problem
*  Let's talk about everybody who gets sick and dies from contaminated masks
*  Everybody who gets sick and dies from a feel a false feeling of safety
*  Let's just go through a huge list of every bad thing
*  I see the analogy and now the idea is think about all the lives saved because of masks both in terms of transmission
*  Which I don't cough on you I cough into the mask or in terms of I don't breathe in either aerosolized or droplets
*  Whatever blah blah blah and now the the two are real
*  but you're focusing on like the seatbelt deaths of entanglement right because you actually have a
*  a covert agenda and like and you're gonna think their covert agendas
*  Oh, I don't know exactly but if you if I had to speculate I go like go like this one
*  We're terrified of triage deaths deaths that occurred simply because we didn't have enough resources that were mandated to be stockpiled or
*  Talked about in the literature. That's one thing there's liability then there's liability which is oh we were following the surgeon general's recommendation at the time
*  Now if somebody suddenly found you know like all the masks in the world
*  I think that the surgeon general would suddenly say the science has become conclusive
*  Mmm
*  Because there would no longer be a worry about liability you would just get those masks the people you'd get the masks of the people who?
*  Need them and then you'd stop transmission. You'd slow transitions
*  Transmissions by you think there's also a lot of just figuring it out as they go along
*  No
*  There is figuring this out as it goes along as regards the masks I believe that everybody knows that masks save lives on balance
*  They know that the people who need the most
*  Have very weird rules
*  There's this whole thing about the states versus the federal government. There's this issue about price gouging and price mechanisms
*  There are all sorts of things stopping the mask problem from being
*  Sorted out in one of which is the number of masks that are produced in China
*  And the fact that we may have sent masks and personal protective equipment to China
*  So there's a huge issue of accountability and responsibility and that we're back
*  Propagating our response how much are we quarantined and how much are we locked down? What are we saying about?
*  About
*  About what why the physicians are being told not to wear masks when they're seeing patients
*  I mean, I'm talking about deadly nonsense deadly structural nonsense
*  And if people like you and me don't call this out
*  using
*  Like these crazy channels that we have
*  Then the the narrative just stands and so partially what we're doing is a parallel sense-making operation to the standard media
*  Which is Twitter said we will now be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative health sources
*  So that's just what I did
*  Search in general is lying CDC is lying. WHO is lying come at me. Do you think they're lying?
*  Yes, why do you think they're lying? Like give me a specific example why you feel like they're lying?
*  Well, for example, you saw this interaction with the was it Hong Kong TV asking about the WHO about Taiwan
*  Yeah, that was insane. Well explain that because it's fucking insane. It was insane to watch
*  First of all, he pretended the head of the WHO pretended he didn't hear them
*  And then he had them say it again first of all, he moves like yes, you can see his hand
*  Yes, go to cut off the connection. He hung up. He said I couldn't hear she's okay. I'll repeat the question
*  He's like no, let's go on to the next one. Well, why would he want to go into the next one if he didn't hear it?
*  Come on. Yeah, I don't even have here's the point
*  We are so afraid explain what he did to people that don't know because people are listening here and they're little he was asked
*  About the Taiwanese response to the kovat epidemic and he didn't want to say
*  Taiwan because China claims that Taiwan is part of China
*  And because China exercises so much influence over the WHO
*  He wanted to say some very general thing which is like I think all provinces of China have been doing an excellent job
*  That's a different country Taiwan
*  Because there's a dispute
*  So what do you think China's most interested in China the People's Republic of China the Communist China?
*  Communist Chinese want
*  no
*  recognition of their existing something called Taiwan and
*  Why does the World Health Organization
*  Give into that?
*  Well, how do how do different nations get control of things?
*  You know, we have influence at the UN and we've caused the UN to do things that are America centric
*  You know other countries have influence and you do this by being on particular committees rotating directorships who pays
*  The cost I don't know how
*  The WHO seems to be so enmeshed with China and I don't want to opine about these things because I want to keep my voice
*  Right, but it spoke volumes to watch that guy do that and do that little dance to avoid saying Taiwan
*  My entire life looks like that interview. I hate to say it this way, but my relationship with authority and that my big critique is is that
*  This is the generic expectation across almost all institutions now
*  they are all serving bizarre goals because
*  Growth is what gave us our independence and when we became less innovative and we or the innovation
*  dried up and we couldn't grow our way into new things the number of people who could use their middle finger effectively and
*  say I'm steering this this organization to do the right thing and
*  This is my bet and we're gonna go forward
*  Those people as a class were removed if you think about like what do you do with Churchill when there isn't a World War two to
*  win
*  Very uncomfortable like what would he open a dry cleaner? We don't know
*  You have you have special people who really only shine when there's an emergency there's a guy
*  Named Jay Prakash Narayan in India who's very important
*  and he was one of the sort of founding father fathers of modern India and
*  After India Indian independence was achieved lots of the people who had been founding fathers went to
*  The next phase where they became like they enriched themselves they did standard political things to gain power in the system
*  he was the one guy who sort of stayed true to the revolutionary spirit and
*  Bizarrely when Indira Gandhi created a state of emergency
*  Which was a disaster in India the people said well, who can we turn to in a dark time and oddly?
*  I
*  Guess Prakash means light so there was this phrase like in the darkness
*  There is one light Jay Prakash Jay Prakash Jay Prakash
*  They turned to the one guy who'd become the patron saint of lost causes because he never broke faith
*  With the revolutionary spirit and he's get he gets called up once but he's incredibly important because everybody knows in a dark time who they
*  can trust
*  right
*  That's a very important parallel to where we are now who are the break glass in case of emergency people
*  Yeah, when you when you watch the people that are talking in these presidential addresses, there's none of those
*  I don't see any break glass
*  I mean this Fauci guy is obviously an expert in diseases
*  And he's a doctor and he's trying to do his best to lay out the ground rules of what we need to do and what
*  This looks like over the next couple of months
*  But but it's like Jocko willing, you know like
*  Jocko is not telling you don't worry. You don't have to change your routine. You can get up at 930
*  Just do a little bit just a little bit. It's like
*  Discipline equals freedom. I'm up at 430. What are you doing in bed? It's time for discipline
*  Well, because he's a military guy and military people don't have any room for bullshit
*  They don't have some military people do love
*  Right, but people like seals they don't have any room for fluff
*  Well, because you have to be able to perform. Well, okay, so then in that situation, so fuck your feelings get up at 430
*  That's that's how they feel. That's what I'm trying to those those you can just do a little bit and that's great
*  That's great. You guys are enforcing mediocrity. Congratulations
*  But that's and that's what I'm trying to get at which is we have a situation where we know
*  If you have two trainers and one of them is doing the don't worry and the other one is like
*  I'm not gonna lie to you. You're gonna be sore. You're gonna be miserable. This isn't gonna be fun
*  Which do you choose some people will go with the former? Yeah, they like to stay fat
*  It's a lot of that out there. Okay, mediocrity is a very comforting thing. I hear you. Yeah, it's fucking look
*  It's hard. It's hard to be that 430 in the morning guy. Well some days that alarm goes off
*  He's gotta be like fuck this man. Well, you know that Jaco doesn't live that 24-7. Yes, he does
*  No, he may live it. He may live it
*  18-6
*  Nobody goes to sleep. You remember that thing he did about the cake? I was at a birthday party
*  There was a delicious piece of cake in front of me. I struggled eventually
*  Come to I succumb to temptation. Yeah, but I'm telling you man
*  That doesn't even mean anything that goes through that fucking blast furnace of a body. Yeah, but I'm saying nobody's 24-7
*  Is a fake weakness, yeah, he'll give into it to a formative weakness
*  Yes, he just wants to hear immortal like there's appearing to make you sort of commiserate with him
*  He's appearing that all I have some failings to I eat cake
*  Yeah, what he doesn't tell you see he probably went down to his fucking dungeon basement after he ate cake
*  It did squats for an hour
*  Look, I believe that there's people that are really that guy. Yeah, and he's one of those those people. He's really that guy
*  He's that guy all the time, but I spent a lot of time with Jaco. Okay, he's that guy
*  But that's because he's a little I won't seal I want but I want one of those people right now important right now
*  Yeah, those guys are important and we have to clean out these up this class of people that put up with each other
*  It's like the reason they put up with each other and they don't like indict each other or sue each other
*  I report each other is is that they're all the same. Yeah, and and that was the key skill for
*  Between 35 and 50 years which is knowing what not to say to upset the institutional
*  Well, that is politics and that's one of the things that discuss people about it
*  That's one of the things that one of the reasons why Donald Trump actually got into office
*  Yeah, people looked at him as an antidote. I mean, that's that's right clean up the swamp drain the swamp. That's him
*  Well, that's what they thought they thought this might be he might bring in his own swamp, but he was against their swamp
*  Exactly, yeah exactly and then Bernie Sanders has his own kind of swamp. He's got a different kind of swamp
*  You know, everyone's got their own swamp. It's like what what is your?
*  particular
*  Pattern that you would like to push, you know what has got you to the dance
*  You know, sorry, I'm laughing but Barry Weiss was sitting here and she's just like cat so Joe
*  What do you think you'll vote for?
*  And then you called me up you like Eric, what did I just do?
*  I
*  Think you might have just swung the election. Well the wrong way or the right way
*  It's the whole thing like Joe Biden being the main guy is the only reason why they went after Bernie Sanders
*  It went after me
*  I mean that the whole idea was just to reinforce the idea that Bernie Sanders is making
*  Poor choices by connecting to him to someone who says fucked up things when he's trying to be funny
*  Yeah, you know and and you put it in print with some quotations behind it and like wow, this guy's awful
*  You know everything out of context is awful and what they're trying to do without a doubt is the same thing
*  We're talking about the guy who's willing to dance with them
*  Which is Joe Biden the guy who's the the professional politician, which they don't give a fuck if he can barely talk
*  They don't give a fuck if he forgets what he's saying halfway into conversations
*  But this is the whole thing about the gated institutional narrative
*  They just the key issue and I learned this when I used to do immigration stuff in Washington during the 90s
*  I learned this concept of steady hands. This is like one of the most terrifying phrases ever
*  So I told you I think at some point that in New York whenever
*  People are deciding to do a bad thing to screw people over they always use the phrase
*  It's a beautiful thing meaning that you can extract money from people who have no no say in the matter
*  In Washington, this financial circles you're talking about. Yeah, New York finance. So whenever you hear the phrase, it's a beautiful thing
*  It means somebody is being raped
*  financially, yeah
*  In Washington the phrase that I learned to fear is steady hands
*  He's a pair of steady hands
*  It means you can count on him to do the wrong thing in an emergency to keep everybody on the inside. Okay
*  And there's like a separate system for promoting the people who do the wrong thing and making sure because everybody inside is super dependent on
*  Somebody burning all of their credibility in public
*  Steady hands. Oh
*  Yeah, I mean that's the main hope of
*  this free information society that all of these disgusting
*  Practices these legacy practices get exposed. Well, here's the weird thing when Amy Klobuchar dropped out
*  It was like a baby boomer born in the I'm gonna say 61 something like that
*  Everyone remaining was born in the 1940s
*  Elizabeth Warren was the youngest
*  Then you had like Mike Bloomberg Bernie Sanders Joe Biden and Donald Trump
*  So everyone was like born between 41 and 49
*  Now all of those people would be the oldest president all of them the oldest president at inauguration
*  Like we've lost our mind. This is normal to us. This isn't really commented upon that. You would have five for five
*  Septuagenarians vying for the presidency of the United States
*  It's pretty crazy
*  Just the I mean the the evidence is the clearest with Joe Biden, right?
*  Yeah, because he's showing actual real deterioration, but we've seen deterioration from Trump particularly earlier
*  in the first
*  year or two of his term there's some spectacular videos of him falling into the
*  Of him falling apart where he can couldn't enunciate words
*  He couldn't he couldn't say words correctly while he's speaking to the country
*  His tongue was like swollen in his throat. It was very strange, right?
*  But people think of that as maybe a substance issue
*  Like he goes up and he goes down and sometimes he catches it on the wrong part of the wave
*  And that's when he's in front of the camera and he you know, he struggles through it
*  But he literally can't pronounce words, but then he'll bounce back and he'll be fine
*  Joe Biden's not bouncing back
*  You know whether he has an aversion to the same sort of supplements that Donald's using. I don't know
*  I don't know what's going on. Yes. He has these episodes
*  He's inconsistent sometimes he seems fine
*  And then sometimes he seems like he's completely lost and you know, I learned about this was very uncomfortable for me
*  I was watching Stefan Molyneux and
*  Mike Cernovich going on and on about Hillary's health
*  Mm-hmm, and I was just thinking these guys are actually weirdly making sense on this topic and
*  I've never really interacted with Stefan Molyneux at all and he sort of scares me and I don't really want him in my life
*  But didn't mean that he wasn't right and he wasn't being courageous and saying it and then when Donna Brazil I think
*  Came out later and said yeah, there were real concerns about Hillary's health all along. Well, she was fainting
*  Yeah, whenever you lose consciousness, that's a we don't know what it was that she was doing but what I'm trying to get at
*  would be that
*  We are dependent on these people that we are told are trolls as the free people
*  I remember Orwell talking about the proletariat where the proletariat was weirdly free and the central
*  People were the ones who had no freedom. I saw this also in the fall of the Soviet Union. I had
*  Family in Moscow and Kiev and in Chernoff see that we
*  discovered right at the end of the Soviet Union and I went over the visit and
*  I remember preparing for that visit. I called up these people in Chernoff see right near Moldova in the extreme west of the Ukraine. I
*  Said, you know
*  That's what you like. Hello, and I hear the voice on the other end of the phone
*  It was like the time when long-distance phone calls were still romantic and I hear shalom
*  Welcome and I'm realizing that these are young people are still speaking Yiddish
*  They don't give a shit about anything because they're not important. They're not in Moscow. They're not in st. Petersburg
*  they're on the periphery and there's a measure of freedom that comes from
*  Just not being central and right you can communicate freely and you can think freely
*  Is anyone in legacy media media talking openly on any of these shows about Biden's deterioration?
*  I don't know, you know Tucker Carlson is another person to watch
*  Who is freer? He's free of Fox. He's able to go against Fox. Yeah, I'm looking at Greg Gutfeld
*  I don't know what Greg has been saying, but there are a small number of interesting people who are still housed
*  Inside of the of the belly of the beast and I don't know if you hear my
*  Heard my theory about the rebel end of corporate the corporate end of rebel
*  So you and I I think would be sort of well at least I'm wearing a jacket I would be the corporate end of rebel
*  Okay, you might be the rebel end of rebel. I don't know you're
*  You're faking being the rebel in that you're pretty so yeah
*  What am I faking what well look at you being the rebel end of rebel those tattoos obviously wash after you put you just apply them
*  Every day, but the corp the rebel end of corporate would be like Barry Weiss
*  Okay, right so she's she's in the belly of the beast, but she's pushing the edge bill Moore would
*  straddle corporate end of rebel rebel end of corporate unclear
*  Right. And so there is an important partnership across this if you think about
*  You remember the film inglorious bastards to do like that one sure loved it
*  Okay
*  lieutenant Aldo Ray is this interface between regular army and the psychotic Jews who will kill Nazis given any opportunity and
*  You need people who interface between like the bad boys and the regular units
*  Hmm, and these are incredibly important. What is the plural of Nexus next? I I don't know
*  we got into trouble the first time with
*  Octopus octopi no, it's actually
*  The recommended one is octopodes spelled spelled octopodes. Really? Yeah. Whoa, but I've seen octopi
*  Yeah, well people people use oct they use
*  octopuses octopi
*  There it is plural form of Nexus is
*  Nexus or Nexus. Okay. Oh boy Jamie with the wind
*  How weird that it's either or that it could just be Nexus the plural form of Nexus is that makes sense?
*  I guess so these Nexus
*  Are
*  Incredibly important and we have to keep them up and I'm worried about the
*  Corporate the rebel end of corporate because these corporations are starting to realize that their need for KFabe is just far exceeding
*  K Fabe K Fabe K Fabe is carnival speak for the word fake and when catch wrestling
*  Devolved into professional wrestling, you know about all that
*  That's very interesting
*  Yeah, that's that's a weird. Well, that's obscure the catch wrestling. Oh carnival wrestling actually Jamie
*  Could you bring up the word K Fabe and Weinstein?
*  Can you name any people that were involved in catch wrestling the real catch wrestling? How far do you go with this?
*  Well, there you know farmer burns was farmer burns farmer burns
*  No
*  Famous catch wrestling guy used to do a hangman's drop his neck was so strong
*  He tied a noose around it and dropped six feet and hang there
*  so when
*  By the way, if you want to read a great book on professional wrestling, I would highly recommend the book ringside
*  Which talks about the evolution. So what I call K fabrication
*  Okay is the transition of something that is
*  Usually has twin attributes is very dangerous and very boring
*  So old style wrestling was incredibly dangerous and people would you know be crippled from about?
*  so as a result they would often just like circle each other not really engage and
*  Like wars like this mostly war is extremely boring and then you know, obviously can be quite deadly. So in order to
*  Routinize these things we create K Fabe which is the system of stratified lies that professional wrestling is undergirded by
*  So, you you know what a do you know what a worked shoot is? Yes. Okay. What's a worked shoot?
*  Well a shoot is an actual fight and a worked shoot like a work is a fake fight, right?
*  So like if two guys were pretending to fight and there was there's actually there was an issue
*  I should so just to lay this all out in Japan
*  there there's an extreme admiration for professional wrestling and
*  professional wrestlers would
*  Get into mixed martial arts and they would get into mixed martial arts with varying levels of actual commitment
*  So some of them would get into mixed martial arts and have fake fights. This is like pride
*  Yes, exactly pride and some of pride actually was founded by Hicks and Gracie
*  Who was as legit as a man has ever lived and
*  Takata who was a famous professional wrestler and Hicks and fucked up Takata in a real fight
*  He only would have real fights. Who was the Gracie killer who came out of Japan? That's Sakuraba. I'm sorry
*  Yeah, Sakuraba. He well, he's a phenomenal catch wrestler
*  I don't want to blow you off course his his he came from I believe Carl gotch and
*  Billy Costello and I think that's the name of the gentleman. There was a bunch of people who taught him
*  Catch wrestling so his style was submission
*  Oriented catch wrestling. He had he had like both like he you know
*  He was involved in professional wrestling as well, but he was a legit fighter
*  Anyway, the point was there was a weird blurring of the lines and there were some fights like
*  Mark Coleman had a fight with Takata where it was really clear that Mark Coleman got paid to take a dive because Mark Coleman
*  Should have smashed that dude and he gets caught in his heel hook. He doesn't tap
*  He's gonna tap then he winds up tapping it was like whoa
*  And he he but everyone watching that knows fighting was like get the fuck out of here. What is happening here?
*  Oh my god, it's a fake fight
*  It could have been a contender so there was fake fights mixed in with real fights, right?
*  It was pretty common pretty common and this is what happened in the transition in the early 20th century between catch wrestling and professional
*  Yeah, this is that you
*  You start doping reality with fakeness and the thing I was asking about the worked shoot
*  It has to do with the layering of
*  Nonsense and reality. So the idea is that you have something which is ostensibly fake
*  Then you have a breaking of kayfabe ostensibly, which is the shoot on top of the expected work
*  But a work shoot is tertiary and that the shoot is in self fake
*  And so a work shoot is a tertiary deception it's a fake fight that appears real
*  It's a fake real fight that appears to break out of a fake thing that is pretending to maybe it's quaternary
*  You know the brain can't go much beyond four levels of lies, right? And so you had a famous storyline
*  I can't remember who it was where a wrestler was apparently supposedly having an affair with another wrestlers
*  wife and
*  That was the storyline
*  So the people who write those these things are called bookers
*  So the bookers had come up with this storyline and then the affair became real
*  Because the brain couldn't sort of manage all of the deception sometimes you saw the two people actually together, right?
*  Because they were supposed to hang out and pretend right now like let's just do this shit, right and so, you know oddly I
*  Was fascinated by the moment where Vince McMahon declared I think to the New Jersey
*  sporting Commission
*  He made this unbelievable. It's like one of the great moments in the 20th century. I think
*  He realized that he was gonna be taxed into oblivion
*  and so he had a choice should he
*  Get should he pay this tax or do something really bold and he went in front of them
*  He said you realize that everything we do is fake
*  Now that could have completely toppled the wrestling world the admission that there was no reality to this
*  Was a potential death blow
*  So he said this is all staged all the fights and the the winners are known in advance
*  You can't tax us because we aren't actually a sport and you don't have any jurisdiction over us. Mm-hmm, and then
*  It turned out nobody cared
*  Right. And so the interesting thing is that the youth used to have this concept of a smark a mark is somebody who doesn't know
*  they're being conned a
*  Smart mark or smark is somebody who knows that they're being conned and still continues to play
*  So in some sense it was the bet that you could take all the marks and turn them into smarks and the business empire would
*  Continue and you wouldn't have to pay the tax
*  So I was hanging out as what does with Hulk Hogan and I was trying to check whether or not this was true
*  And he said to me
*  Eric you realize who came up with that strategy me
*  So I was like what he said. Yeah, I was the one who said that we should do you believe him?
*  I don't know. It's hard to tell well, that's the whole point of that kayfabe. Yeah, that's where it gets weird
*  Did you ever see the interview where John Stossel is accusing a professional wrestler of it being fake?
*  So he decided to smack him in the head and ask him if that was fake
*  It's really horrific because he dropped he ruptured his eardrum. I mean, this is an enormous man
*  I forget the guy it ruined the guy's career the guy who is the wrestler but he he hits him with an open hand
*  I mean, it's an enormous full blast hits him on the head with this this open hand and drops him
*  He goes was that fake was that fake get up pussy and he goes that fake and he hits him again and drops him again
*  Was that fake? Well, okay, let's talk about this. I
*  I don't think professional wrestling is fake. What the fuck are you saying? Well, I know what you're saying
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean there he's got this is it. This is the guy
*  We'll play it so we can hear what he's saying
*  Okay, we'll get we'll get into trouble here with you too. But he hits him in the side of the head and then he hits him
*  again
*  It's dr. D. I think dr. Death or something that fucked him up, right? Is that him right there?
*  Is that the guy now? Jesus Christ time is a cruel bitch
*  Is that the same guy?
*  Is that him Jesus Christ
*  Yeah
*  legendary wrestler bounty hunter and author of don't call me fake. Dr. David Schultz goes into detail about professionalist
*  2020 incident where he slapped John Stossel look he's got a t-shirt on it about it and everything Jesus Christ. It's his whole life now
*  Yeah, well, that's his that's his moment. Wow. It's not fake
*  No
*  Orchestrated it's the the results are known in advance
*  The death rate of those guys is like nothing else
*  You'd have to look to like wingsuit flyers to see people who die at the level that professional wrestlers do the the the punishment
*  That they take and weirdly the skill level. I
*  Whole Hogan put me in a headlock. Why did you let him do that? Did you ever see what he did to Richard Belzer?
*  Look I'm sorry
*  I know that he's said and done bad things but there's so much love that comes pouring out of Hulk Hogan and I agree brother
*  No, he's a great guy, but he put bells are asleep on his television show and bells are fell and bounced his head off the ground
*  Hulk Hulk had me in a headlock
*  And I know that if that guy had so much as sneezed my head would have just popped off of my trunk, right?
*  I mean
*  That guy's a beast. He's a huge man. He's a huge man
*  Yeah, you know, he's lost like four inches of height because of all his back surgeries. Yeah
*  Yeah, I first met him like way way way back in the day. I ran into him. I didn't meet him meet him
*  I just ran into him on the street in Beverly Hills. I was like, holy fuck and
*  Then I interviewed him for spike TV back in the day when spike TV was
*  They were doing professional wrestling on spike TV and they wanted to me to interview him while I was doing the UFC
*  So I interviewed we had a fun time together, but he was considerably smaller. It was really interesting
*  It's like that was just oh there's Belser
*  So he put bells are in what we call like a power guillotine and look bells are out cold right here
*  Why watch the left arm? There it is out cold
*  So watch you just drop some that could have killed him that part right there where he falls and he bangs his head off the ground
*  like
*  He just dropped him like he was on a padded mat or something like that
*  You really should never do that to someone but they don't worry about theirself
*  Because they put themselves into so much danger thing. Yeah, I mean these guys are the punishment kings of the world
*  Yeah, and they're extremophiles in that sense now
*  what
*  What my belief is is that we are
*  It's real in the sense that the injuries the death rate skill levels and most of those guys could really fight
*  They may not be UFC level fighters, but they a lot of them come out of you know wrestling backgrounds
*  Like legitimate a lot of a very very tough. So in I think what was it in?
*  2013 or 11 John Brockman asked the question
*  What's the scientific theory that nobody knows that would make the biggest impact in people's cognitive toolkit?
*  And I just been allowed to answer this question along with like actual legitimate people and so I was kind of like
*  Being very protective and my wife said, you know, you could give a lot of answers that question
*  But that's not the one you want to give
*  Do kayfabe I got this theory that kayfabe was the most important psychological theory that nobody really appreciated that
*  in some sense professional wrestling is light years ahead and
*  Understanding how the human mind actually works because of the issues of that deception
*  And so I wrote up kayfabe which is going to determine wars and presidential elections and then sure enough Donald Trump comes
*  directly out of WWE
*  Like he really understands if you look at that fight with Vince McMahon
*  Yeah
*  Donald Trump into its professional wrestling and it is a superpower
*  Jamie can I ask you to bring up Weinstein and kayfabe and see if
*  2011 what scientific con concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit
*  Eric Weinstein, so I thought it was gonna be thrown out and in turn in fact that turned out to be a very prophetic prophetic essay
*  Well for sure once Trump got into office
*  I mean that is an excellent point of what he does is that there's a part of his appeal is that he's speaking in
*  He's like he's hitting a certain frequency that provides comfort and it
*  narrows the boundaries of what's possible and puts things into some very
*  digestible form that morons love
*  You know I'm talking about I'm not saying that all people that are Trump supporters are morons
*  There's people that support him economically, but there's a lot of people that are morons that like him because he's talking in this frequency
*  He's he's he's there's a narrow band. He's not gonna say anything crazy. That's like self-deprecating
*  or
*  introspective or he's not gonna prepare you for the great beyond or you know
*  include you in his
*  Concerns for the demise of civilization and Western values. He's not that's not in him right right. He's got a bandwidth
*  He's got a very narrow band and inside that band. He's the king ratings are tremendous tremendous
*  Everyone's doing a great job. We're doing a great job
*  He says these things that key they reinforce this sort of pro wrestling sort of vibration
*  somewhat I
*  Have to admit that I don't meet many morons
*  At all just come to comic store more often
*  Let's back up
*  I'll bring your else more. Oh sure Joe you don't even believe that
*  I think that in general people when they are given no choice at all express themselves moronically
*  When they give a no choice at all yeah, I want a choice of an actual president. That's viable
*  I don't have one so then you're gonna ask me well which which of the non viable people do you like best?
*  This is the this is the real issue with the Democratic Party they've essentially made us all morons
*  Yeah with this Joe Biden thing they really have
*  Who do we need I mean I
*  Can't vote for that guy. I can't vote for him. I can't vote for him. I can't vote for Trump
*  There I'd rather vote for Trump than him. I don't think he could handle anything
*  I mean you're relying entirely on his cabinet like you want to talk about a an individual leader that can communicate
*  He can't do that and we don't even know what the fuck he's gonna be like after a year in office
*  The pressure of being the president United States is something that no one has ever prepared for right the only one who seems to be
*  Fine with it is Trump oddly enough. I mean he doesn't seem to be aging at all or any sort of decline
*  You know Obama like almost immediately started looking older. Yeah, George W. Almost immediately
*  I think that this is not a change in Trump like Trump in a weird way. It's just always been this right performative
*  You know like a fake alpha right and he still plays golf all the time like he hasn't switched up muscle
*  I mean, I'm sure he switched it up a little bit because of the pandemic because he's apparently a germaphobe which is hilarious
*  But this is this could be his demise
*  You know, I mean isn't that kind of hilarious. Yeah, that might be what does him in the guys always been worried about germs apparently
*  How does that work with his
*  Active extracurricular life, I don't know. I guess he wears condoms
*  I wouldn't have I wouldn't have imagined stormy Daniels would be the person that he would have chosen first then it just it's very strange
*  She was a hot lady back in the day. Well, it's not a question of that. It's just that she was also an active one
*  Yeah, if your key issue is transmission, I mean, I'm not judging anybody. I'm just saying as a as a vector of communication
*  Yeah, that's true. That's a good question. Of course the porn industry weirdly has
*  Very high health standards at one level because it would have to right. Maybe that's his rationale that they're tested. Yeah, it's interesting
*  so I had
*  Ashley Matthews on my program and I and she was you know talking to me about
*  The woman behind Riley Reid, okay, and
*  How hilarious is that? That's like that's her pro wrestling name. Yeah
*  Well, and I don't know that she'd used her name fully
*  Until we were talking and I said that I really wanted I didn't want to interview Riley Reid
*  I wanted to interview Ashley Matthews
*  How'd that go?
*  She was good. I mean she
*  It was a bit of a mismatch in
*  But she is polite and sweet to a fault
*  she's
*  trying to be
*  Thoughtful, I really admire her courage
*  She doesn't want body body augmentation
*  So she's got a non classical porn body she
*  You know chose to do a trans scene because it was erotically interesting to her even though
*  She was told that it would kill her brand
*  She doesn't necessarily sometimes she shaves her body here. Sometimes she doesn't
*  so there's a lot of
*  What she does that I think is incredibly admirable and I got
*  To know of her because she came to a show that I did with
*  Ben Shapiro and Sam Harris in San Francisco and she was tweeting out that she was a huge Sam Harris fan and
*  Then I saw something she did where she was talking about it was impossible for her to get banking and regular services as a
*  pornographic actress and
*  Banking yeah, there's like remember operation choke point. No operation choke point was I think in a Obama era
*  Initiative to try to make it very difficult to engage in legal occupations like
*  Payday lending and things or porn and so they were yeah, so they would I think they use the FDIC
*  to harass
*  credit card companies and banks into
*  Not making it easy for these people to gain access to ordinary services
*  So I've been very concerned about the ways in which these people are being used
*  About the ways in which the
*  authoritarians
*  attempt to
*  Regulate who can do what who can say what say what where get banking
*  You know, but so that's still going on to this day
*  Yeah, it's a difficulty getting banking like she can't get I think MailChimp won't work with her
*  Because she's a pornographic actress in terms of mailing lists. Yeah, and then there's like chargeback issues where marginal businesses
*  You know people will cancel their credit cards
*  But in fact if you're doing a business where very few people are canceling the credit cards
*  They'll still claim that they won't work with you because of the risk of cancellation. So there's this whole
*  Thing where we harass and and tax
*  PayPal payouts no longer supported. What is this? Jamie was this from?
*  Blog, yeah
*  We're all devastated by PayPal's decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods
*  If you have PayPal as your payout option
*  Please select a new method and update your information in your model settings tab
*  If you have a pending payment for October blah blah blah blah blah blah. So this is because of porn
*  Canadian my okay. So this but hold on a second. Is this prostitution?
*  Is that why this payout thing? I believe that once upon a time
*  San the San Fernando Valley was the head of prostitution
*  It's a head of pornographic acting and movie production because it couldn't be charged as prosecution now
*  Now Ashley makes the point that she's comfortable being called a commercial sex worker. So in some sense prostitution adjacent
*  But not prostitution and in to your question about how did that go?
*  I was quite nervous about having a
*  Pornographic actress as a guest I did it in fact right after sir Roger Penrose
*  So it was a one of the better transitions. I like it. Thank you for my next trick the I
*  Think it's important that we talk about porn and I think it's important that if this is gonna have a huge effect
*  Like dark matter, you know, you feel its gravitational effect, but nobody can actually see it because we can't talk about it
*  I think that it's absolutely imperative that we make more connection to planet porn and
*  Talk about what's going on? What does it say about us and the ways in which you know, they've got great data
*  The way ok Cupid has great data on what's going on in the world of courtship
*  porn has great data on what's going on in the world of kink of kink and eroticism and
*  You know, for example, she pointed out that incest porn
*  Surges around the holidays when people are spending time with their families what?
*  Wow, an incest porn is that is that chance is a cancer that I don't think we're even talking about that's gotten really really pronounced
*  Yeah, well all taboo porn's stepmom porn, you know that kind of stuff stepsister
*  Yeah, there's there's something about I hear yeah, but there's something about those things that for people
*  It's like there's so much porn that
*  This is the last taboo. The last taboo is your your dad marries this hot lady and then your dad
*  We have one taboo. I want you to have a good time with your mom. I'm gonna go off golfing
*  And stop. Yeah
*  You know you I think with your line
*  You could do one eye rail, right? You just did two at me. What's that the Sean Connery one eye rail lift?
*  Yeah, I can do one. Yeah
*  Something about a line porn
*  Crossing of lines
*  Don't remember
*  Sorry
*  You need a smoke pot. What I wanted to tie said you don't even smoke pot hardly
*  I wanted to talk to you about one of your podcasts. I listened to least recently you listen to a podcast
*  Yeah, controversial the O'Keefe podcast. Okay project Veritas guy
*  That's a that's an interesting one because you had a really good point in that
*  People when they hear that this is a project Veritas thing and for people don't know who he is
*  James O'Keefe from project Veritas. They've
*  They've done a lot of work exposing
*  some
*  Biases that are held by some of the people that work in these social media groups
*  Social media corporations like Twitter and Facebook and things like that
*  yeah, but the way they've done it is all through hidden camera type stuff and
*  There's a narrative that people love to use where they go
*  Oh that guy he uses selective editing or that guy you can't believe anything they say everything he says is wrong
*  But that is impossible impossible because you're listening to these people talking and they're talking about how they
*  Marginalized right-wing viewpoints
*  They look for people who have like manga and their headline and they put them in certain categories
*  Makes it very difficult for people to get their right their stuff that the algorithm supports, you know that they they know how to
*  Marginalize these perspectives and these points of view and
*  It's really weird that no one
*  They've found this strange way of describing it where even though you see it on video
*  You hear people say things
*  That should be outrageous to anyone who believes in
*  objective reality and yet
*  People love to say that's just a project veritas thing that guy's full of shit and they're always full of shit good
*  And then they they cast it aside. Well
*  Thank you for bringing that up the
*  Another look I want to take risk and that was a huge risk
*  Is that if you touch these worlds by the way, can I try one of these CBD things? Yeah, they're not in the fridge
*  This is the last one. Can you get one?
*  Tell Jeff to get some some of the CBD kill cliffs
*  They're very addictive. I'm gonna warn you right now. All right, 25 milligrams CBD. Okay
*  I have a friend who cannot come to the United States ever because he attempted to come in with some CBD
*  Which is not psycho actually from the UK come on he can't come in the US ever I believe
*  They can't appeal that and now the CBD is legal here. His mom is Amanda Fielding. Do you know who Amanda Fielding? Yes
*  Do you love Amanda Fielding? No
*  Explain who Amanda Fielding is Amanda Fielding
*  Countess Amanda Fielding is the head of the Beckley Foundation
*  for the scientific study of
*  Psychedelic and related substances in the UK who I think believe works with Imperial College. She's an older lady, right? Oh, yeah
*  And she's a she's self-trippant
*  Right. So she's right. You told me about yeah, she's put two holes in her skull and her husband
*  Lord Jamie
*  Is he Earl Jamie maybe he's Earl J. Earl Jamie, I'm sorry, I don't know these things okay
*  He's trepanned as well, oh great and they're they are two of the most lovely learned
*  Wonderful people in the world. What's the benefit of self trepidation her trepidation in general? Oh, Jesus Christ
*  There's a video of her doing it. Yeah, I think it's called something like a hole in my head
*  What is that? It looks like she did it with a stick. Yeah or something. She did it herself. She had her own tools
*  Why did she do that? First of all when you are British aristocracy?
*  This is what you do. I know you don't yes you do. How's you going vacation? No, no, no, this lady's crazy
*  Jesus Christ. Look at that fucking hole. She put in her head. So she drilled right through her skull. Yeah
*  All right. Now the reason she did it and I think it's an interesting one. Oh, please
*  Joe come on don't be judgmental
*  The belief that she had was is that her brain
*  Your brain expands to fill your brain case and that when it runs into a hard stop
*  That the blood circulation has changed and that when the blood circulation changes
*  You lose that sparkling clarity that comes from your sort of childhood
*  And so if you if you remember how clear the world was when you were a kid
*  Herbalife was by relieving the pressure
*  From the brain case that you actually get a kind of permanent upgrade in your cognition and the
*  Level at which you're experiencing all of reality. Is that true? I don't know. I'm not self-deprived
*  I have not well do the hold my head. Did she say that this was like an effective method?
*  I think both she and Jamie say that it's been very positive
*  The fuck out of here with that, well, this is a different flavor. We got a great flavor here
*  25 milligrams CBD that's crazy though. So this guy is
*  Permanently barred cheer sir without having anything yeah permanent be permanently barred from the United States. Yeah because of that
*  CBD yeah psychoactive, right? Maybe they just knew his mom was a nutjob the drills hole. She's not a nutjob
*  She was the one who changed my mind about psychedelics. She changed them. Yeah, I was a totally I was totally opposed to wish I was there
*  Show you it could be done without having a hole in your head. I
*  I
*  Said Amanda you've been taking LSD regularly. Oh, yes, since the since the late 60s
*  I said, well, how is it that you seem to be completely all there?
*  so really doesn't have any negative effects and
*  well
*  I'm trying to race through the story rather than being perfectly accurate. I said then what did we get wrong in the 60s?
*  And she said oh dosages I said, what do you mean?
*  What moronic and so people were just putting huge amounts of LSD and things and having terrible experiences
*  And I thought well, okay
*  This is completely she's crazy because I know it's acid and so I just had this image that you pour acid on a brain
*  and it turns it into eminthal or cheese with all lots of the holes and
*  Sure enough like we don't even know what the lethal
*  Dosage of LSD is right
*  At a physiological rather than at a software level
*  It seems to be incredibly well tolerated because it's the only thing that has this effect in such tiny trace amounts
*  Yeah, it's the same as psilocybin the LD 50s
*  Outrageous, you have to eat pounds of it. And so she changed my mind where I realized that I'd been thoroughly
*  Propagandized and that I had never examined my beliefs around
*  These chemicals and then in fact many of the most powerful
*  Appear to be very well tolerated. Yes. Yeah the most powerful ones in fact
*  But they're they're also the ones that most closely resemble human neurochemistry
*  So which is weird too. So I think that look I'm a fan of eccentric as are you yeah for sure
*  And I don't think Amanda's crazy. Oh, she's definitely crazy. No, she's drilled holes in her head. Oh, it gets weirder than that. What else?
*  She had a pet bird called birdie and she built a mausoleum
*  To her pet bird in the form of some sort of a conical
*  Earth outcropping that
*  In order to reach it, I think you have to
*  Walk over Doric columns
*  That cross them call like, you know these old columns
*  From Greek temples. Okay, and so the tops of them form steps across a moat and it's guarded by attack swans
*  It's like you can take nothing at all psychoactive and then you're visiting this woman visiting her bird's mausoleum
*  Being attacked by swans walking over Greek columns to cross a moat. Yeah, but that's just fun
*  Drilling holes in your head is really really where I draw the line
*  That just seems I mean, I don't think there's any real science to relieving pressure by drilling a fucking hole in your head
*  I think you're just relieved by the fact that you've taken this really radical step outside the norm and
*  Decided you're gonna be the person who drills a fucking I'm sorry. I'm team Amanda fielding
*  I well she may she may have made a crazy decision in her life
*  But does she keep doing it every now and then a new hole
*  Well, you know, it's like it's like plastic surgery you get addicted to it pretty soon. There's nothing but the right just holes
*  Yeah, Swiss cheese head. No, these are two of the most
*  Lovely and
*  Cerebral people around and she's on acid when she drilled the hole. I doubt it. I
*  Mean, I don't think she's sorry. I just I general I think she's as eccentric as the day is long, but I'm
*  I'm such an admirer of people who are willing to try to cross the adaptive valley and do it and
*  Fund their own expedition
*  Yeah, right. So this is like a giant risk
*  It's just crazy that so was her son that was a barred from coming in this country the filmmaker
*  I'm just imagine if you had a can of this
*  25-milligram CBD kill-cliff and they're like you fucking criminal get out of our country
*  But we're using these things as excuses. Yeah, like I desperately need to have Douglas Murray come to the US
*  But people don't like Douglas because of some of his opinions, but he's been here. I don't think he can come now
*  Why I don't know there's some issue was this recent he was on the podcast
*  When was he last year?
*  Once done this far years ago to maybe two years ago. Was he here in the old spot or the new spot?
*  I feel like it was the news, but it was here. Yeah, so it's
*  within two years
*  He can't come to the United States, I think he can't come to the United States and I'm very angry about that
*  and I'll tell you another one that I'm really angry about is
*  Alex Green the CEO of symmetry labs
*  Do you want to bring up the tree of tenere?
*  Tene are E from Burning Man. Oh boy
*  Said burning man. What's wrong with her? Have you been?
*  too many feet
*  Too many what too many feet too many dirty people. Okay, if you can find a video of this
*  Here's where all the masks are they're fucking hoarding them for Burning Man. So
*  Like maybe the third one to 2017
*  Okay, okay, so the guy that's beautiful so this is a tree in Burning Man
*  They've got all these yeah, and the guy the guy who came up with this is rotting right now in federal prison
*  The guy who came up with this tree. Yeah for what he's a physicist musician a very good friend of mine
*  Somebody I leave my children with
*  Great family friend wonderful
*  Passover and Shabbat dinner guest and
*  Currently in jail for weed what?
*  weed yeah, but like I want you to think about and
*  There are much better videos than this where these giant waves and things go through the people who are bringing
*  Transcendence and grace and beauty to our lives when they're hounded because of like what language they've used
*  Things that like self experimentation
*  And
*  Advocacy for psychedelics. I'm very
*  It's very important that we have rule breakers mavericks
*  People that you might call crazier lunatics
*  And that we be very gentle and celebratory. What is this gentleman's name again?
*  Alex Green Alex Green and Alex Green is was he arrested for distribution? Yep. I think so
*  How much did he have don't know where was he arrested? I think it was New York
*  New York is still illegal as weird as it may well be but my point is I
*  Want out? I want yeah, he's in federal prison. I don't know a couple few years. I don't know with parole
*  He's in a treatment facility
*  But you know I just I get a call from my the key the person I leave my children with when I go out of town
*  Sitting in federal prison, you know, it's like this call originates from the US correctional
*  and
*  This guy said, you know, he's a he's a genius CEO of a beautiful mathematical art company and
*  I just feel so powerless
*  To figure out how to move people along was he targeted or did he just fuck up and try to buy a large number of it?
*  a large quantity of it so that he didn't have to
*  Imagine that he was involved in some I I don't know the specifics of his plea and I don't want to say anything
*  That could screw him up
*  but I imagine that you know the issue was
*  Something to do with a large cannabis business
*  Okay, so he had some sort of distribution business in New York State. I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not opining that
*  He didn't break the law, but I also think at some level when you go back
*  I mean, you know when you see cannabis being advertised everywhere and you grew up in a world in which like only bad people did that
*  Yeah
*  It's pretty infuriating. Yeah
*  you know and at some point I was so angry about Alex that I started talking about coffee and
*  Wine as drugs would you like red drugs or white drugs today? Yeah, you know
*  Hey, should we go get some drugs down at Starbucks and people would be like very weirded out
*  But like tell me those things aren't drugs. They're drugs. They're drugs. They're drugs always have been
*  I only smoked cigarettes for one weekend in Turkey years ago
*  Man, did I not know?
*  Cigarettes are a drug. I was flying did I
*  Don't smoke but I have smoked before shows. Okay with Chappelle. He's giving me cigarettes and Tony Hinchcliffe
*  He's giving me cigarettes before shows and I've smoked a cigarette and then gone on stage and it's like you're you're on a drug
*  It's a cognitive enhancing drug by the way, it fires your brain
*  And then you're I'm so jittery. I can't even be definitely can do that. I can't think yeah, if you do a bunch of them it
*  There's society has accepted a bunch of drugs and a lot of them that'll fucking kill you and then they've made some drugs that
*  Are some of the most powerful drugs in terms of their force on creativity to make cannabis is one of the most amazing
*  Drugs ever do you find arms of creativity? Do you do you believe that's as true of indica as as it is of sativa?
*  Yeah, indica definitely gives you some pretty wild thoughts
*  It's it's really it perturbs normal consciousness right in that
*  That perturbation that if that's a word, is that a word? That's a word, right in that
*  Adjusting of your normal perceptions. That's where these new ideas come come in
*  that's where these new it's almost like you get a
*  Little a little a chance to pop your head off the top of the clouds and look around and go
*  Oh, this is not what I think it is. This is some weird thing
*  You know and I got really high the other day and I made a post on Instagram about
*  Joe exotic and Donald Trump and
*  Then this this thing and I was like saying like here's what's weird like
*  The thing that keeps coming to me when I get high is not
*  It's that this idea that one day things gonna get back to normal and
*  The idea is that there would never really was a normal that it was just an attractive illusion
*  And then it's a comforting and attractive illusion
*  And I used a photo of Joe exotic and one of Donald Trump's most ridiculous tweets
*  Where he was talking about the corona virus and how he's a huge hit and how?
*  Raging Joe exotic from the new Netflix documentary series called Tiger King, which must be a part of your life
*  Get on board right away. I don't know anything about it. And then the other one is look at this. That's Joe exotic. It's
*  Amazing he's a guy who smokes meth. He's married to two different guys at the same time. They all live together. It's great
*  I don't want to tell you anymore. All right, spoiler alert, but good Jimmy go Jamie go to my
*  Instagram so you could see the Trump tweet that I also included in this post with this image of Joe exotic
*  because these two things together was just like I was stunned and
*  Tim Dillon actually had sent me this this tweet by Trump and I was it's the second image of the Joe exotic
*  It is like a double post. So if you click on the image like look at that. President Trump is a ratings hit since
*  Reviving the daily White House briefings. Mr
*  Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on
*  Roughly the viewership of the season finale of The Bachelor
*  Numbers continue to rise. He writes numbers continue to rise. What are we reading Joe?
*  This is Donald Trump the president of the United States makes a self congratulatory tweet that his
*  talking about a pandemic virus that could potentially kill as many as
*  200,000 Americans just guilt revolution Joe look at this. I want to revolt
*  I can't I can't I get your I get your wind the revolt
*  I get that but me as a high person in the valley
*  Sitting on my back porch while my kids are asleep looking at this tweet. I'm like, well, I don't even think there is a normal
*  I don't think normal is real. I don't think normal is real. I think we've been we've been hoodwinked normals not real. I
*  Don't think it is. I don't think it's real. I think it's that's one of the things that I love about nature
*  You know
*  We were watching a video yesterday of an owl eating the head off of a hawk because I was explaining there was a sort of a hawk
*  War that went on in my backyard at one point in time these owls killed these hawks and I would find these headless hawks
*  Like owls are mean motherfuckers. Oh, man, they're so they look wise and kind but they are so badass
*  So mean, I know they eat the hawks heads
*  That's like the way they do it and I found this out by googling who the fuck eats hawks heads
*  I found I would find these hawks in the middle of my my yard with no fucking head. I'm like, what is this?
*  It's great owls man. They were these badass owls
*  That would by the way these hawks great recommendation from you what bunny UFC?
*  Bunny, I had never seen rabbits fighting. Oh, yeah, there's oh my god
*  There's something I tried to figure out which are the animals that I want to see fight the most
*  Yeah, so giraffes are way the hell up there. Oh, yeah, they fight wild giraffe battles are the best
*  Funny UFC is so funny. It's funnier. It's like kangaroo fighting for sure
*  Well, we didn't know how mean they were to each other until my daughter's got two male bunnies and we we left them in a coop
*  Together and like oh, well, this is not good and they grew up together
*  I mean these weren't like bunnies that didn't know each other
*  But they would fight to the death and they would fight all the time. Their ears were all torn apart
*  We had to separate them. Yeah, so this is they fight all the time. They're rodents, man
*  Have you seen penis fencing in flatworms?
*  No, no, I have not penis focus
*  Okay, Jamie, I
*  Learned so much from you about bizarre animal sexual behavior all the way back to the the cuttlefish that pretend to be women
*  Yeah, yeah, that was a good one. That's a really good one
*  Okay, there's a lot of men out there like that in society. So this is a penis fencing with flatworms
*  So this is like in terms of why do people who like social engineering not like biology?
*  flat worms
*  have two different life cycles a male and a female life cycle and
*  They don't know when they encounter each other
*  and romance calls
*  Whether or not they will be male or female and it's decided by a violent contest so they've got I believe two
*  plural of penis
*  We were I let's go with P and I
*  Know I only want to see one at any given moment. They have two penises
*  and they attempt to stab each other and
*  whoever penetrates the other
*  Succeeds in what might be termed traumatic insemination and the loser is assigned the feminine gender
*  Right. So the idea is that it's more costly to bear the young than it is to pierce the opponent
*  so
*  Female is given to the loser
*  Whoa
*  So they just do battle until someone fucks the other one, right?
*  Person becomes a chick now that thing now there's a worse species what bed bugs
*  Bed bugs have no vaginal opening
*  and so make one the only way that a female can bear young is if a male attacks her thorax and
*  Breaks it open in an act which is definitely called traumatic insemination
*  So, you know you have a situation in which violent rape is the only method by which
*  Females can leave young so what they do to you when you stay in a hotel is just child's play
*  Compared to what they do to me. My point is if you want to talk about eradicating bed bugs with DDT
*  I'm all for it. They are the the feminists worse
*  Nightmare species and I you know you and I talk about the natural world look like
*  Well, they blow up like balloons I think so if you see one that's flat it hasn't really gorged
*  So they're like ticks
*  ish
*  Anyway, we had them under control I believe due to DDT and
*  But on my list of ten nightmare species bed bugs and flatworms
*  For the twin traumatic inseminations would be way up at the top so it's like a needle
*  So they they literally puncture through the thorax with a no. There we go. Oh Christ
*  Yeah, no these these are
*  If there is a good Lord
*  Boy, this does he or she have a lot to answer for yeah. What did you do you fuck?
*  Why did you make bed bugs and why did you make it like that?
*  Imagine what kind of natural selection takes place where the only way that you can reproduce is through violent rape
*  Well, it's interesting. There's a different system, which I think is fascinating which is
*  There's a conserved quantity in dung beetles
*  Where they have weaponry on their heads in the form of antlers for fighting the males and
*  It turns out that there's an inverse relationship so there's some resource that's allocated between
*  the
*  copulatory equipment and the
*  Weaponry that the that the that the bed that the dung beetle has if they have a lot of weapon
*  There goes the Sean Connery. That's good
*  I think yeah, I love it. I've tried it for years. I can't do it
*  No, I don't know if it's just a failure. Okay
*  Don't know if it's just a failure
*  The larger the weaponry the smaller the copulatory apparatus. Oh, so it's like a monster truck thing. Yeah
*  If you don't have it going on you gotta go get yourself a monster truck
*  Was like that tiny little gun invented
*  Anyway
*  So what happens is is that the size of the copulatory apparatus may be the engine of speciation
*  That when a
*  male's
*  Equipment no longer fits the female that may be the cue that some dung beetles will speciate because they can't reproduce
*  Effectively and we don't know why
*  the conserved quantity would be spread between fighting equipment, which is used only to displace rivals and
*  the
*  Size of the package when I went on a tour of the Vatican I
*  Had a really great guide it was really cool. He took my family through this thing and he was
*  he was a professor and he was
*  Really happy that I was so curious about things. So and I was on an edible
*  And so we're wandering around
*  Billions of dollars of stolen art and one of the things I kept saying I go why are their penises so small like what's going on?
*  With that and he was like that's a really important question and he's like back then
*  the thought was that
*  bigger penises were brutish and that they were that these you know, you got to realize these are people that were fending off barbarians and
*  The idea was that their gods would be beautifully proportioned, but they would have these
*  small sort of
*  less dangerous
*  Penises, it's very interesting. Yeah. Yeah, they would they would
*  Make them like that on purpose
*  They were all they all had little dicks all of them and I'm like these guys like if you looked at these guys
*  Like just the way they're built. Yeah, the reality is most of them would have hogs
*  Right. These are heavily muscled. Yeah thick thick men with a lot of testosterone
*  They would have big dicks most likely right?
*  That's the reason why women find that build attractive probably other than the fact that it's gonna be the person who'd be
*  Successful at protecting you from said barbarians. Well, I think isn't true that the castrati
*  Of Italy were sought after as lovers. They could still perform
*  Really? Yeah, but then you didn't need to worry about pregnancy. How could they they could get erect?
*  Yeah, but when they were castrated, that doesn't mean any sense. Is that wrong? Yeah, I don't think that's correct
*  I think they're eunuchs. I think that's why they would do that to men
*  I mean men who would work in castles and they would have eunuchs that would work with the Queen's eyes
*  Well, I don't know what what the definite what?
*  Operation was performed on the castrati
*  Okay, but I believe that there was a way in which they were sought after as lovers
*  Maybe they just ate a lot of pussy. Maybe that's probably what it is. What just kind of lingus
*  Yeah, I actually think that they were able to set I'm not sure what operation was done
*  But I believe that they were able to sexually perform in a conventional way Jamie and if you could find the plural for penis
*  It's got a pen I yeah. Yeah penises just sounds so fucking crude
*  Well Dix is real that's the right way to say it cocks a lot of cocks yeah, you don't say cock I
*  Might start
*  Do you know the the Michael Jackson story?
*  I know some this is one of the Michael Jackson stories that I was promoting before it actually was
*  Confirmed by his doctor the doctor that wind up killing him and went to jail. I
*  Was like the way that guy sings because I was aware of castratis
*  I'm like he sounds like one of them. Yeah, he sounds like he has this permanent female voice
*  Well the doctor that went to jail for sedating him and when he wound up dying dr. Jackson, right?
*  Right, whatever the guy's name was
*  That guy confirmed that Michael Jackson was chemically castrated by his father to preserve his voice
*  And they did it to him at a young age Wow, cuz when he makes sense well in retrospect
*  It's like the end of the usual suspects like a hundred percent makes sense
*  If you look at the rest of his family look at Tito or germane, they look like men, right?
*  They're these thick men like a normal man. Yeah, and then you look at him
*  He's incredibly slender like he has no muscle at all and he moves
*  Like he's got this, you know, there's this dance style
*  That is like quasi feminine almost right it's like
*  he's
*  singing like a woman like it's like why why
*  Tell him that it's human nature. Like what is that? That's not a male voice, right and hits incredible notes
*  Well, the idea was that his father wanted to preserve
*  What got them to the dance? I mean, this is a performing entertaining family
*  He was the number one he was the genius
*  I mean just yeah. Well, you know what else?
*  Do you know that okay? Here's what weird one the rivalry between the Nicholas brothers and I think the Berry brothers
*  Do you have your of the story? Who's the Berry brothers?
*  They were two dancing groups
*  And the Nicholas brothers were just in terms of riffing off this Michael Jackson brought back the Nicholas brothers
*  The Nicholas brothers if you can find this
*  were
*  Maybe two of the greatest dancers ever. What year is this? They came out of probably like the 1930s and 40s
*  And like Fred Astaire and Nareyev and all these people just thought
*  These are the guys. Oh, yeah
*  Oh
*  I am so
*  These I think that may be cab Callaway even yeah
*  I believe that is and just in terms of like the femininity the elegant
*  Nature of these guys and both of them geniuses and they could do anything
*  Yeah, they're incredible look how great they dance my god
*  Look at oh my god
*  The way he's moving his hips back and forth and his legs go sideways like what incredible control
*  They just say how much I love being an American. I
*  Love all the stuff that comes out of this country and I we need to get back to being ourselves
*  What are you talking about? We're being ourselves right now. No, we're not we're not. What are we doing?
*  Well right now we're looking now if you check out look at this castrati
*  We're also supposed to be great lovers. They could last long says Tomasini
*  To say that name Montesquieu. How do you say that to Montes Montesquieu?
*  describe they would have inspired a
*  Taste for Gomorrah in
*  People whose taste is the least depraved what and when Casanova fell in love with a castrato
*  Who conveniently turned out to be a woman in drag?
*  He asked her to dress as a castrato in bed. Okay, I'm done check, please
*  For those women for those women who choose as Dryden put it
*  to in quotes in soft eunuchs place their bliss and
*  Shun the scrubbing of a bearded kiss. Yeah, they wanted someone who eats a lot of pussy
*  Affairs were idolized and safe but bed hopping could be risky for the castrati
*  One was assassinated by his lover's furious family and another who wrote to the Pope
*  Requesting permission to marry on the basis of that his castration had been ineffective
*  Received the reply let him be castrated better. The Pope said no
*  You can't get married. We're gonna cut your nuts off better. I'm gonna do a better job
*  All mouth and no trousers castrati had more fun than you could think. Hello guardian. It's a great fucking
*  Samantha Ellis meets a singer who wishes he'd had the chop. Oh great. Yeah, there's good luck. Well
*  See this might just be a story
*  You know what I mean?
*  The guy says I regret not having been castrated go get castrated here's something crazy
*  That's that's one of those things where that's just that might be a story like a good way to write something
*  Maybe you know and click Beatty and it's a story. It's been around for a long time
*  Here's something you may not know the last
*  castrato
*  Was recorded see there's actually a record. We played it on this podcast about a dozen times. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty gross
*  It's not good. He wasn't a talented one
*  Well nuts not what's gross was gross is the thought that this was a child that was taken and castrated and then forced
*  Live this life. Look, it's it's it's absolutely ridiculous. But getting back to Michael Jackson, I think there is is that right? Yeah
*  Alessandro more chetchi more set more ski more s chi more s chi
*  Alessandro more s chi the last castrato
*  Christ the complete Vatican recordings. What did they do that man's mouth while they had him there?
*  So what I was gonna say about the Berry brothers is the Berry brothers were a rival team to the Nicholas brothers
*  And did we see with those guys the Berry brothers?
*  Nicholas brothers. Nobody remembers the Berry brothers. If anybody remembers anything, they remember the Nicholas brothers
*  Okay, but the issue was that the Berry brothers were there's the Berry brothers. Oh
*  That this is
*  You'll see that they're much more athletic in a certain sense and much less refined
*  So doing a lot of cane twirling. Yeah, but if you go to the end of this one, I believe it's pretty awesome
*  Look, I mean
*  There's a scene where they you see those stairs, mm-hmm
*  They're about to do something. It's Christ. Look at that. Yeah, Oh spinning and then drop it into the splits
*  All right. Well, keep keep keep on this so they're running up the stairs
*  And
*  Then oh my god. Oh my god
*  They jumped off the top of the stairs, which we're talking about a good solid ten feet and they landed into a split
*  All right now that that's a nut-smasher. Okay
*  Look at that. Look at that. Bam. That is insane that they do that three of them and then they did backflips, right three of them
*  My god, that's a very impressive feet that's like that's like parkour, but you never heard of these guys with a ball slam
*  No, but I mean, it's like the 1920s, right?
*  Well, this is gonna be later than the 20s. Was it? Yeah, god damn it's 30s 40s
*  Amazing the way they jumped off the top and land like you ever seen the hell's a bopping sequence
*  No, put in hell's a bopping. This is this just a bopping
*  Hell's a bopping and then dance
*  Um, how's a bopping dance?
*  Hell's a bop. Yeah. Okay. Now go into the middle of it because there's a bunch of setup here that no farther
*  Okay
*  Jesus Christ, oh my god
*  So this is a guy and a girl and so he throws her over his back. Oh my god
*  I mean these people can do anything. Whoa
*  But the amount of practice and how you would practice something like this the real thing that would be
*  Insane to practice is that jump off the top into the split was
*  man, it's athleticism
*  artistry and I means and
*  You know
*  This is also
*  It's incredible. Oh my god, it's pro wrestling
*  my god, I
*  Mean what is the well, we should be listening to the music but we'd get no don't do that
*  but it just I want people to
*  Wow be aware of the level of artistry and skill that came out of places like hard Harlem
*  It's just all of this is pure American engineering
*  This is 41 and you know, these are hard shoes with like slippery soles that oh my god
*  Was it what's amazing is that these guys can get any traction to do any of it and the girl just did that to him
*  Holy shit. This is the best the best
*  Right
*  my god
*  You know what I love about this program Joe is is I get to take stuff like this and blow it out to people at
*  Like millions at a time. Oh, well, that's what I love about having you on
*  I would love to learn something about this. This is a me
*  How the fuck my god, I'm not great get them in the balls and set him flying
*  Oh my god people on YouTube watching you have to Google. Oh, okay. Please do. Yeah, please do this is insane and this is
*  1941
*  My god, right and if you want to think about like partnerships between men and women and the way in powers
*  This is passed back and forth between people of equal abilities just astounding. Well, yeah
*  I mean, there's no one person who is
*  The head of this like he's throwing her
*  Like oh my god, that's amazing all they did
*  Wow, oh my god, that's incredible that they can do that
*  Wow, that's one of the more amazing things about computer technology
*  Like the the footage that they did with World War one
*  Where they took some of that footage and colorized it and smoothed it out and you know use computers to sort of fill in the
*  Choppiness of it and it's almost like have you seen my friend Lee?
*  You should have Alicia Lee on the show Rosebud AI is going to make models
*  a thing of the past she can generate like tens of thousands of people who've never existed and you can't tell the difference and
*  Like you know how that your optometrist says is it better like this or like this right testing?
*  Yeah, she could create for you. You're absolutely perfect
*  You know visual mate and there's no way of having this person or asking them out because they don't exist
*  And there's no way of telling whether they're real or fake. So it's
*  Increasingly, I just can't what is her name? Yeah, Leisha Lee
*  Leisha Lee. Yeah, she's a PhD in like math or statistics from Berkeley and again one of these people who can do absolutely anything
*  art dance
*  programming
*  Programming high-level theory and so her company is Rosebud AI
*  No
*  She she's also an actress
*  Wonder woman Jesus one of them, huh? Yep, well, I'm confusing people one of them confusing people
*  But it's unclear whether
*  Models will still have a job. They won't good go to work skinny bitch
*  Become something more interesting than just a hanger
*  How about that so
*  What are their episodes of my of my pocket
*  Launched it off of this one. Yes, I listen to Werner Herzog. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. Although he's a little bit self-congratulatory
*  Which is a little shocking but he is the most interesting man universe. It's a very interesting guy
*  Yeah, he's also been in some really terrible movies like he was in that Jack Reacher movie with Tom Cruise
*  The best part about that movie is that he drives a Chevelle
*  1970 Chevelle don't know about this. You don't know about 70 Chevelles. Did you listen to the bread up?
*  Brett episode Brett Weinstein. Oh your brother. No, I did not listen to that one. Okay, I've only listened to
*  Five or six
*  If you listen to episode
*  19 which is the bread episode. I think that's been the most important one and except for the one released today
*  That
*  Sounds like you gear me up for the one released today
*  Well, I would start with the I would start with the Brett one and what's so important about the Brett one
*  The Brett one is a story about his prediction
*  That all the laboratory mice that we use from the major supplier, which is the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine
*  May have been compromised by their breeding protocols which allowed the telomeres to radically elongate and that we thought that these
*  Mice were representative of all mice and that they had radically elongated telomeres at the end of their chromosomes which appear to mediate
*  the level of mitosis that can happen during
*  histological repair
*  So if you imagine that your cells can divide a certain number of times if if there isn't a counter
*  That stops the number of divisions everything can become tumorous
*  And since you have like 30 trillion or 100 trillion cells in your body, it means every cell
*  Almost can kill you
*  So it appears that the reason we may die from senescence that is aging is that?
*  That's our anti cancer mechanism
*  So if you eliminate like infectious disease like viruses and insult from you know being hit by a car
*  the two things that you have in the end is
*  either you die from immortality which is cancer which where cells can divide an infinite number of times or
*  You die from the recursion limit which is how many times the cell can divide called in biology the hay flick limit and
*  Brett predicted from first principles that what we thought about mice
*  Which is that they have radically elongated telomeres was only true for laboratory animals because all the laboratory animals in which we test things
*  Like drugs have been broken. They've been broken because of selective breeding. Yep, because the breeding rotations
*  privileged much younger mice
*  And removed all sort of threats from the environment and so because telomeres are not protein coding
*  there are sequences of nucleotides that repeat as a counter rather than coding for a translation in the ribosome
*  into amino acid sequences
*  What you have is is that the body can?
*  Mutate if you will and to use the Jackson Laboratories concept of this very rapidly
*  Because it's not building something structural. It's just a question of do we have 17 on the end or 170 on the end?
*  Because that it's acting
*  Nucleic acid has multiple ways in which it can participate in regulating
*  the body's responses
*  so in fact the
*  breeding protocols
*  Constituted a novel system of selective pressures that destroy the efficacy of all of our laboratory animals potentially. Holy shit
*  So he predicted from first principles
*  He said I bet if you test wild type mice rather than laboratory mice
*  You'll find that their telomeres are not long as you believe and this was actually carried out by Carol Greider
*  Who did not acknowledge the prediction? She didn't acknowledge the prediction. You should listen to the show
*  Why did she not acknowledge the show listen to the show?
*  Okay, it's it's a okay. It's no because it's it's it's this is serious
*  And it's a Nobel laureate on the other side of this so we're taking some risk over the over there at the portal
*  That's really interesting. So
*  the consequences of this could be grave
*  Could be that so much of the studies that are predicated on these mice tests are
*  They're useless. Well, I've called up the Jackson Laboratory and asked them when have you had any changes in your breeding protocol?
*  Are you they say we don't even count the number of telomeres the telomere length
*  I said you have a history of when you've changed the breeding protocols. Are you aware of these articles and
*  She said like what I said, you know these articles of Carol Greider and they said how do you spell glider like the plane?
*  I said Greider like the Nobel laureate
*  and
*  How do you spell that?
*  g-r-e-i-d-e-r and
*  So and then they said to me well we don't remember if we've changed the protocols
*  I said you're producing laboratory animals
*  I would imagine you would have a documented history of every change in the time series of how these animals were prepared
*  Well, I don't know if there's anyone around from that time it's like
*  Are you kidding were you absent the day they taught science who are you?
*  You know, this is like a single point of failure if true I can't even we've been at for 20 years
*  We've been trying to get an answer as
*  20 years
*  That no one will break the story
*  I mean this episode which is almost impossible to listen to because at the beginning of the episode I'm absolutely
*  insufferable to Brett because he won't tell the story he's afraid to tell his own life story. Why won't he tell a story?
*  Because in academics the idea of some punk kid alleging that they predicted in a telephone call to a Nobel laureate
*  That if they would test wild type mice the telomeres would be radically along
*  Radically shorter than the elongated telomeres of the laboratory tests and then the person refuses to acknowledge
*  That such a prediction was made even though we have emails from the lab
*  That so she refuses to acknowledge it or she doesn't I cannot find a single I've been over the literature
*  There is no mention anywhere
*  Of
*  And I live this with bread in real time. So I I know the events were happening. We have
*  communications with that lab
*  Since
*  There is I cannot find any
*  acknowledgement from the Johns Hopkins University laboratory that this
*  Interaction ever took place and that because he called and wrote and did not write an email
*  He did not have a paper trail of that prediction now there's
*  Consequential consequential emails that show the interaction between the labs
*  but
*  How many times have you ever heard anyone predict a molecular result from first principles in evolutionary theory?
*  This is what Brett was supposed to be famous for and then you know
*  He became like this obscure professor at some ridiculous college and then this thing happened to him
*  But that's not his origin story. His origin story is that he is the badass of biology
*  Who was able to make this prediction from first principles and may have advanced the theory of why we have to die
*  balanced between deaths from immortality that is tumors and
*  Deaths from recursion limits that is telomere mediated hay flicks hay flick limits
*  So what if anything has been done since this information has gotten out
*  The world went crazy for the episode and there was silence everywhere inside of what I've called the gated institutional narrative
*  Because to acknowledge it. Yeah, they really have to throw out how much research we don't know. I don't know
*  But it puts the question out how much research is compromised by the lab laboratory breeding protocols and breeding rotations
*  From a single point of failure at the Jackson laboratories in Bar Harbor, Maine
*  Wow
*  Episode 19
*  And you will hear me in a way where you will just say Eric is the biggest dick
*  I've ever heard in my life, but it's all to push Brett to actually talk
*  You should have him back on the show to talk about it's it's killer. I would love to yeah, so he just wants to
*  He kind of wants to soft dance it. Is that what it is soft step? He's just wrong. I mean, here's the problem
*  There's a point after which I'm not mr. Nice guy and I'm just like adamant
*  Brett is simply wrong
*  It's a it's a result and a story that needs to be told if there is another side to the story
*  We need to hear the other side of the story
*  and
*  My goal is to have Carol Greider say, you know what this interaction did happen and I probably could have handled this better
*  Because she has work that she's done which is beyond question
*  Some of the most important work that has nothing to do with anything Brett has done
*  But it does not give
*  that laboratory the scientific right to deny the existence of this interaction the
*  Importance of the interaction and because there are potential downstream consequences in pharmaceuticals
*  we need to have an answer and every answer is interesting like if the laboratory mice having
*  Radically elongated telomeres is not a problem in some way. That's fascinating
*  How could you have an animal that has this huge adaptation to the laboratory?
*  not
*  Affect things that would be interesting if it does affect things that's fascinating
*  Well, especially if you're if you're running tests on it that have anything to do with telomere, right?
*  Well, no, but if it doesn't have to do like for example, let's say you have a really toxic substance, right?
*  And it causes a lot of cell death that requires histological repair
*  Well, if you have huge long telomeres, you're gonna have an ability to
*  Metabolize that toxicity very much better, right?
*  Right, you'll be able to take the insult that comes from this and so these mice are probably preternaturally
*  Disposed towards radical histological repair
*  That's why they remain youthful and young and if you test something that might be you know
*  If you're doing toxicology studies, it could be that the telomeres even though you're not testing the telomeres
*  What you're actually doing is picking up that these broken mice are like the world champs of repair
*  But they suck at cancer. They all die of cancer all of them. Yeah almost if
*  Essentially all the mice that with radically elongated telomeres let go long enough all die of cancer because they're they're tricked out
*  For one special thing which is we're covering. Yeah, we are the best at repair
*  Right. So think about it as the theory of death and then clear away all of the noise
*  There are two ways that that nature can't figure out and escape from either you die of immortality, which is that
*  You think all your cells want to want to live forever
*  You know, and that's a huge death a huge danger or
*  we call it a resource leak leak in computers or
*  They die because the only thing nature can figure out to do is to say you only get a finite number of cell divisions
*  Up front now that there's some adjustments to the theory
*  But if you only get it like if you if you look at the moles on my face, which are
*  People love to comment on the comment section. They probably started as a runaway
*  Replicative process that arrested at the border of the mole
*  In order to keep that from killing me
*  Alright, so we have cells that go rogue all the time
*  But then what happens is is that there's some
*  Means of making sure that the process doesn't take down the entire organism
*  But think about 30 trillion assassins as the cells in your body all of which might kill you at any moment
*  it's like terrifying and
*  today's podcast
*  today's podcast so first of all
*  You can reach it now I finally got a website which is Eric Weinstein org and
*  I told you that we have to leave this planet and
*  that
*  It's hard not to laugh sorry, it's just hard not to laugh but you're serious I'm definitely leave this planet
*  We have to leave this planet. Why why do I have to well this one?
*  Because we can't all be this plan has the best beaches
*  This planet this planet also has China Russia Iran and the United States under ridiculous leadership
*  There's lots of reasons why we have to leave this planet. We're not good stewards. We're not wise enough to stay on this planet
*  We went through this and by the way you pointed out this quote which is we are now
*  gods, but for the wisdom and that became a meme so that was very interesting the
*  I I gave these lectures I think in 2013 and I was the best quotes ever isn't it?
*  Who originated that quote
*  I
*  Was me that was you yeah, when did you say on your program what day?
*  Which one remember which one you've probably turn into a clip. I'm trying to think about what it just came off my tongue
*  And you it's one of those ones where I'll drive down the street, and it'll pop in my head like the nice person
*  No, no
*  No, it's it's a fantastic quote, but it's so right. It's like every now and then someone can get the whole thing in a sentence
*  We now gods but for the wisdom
*  So that's why we have to get off this planet diversify because there too many people have godlike powers
*  Like Donald Trump commands a tremendous amount of godlike power thanks to our physics community
*  Well his ratings see how high they are
*  So hard to stay out focused sorry okay, okay, so be so too much godlike power, right?
*  So the best hope that I can come up with and it's a slim one is is that if we could figure out
*  What goes beyond Einstein's theory?
*  The Einsteinian speed limit might be bendable or breakable
*  Because we would be in a framework that was larger than Einstein's people often interpret
*  This is what they call FTL or faster than light travel, but that's not what I mean necessarily
*  What I mean is is that the underlying source code gives us opportunities that we don't normally have so
*  Seven years ago. I tried it release
*  I tried giving these lectures at Oxford which is probably the university that is spiritually closest to what I care about
*  Because they care about geometry and physics and they're in a relationship
*  they've kept the face with a faith with that tradition through people like Roger Penrose and Michael Atiyah and
*  I
*  released this theory of geometric unity
*  Or
*  Rather I released the video of the lecture that introduces this theory. So this was the first time since
*  1983-84 that I talked in public when I started this program when I was 18 19 something like that
*  And I just released the video today on our YouTube channel
*  And it's the video of you giving this discussion, yeah, so it's introduced by professor Marcus de Soto who has
*  Richard Dawkins old job as the Simone professor for the public understanding of science
*  And he just he met me in a bar and he got me a little drunk. He said, okay
*  What are you really working on?
*  and I told him and at first it sounded crazy and then he started thinking about it and
*  He asked me more questions and he brought me over to Oxford. He got me an appointment had me talk to him
*  He got me an appointment had me talk to their experts and then he decided that he wanted me to give these what he called special
*  Simone lectures and
*  They are an attempt to go beyond Einstein to look for a
*  Unified theory of physics between the two major branches that have resisted unification now that's usually in the modern era
*  confused with the idea of quantizing gravity, but the quantum gravity imperative is a
*  It's a political program that comes out of what would have been the quantum field theory community before it became the string theory community
*  which the idea is we have to take Einstein and make him submit to the will of bore and
*  I don't think it's exactly like that
*  They don't I think they got it wildly wrong and they synchronized themselves and sort of took the field off the cliff and they weren't
*  Able to ship a product that they couldn't deliver on any of this promise
*  And so when I saw that they were about to go off a cliff I switched fields
*  as an undergraduate into mathematics and
*  used mathematics as a stalking horse to study the same sort of underlying structures, but not to get swept up in the politics of physics and
*  I had this theory which I can now talk about for the first time in like 37 years or whatever it is and
*  Like today's the first day that I'm sort of free because I've kept this to myself
*  So if you want to ask me any question about geometric unity, but why why did you keep this to yourself?
*  Because I don't trust these people
*  You don't trust these people in the same like I know there was some people that have written some article wasn't Sean
*  It's not them it's an entire system that believes in peer review it believes in forced citations
*  You have to be at a university. You have to get an endorsement to use their preprint server
*  It's too few resources too many sharp elbows. Do you think that there's
*  There's a logic to that method no, I think to preserve it from charlatans and yeah, you have to do that pot sitter
*  Yeah, they just want to publish stories. Yep. So this way you have to be sponsored makes sense, right? Yes, but it
*  Whatever I'm doing whatever mistakes I'm making
*  Assume I assume I'm wrong about it, but this theory that's just fine
*  I'll find out that I'm wrong. Give me the layman's version of the theory. All right first time ever. Yeah
*  Do you know that let's start off with Escher's drawing hands
*  Mm-hmm. So do you Jamie do you have a picture for that?
*  The key problem that we have in a fundamental theory that people don't think about is
*  Not why is there something rather than nothing? I don't think we can answer that
*  It's why is there so much that is that is rich out of almost nothing
*  And so this issue shows that if you had a piece of paper
*  Could you will into being?
*  The hands holding pens using ink to draw each other, right?
*  That problem is akin to the problem that we face in a fundamental theory
*  If you had the canvas, how would the canvas bring all of the richness that you see around you into being?
*  And what I did was I said, okay, we have to be rich
*  What I did was I said, okay, we have to go below Einstein
*  So we have four degrees of freedom, but they're not yet space and time. It's proto space-time, but before and
*  Then I said, okay that
*  Those four degrees of freedom are like the stands in a stadium and the stands somehow need to build the pitch
*  And the pitch is a 14 dimensional space. So if let's imagine
*  That you had
*  Okay, we've got four objects here, right
*  So the four degrees of freedom corresponded four objects then we need a ruler to measure
*  How much of each of these four objects we have?
*  So that would be four additional variables and then you have angles because length and angles what Einstein gave us in space-time
*  So the angles between any two objects are the same as the reverse of the angle
*  So then you can count it up and there's six angles to be had
*  So there's four degrees of freedom plus four rulers plus six protractors, which is 14
*  So there's a 14 dimensional auxiliary space and in my estimation
*  You and I are in some ways potentially having this conversation in a 14 dimensional world that we perceive
*  back in the stands rather than on the pitch as
*  A four dimensional conversation that is we are in a three dimensional room going forward in time
*  So I've called this the observer's and the observer's is
*  Two spaces rather than Einstein's one space stop right there. Why 14 dimensions?
*  because I'm saying that
*  The fields that is the stuff is dancing not mostly on
*  The four dimensions that we think we perceive but it's also dancing on the rulers and the protractors
*  So in other words if I have x y and z I need rulers in the x direction the y direction the z turn to measure
*  Things and I need a watch which would be like a ruler in the time direct
*  So those four rulers are in fact in play as well and the the protractors
*  Because like a space-time is four degrees of freedom plus rulers and protractors
*  I'm saying work over the space of all rulers and all protractors as part of where these particles and fields can dance
*  So the rulers and the protractors are part of the system
*  Not just a choice of particular rulers and particular protractors
*  So by choosing particular rulers and particular protractors
*  Einstein is grabbing a tiny filament of the space of all possible rulers and protractors
*  So in effect space-time is recovered as the act of the observer's contemplating itself
*  That's a little bit poetic
*  That's a little bit poetic but I mean that the choice of a space-time metric inside of the space of all metrics is a section of a
*  14 dimensional bundle over a four dimensional space
*  now
*  That's the first sort of mind-bending weird thing is is that this is not happening in one place
*  It's happening in two places in x and in y the stands and the pitch
*  There are things that are happening in the stands and there are things that are happening in the pitch
*  So, you know when a guy's like trying to make a free throw and everybody's waving their giant noodles trying to get him to miss
*  There's an interaction between what's happening in the stands and what's happening on the floor
*  and then the observers is the bundling of two spaces and
*  Saying hey, you're confused as to what's going on here
*  Some fields are happening in the stands some fields are happening on the floor and they're everything feels as if it's happening in the stands
*  Because that's where you're sitting in some weird way then you've got this really crazy stuff, which I think
*  One aspect of it is everybody in theoretical physics is looking to figure out whether there are three or more
*  Generations that is copies of matter everything in this room is generation one
*  It's all made up of up quarks down quarks and electrons
*  So that up quarks and down quarks give you protons and neutrons and electrons give you the sort of interesting
*  Personality of the various chemical elements. They're also neutrinos, but they're streaming through us. I'm not gonna count them and
*  That's all generation one of matter
*  So everything in that think of that is like plastic Lego and there's another Lego set made out of wood
*  And then there's another Lego set made out of like lead
*  You know, and we don't see those other two Lego sets except if we're doing very energetic experiments
*  So there were three copies of matter and everybody was trying to figure out three or more and I thought maybe it's two or fewer
*  And so one of the aspects of this theory is is that the third generation of matter is an imposter
*  It looks like this generation of matter in terms of its particle personalities
*  But if you were actually to heat up the system, it would unify with a bunch of particles
*  Nobody's ever seen before and so there are predictions for what those new particle properties would be
*  There's also a fourth pseudo generation of what would be called spin three halves matter
*  Which is not prohibited but has never been seen as a fundamental
*  So it makes predictions for the particle properties of new spin half and new spin three halves particles
*  It attempts to say that there are sectors of matter that I think decoupled that the universe is not in fact left-right
*  Asymmetric, which would be called chirality
*  And if you think about the weak force
*  So if you have a new neutron on a table, it'll decay and I think something like 17 minutes on average half-life
*  When it decays there's an asymmetry in that decay called beta decay and
*  That was found by a woman bring up Madame Wu from Colombia and the cobalt 60 experiment
*  So in the 50s this this gal Madame Wu
*  Who should have won a Nobel Prize?
*  Discovered that when cobalt 60 decays through beta decay the electrons come spin out one side and not the other meaning that the universe is like
*  Marilyn Monroe or Cindy Crawford having a birthmark that lets you tell the left from the right
*  So this is like the ultimate experimental badass who never got recognized fully
*  And she did an experiment based on work of Yang and Lee
*  That for the first time showed that the universe had a preference of one of its left over its right if you will
*  I don't believe that preference is fundamental. I believe that there's another copy of matter
*  That so the analogy I give is that if you think if you look at your three fingers in the center of your hand
*  Your middle finger, which is my favorite
*  Is obviously symmetrical about itself your digit ratio two and four is pretty close
*  But is determined by the amount of testosterone you're exposed to in utero and
*  Then your thumb and your pinky are wildly off, but you could try to make it symmetric and say well
*  You know a pinky is like a lame thumb, which it isn't if you're just looking at your hand
*  You're trying to figure why is my hand asymmetrical?
*  But you don't realize that you've got another hand and it's thumb to thumb not thumb to pinky that is the symmetry
*  So when you you know place your fingertips together you see that if you didn't know if you were like Oliver
*  Sexed out and you could only see part of your body you think about the world is asymmetric
*  Well, my belief is that in weak gravitational situations this other matter decouples
*  So you only see one hand or the other and we're we're all in one handedness
*  So
*  What I'm starting to do is that I'm terrified
*  Of talking about this stuff, I don't have the right credentials not a physicist
*  I've been out of this game for forever
*  So I often say the wrong things and break rules and who knows what and I haven't really talked about it
*  This is like really a very lone. I mean I've been completely alone on this project
*  All my life. What do you think the end result of this project?
*  potentially could be
*  Because you're saying we could get off this planet
*  What do you would like? What are you talking about in terms of the actual implementation of this this theory of yours?
*  So Jamie if you could bring up
*  My answer to the final edge question, which is what is the last question?
*  John Brockman asked when the final year that he conducted the annual edge question and that is the annual edge question
*  Yes, he would ask like 200 people many of them physicists or biologists or mathematicians
*  You'd ask a question and they'd write an essay and then every year he'd publish it as a book
*  And so I did that for ten years
*  Finally got tired of it
*  And he said okay. This is my final year. We've exhausted this. What is the last question?
*  So this is the question that I asked so does something
*  Unprecedented happen when we finally learn our own source code now nobody picked up on this
*  But that's what my concern is which is what happens?
*  When the universe finally contemplates itself when we are the first like we're always worried about the AI becoming self-aware a la Skynet
*  Okay, we are the AI
*  And we're about to become self-aware if we can figure out what our own source code is
*  So we are Skynet. So you're talking about the source code of reality itself. Yep, and
*  That our percepts are limited perceptions of reality are giving us a distorted view of what the landscape actually is
*  We're I'm trying to make sure I was somewhat holding this back because I'm afraid of what it unlocks and
*  Now that I know that we're willing to elect Donald Trump not store masks
*  Play footsie with China
*  Be Putin's bitch all of this stuff
*  I
*  Tell with this we're gonna mismanage this planet into Armageddon if we don't get some grown-ups into the room
*  And so I don't know that I'm a grown-up, but I'm willing to vie for leadership by putting something up having it
*  Investigated and seeing where it goes. What is your number one fear about this?
*  This source code being I don't know what a better term mastered. Well the last time we
*  Gained some serious insight into the way nuclei worked
*  That with a little bit of geometry from Stanislaus Ulam and Edward Teller
*  Gave us the the namesake of the bikini
*  That was a terrifying moment we change everything changed in 19. I think that was
*  54 the namesake of the bikini
*  Bikini Atoll was an island in the Pacific where we blew up a hydrogen device. Is that that and
*  Those insane images where you can see the water going a mile high into the sky gorgeous
*  Yeah, is that what that is? Yeah, but they did that a lot, right? Well, they did it for a period of time
*  Yeah, and so went to your question
*  What if what so it's still expensive to create fusion devices?
*  So we don't know of any individuals who own the ability to create fusion devices if you recall at some point
*  Somebody made a functioning nuclear reactor out of discarded smoke detectors
*  And we're and got like 500 smoke detectors took out the radioactive element created a reactor really think so
*  So kid, right? Yeah
*  Probably a kid who couldn't get into Harvard
*  So we have a situation in which we don't know
*  When he ordinary humans will gain limitless destructive power, you know, try to imagine the Columbine kids
*  Weaponizing viruses or something like that. So one of the great dangers is that great power? I
*  Can't tell what the power would be if the theory is correct
*  It might give us the ability to escape it might say escape though
*  Yeah, why do we have to escape? This is what I'm always so confused about like cuz
*  Even when Elon talks about going to Mars. Yeah, like Mars sucks Mars sucks. Can you fix here?
*  Wouldn't that be the best approach? Well, you and I agree on that. Yeah what we don't agree on
*  I think is is that I am convinced that we don't have the ability to steward this place. Why?
*  Don't you think we're better than now than we were a thousand years ago? No
*  So Genghis Khan was doing a better job
*  Genghis Khan was doing a better job because he didn't have limitless power
*  Just try to imagine it try to imagine a full-on nuclear interchange and then we're having this conversation afterwards
*  so you you're concerned that
*  nuclear war is
*  Not just possible but inevitable. It's certainly inevitable given a long enough time series
*  Because all these weapons simply will become cheaper
*  There's no countermeasure that we it's too easy to destroy things relative to building them, right?
*  Do you think that when we're looking at the failure of leadership on
*  The scale that we're seeing play out because of this pandemic that this is indicative of how it would go no matter what went wrong
*  Yes
*  Yeah, like if this was an issue of forest fires if it was a an issue of climate destruction if this was an issue
*  Volcanoes hurricanes nuclear war same thing same thing like, you know
*  Here's a weird one the suit look at look at the history Jamie of the Suvius eruptions
*  by year since the 1800s about my guess is that Wikipedia would probably have a list and
*  The last one was in
*  1944 45 during World War two grounded a bunch of planes and then Vesuvius stops erupting
*  Like we're wildly overdue for a Vesuvius eruption
*  And then when Ikefala cool erupted in Iceland
*  Like we hadn't realized that the era of jet travel in the developed world had happened during an incredibly quiet
*  period of volcanic activity
*  So did we build any kind of volcanic sensitivity into these planes? No, we just grounded the fleet
*  Right and and there's a there's a volcano not so far from Ikefala cool called Ketla
*  Makes makes Ikefala cool look like a like child's play. Yeah, so
*  You have to look at the big nap as the greatest danger
*  To all of us and this point about about being Jewish is it you know to be really Jewish?
*  Ben Shapiro makes a point which is not a
*  Really Jewish jet Ben Shapiro makes a point which is not very popular
*  Which is a lot of people call themselves Jews aren't actually Jews. They're really Jews on the way out
*  People who can't figure out why they're keeping these traditions up. They sort of like to go three days a year
*  mumble a few words
*  There's something
*  Intrinsically Jewish about wanting gold bars someplace where you can grab them, you know knowing
*  Where the exits are on a building like you have to be prepared because the problem of anti-semitism
*  To leave at a moment's notice and Jews have always lived like this and many of us have forgotten because we've we've gotten soft in
*  In a world with you know
*  Knock wood anti-semitism while prevalent has been under control in the US for a long time
*  And I think we've weirdly become denatured
*  Because we haven't been living with open anti-semitism you see a crop up in the comment section of every video
*  but
*  it's incredibly important to stay in a state of readiness and
*  I've tried to keep that story about
*  Passover and the exodus into Israel from what Jews call mitzrayim which means the narrow places or Egypt
*  So my contention is the Jews had a great run
*  In Egypt and we are all the Jews and earth is mitzrayim
*  And it's time to go
*  Where we going?
*  We don't know that we can go anywhere. This is a recapitulation of our previous conversation, right?
*  We have to know whether exoplanets are viable whether we can spread out and whether or not they're in the middle of a big sleep
*  Well, they may be but if we're running a million different experiments
*  It's different than if we're running one correlated experiment with Donald Trump at the helm of the most dangerous machine ever created in the world
*  Like that was not my plan
*  So the formulation of this theory what you're trying to do is revolutionize space travel
*  No, what you're trying to do is make it possible for us in a lifestyle
*  We've been stalled out for almost 50 years in theoretical physics. So stalled out also. So the simplest way of saying it is
*  No one younger than Frank Wilczek who was born in 1951
*  Has gone to Stockholm for a discovery in theoretical fundamental physics
*  Made since like 1973
*  Physics effectively that the prestige part of physics came to an end in the early 70s when everything changed across the board
*  We had a broad economic change in our world. Jamie. Do you want to bring up a
*  GDP versus median male income?
*  Something bizarre happened in the early 1970s that we should all be talking about that almost nobody knows about and
*  One of the things that happened was is that physics effectively came to an end?
*  a lot of physicists will
*  Alright, you see that graph. Mm-hmm
*  So GD explained to people that are just listening so what it shows is from what is it
*  1947 till about 1973
*  GDP and median male income are going up in lockstep. They're almost perfectly correlated. Mm-hmm, and then abruptly
*  median male income flatlines
*  from about 1973 to
*  2010 2010 on this graph and
*  GDP keeps going up
*  Now that is people always talk about the singularity when like we will become one with the robots and AI will take over
*  This was the actual singularity that happened and it happened relatively unnoticed and that's what began to drain again
*  Median male income is irrelevant. It's just one indicator. That's particularly clean to show you that that's that's when the action happened
*  My belief is that since the early 70s very little in our society has been progressing
*  That's not true for computers. That's been like the big bright spot. It's not true for fracking
*  There's some innovations in imaging but in general in an average room
*  If you subtract off the screens, you can't get definitely tell that that room didn't exist in 1973
*  Because we stopped growing we got crazy because everything was built on growth everything was a
*  Scheme that became a Ponzi scheme when growth ran out
*  So we've sort of been hollowing ourselves out from that time and getting crazier and farther away from reality and we have to actually figure
*  out where we are and
*  My belief was that our economy was almost completely created by theoretical physics
*  Theoretical physics underlies chemistry. So the chemical revolutions like plastics from from the graduate
*  It gave us the semiconductor from which we do our computing it gave us the World Wide Web which came out of CERN it gave us
*  Telecommunications which use the electromagnetic spectrum gives us medical imaging from tomography
*  We don't really appreciate the theoretical physics has been the great success story of our time and the theoretical physics community is the
*  Intellectual seal team six of the world and we underpay them we they're under resourced
*  They're now completely unethical because we've underpaid them and so
*  They won't talk about their failures they don't talk about who did what they're not fair and decent because there's not enough resources
*  and so when resources get scarce people become psychopathic and
*  Like string theories are just an utter failure that we can't discuss because the baby boomers
*  Use that as well we're making huge progress while they're actually doing nothing. I mean, I don't say they're doing nothing
*  They weren't making contact with physics. They became mathematicians like a bunch of
*  Soldiers and generals who are playing war games during peacetime
*  There's it's related to what they're supposed to be doing but there was nothing for them to do
*  So they sort of went to the gym and ran on a treadmill rather than actually running marathons
*  So we have a terrible situation in that the community that powered our economy and gave us this incredible power in the world
*  Through like nuclear weapons and the rad lab at MIT and whatnot
*  Has gone into decline and
*  It's very dangerous to restart theoretical physics. So it's been safe because there's been nothing new that we can use coming out of it
*  My net my belief now is that we have to talk about a thousand-year solution to human life
*  with
*  weaponized
*  viruses with weaponized nuclei, I mean the amount of damage we can do is astounding and
*  That's going to restart at some point since the nap is now coming to an end like we're living. This is the end of the nap
*  You know three months ago we were all just leading la la, you know beautiful lives
*  Doing whatever we were struggling. We were you know frustrated but we weren't in boys
*  You think this is not something that's gonna we're gonna overcome and we're going to get back to business as usual December
*  2019 soon assume that we do okay. Okay, so we come up with a killer treatment
*  We replenish all the masks. We have vaccines
*  We all just spent how long watching our leaders tell us to shelter in place
*  Make I mean we all went through this movie
*  I
*  Don't think
*  I'm watching the conversations about open borders change. Do you want hey, should we talk about open borders today?
*  Let's just keep going about escaping the planet and your theory. Well, okay, cuz we we've taken a lot of time
*  Okay, cuz we we've taken many deviations and why do 430 all right, is it
*  Okay, so this theory geometric unity
*  Replaces space-time. So think about a fundamental theory as a newspaper story. It's who what sorry
*  It's it's where when which is space and time who what?
*  Who would be fermions that is matter electrons quarks and what would be the force that pushes them around how and why?
*  How would be the equations?
*  and
*  why would be something called a Lagrangian and
*  What this does is to say that there used to be two origins for
*  For physics there was space-time which Einstein gave us and then there's this thing called su3 cross you su2 cross u1
*  Which comes from nowhere that anyone knows?
*  What is that? Well you and I are seeing each other
*  through photons
*  Photons are scattering off us and being perceived in by our eyes
*  Photons are associated with electromagnetism and there is actually a circle at every point in space-time
*  So here we are in space. My fingers are up here between us. I'm gonna snap at a particular instant
*  At that point of the snap there was a circle as
*  There is a point a circle at every other point in space-time that we do not perceive that generates all of electromagnetism
*  So call this the mysterious u1
*  We don't know where this u1 comes from why is there a hidden circle that generates the electromagnetism that you and I use
*  To make visual contact that we use to send electronic signals like our Wi-Fi
*  Not only is there a circle there's also a three-dimensional object called su2 and an eight-dimensional object called su3 and
*  effectively
*  Su2 generates the weak force. That's not quite right. It's called actually weak isospin
*  And su3 generates the strong force which is sort of on the nose
*  Which is why the protons in your body don't all push apart given that they're positively charged and like charges repel
*  So why don't you explode? That's the strong force and comes out of something called su3
*  We have two origin stories
*  one origin story is the story of space and time the other origin story is the story of su3 process you to cross you one and
*  What I did was to get rid of the freedom to choose
*  Symmetries that generate the personalities of the of the particles that make up this place
*  And then the question is okay. I called it the magic beans trade because if you think about Jack and the beanstalk
*  Jack gives away the family cow to get beans which seems like the worst trade of all time
*  But the beans actually had much more in them
*  Than was understood and so Jack gets the better of the trade because the beans allow him to do something crazy
*  So that's what I did I gave away the freedom to choose the symmetries to generate the particle properties
*  I tied my hands the way Einstein would tie his hands and
*  Then I tried to show that you could recover these
*  particle properties
*  By trusting that the theory would self-assemble and that's the hands drawing hands
*  so the idea is that I generated the fermions on top of the space of all rulers and protractors on top of the four
*  dimensions and
*  The natural object which would be called spinners or chimeric spinners
*  When perceived on the four-dimensional object that is when you pull back the information from the second world that got created
*  Into the first from the pitch into the stands
*  The particle properties appear to be there were more or less the right particle properties of the particles that we see now when I started
*  This in the early 80s
*  We didn't know that neutrinos had mass and so we thought that there might be only 15 particles in the generation
*  And my stuff would only work if the number of particles in a generation was 2 to the n
*  So the joke when I was in college was I sure hope that 2 to the 4th equals 15 now
*  It can't be because 2 to the 4th is 16
*  but then
*  Luckily for me
*  Neutrinos were found to have mass and that sort of changed the probability that there are 16 particles
*  So this is some weird thing
*  to
*  Deal with the fundamental incompatibility of the two theories general relativity of Einstein and
*  Quantum theory of Bohr and Dirac
*  In the 70s we found out that there was a geometry that governed the
*  Bohr-Dirac part of the world called Erasmus geometry from Charles Erasmus
*  Analyzation and Einstein had used Bernard Riemann a German
*  Mathematician his geometries, so my gambit and why it's called geometric unity is that the two branches of physics
*  Are derived from two geometries so rather than saying it's about quantizing geometry
*  Which is the quantum field theory imperialist perspective we Einstein must submit to bore
*  The real issue is that there's a fight between the parents that is Bernard Riemann and Charles Erasmus
*  Now we don't know those names nearly as well
*  And so my goal was to say is there any world in which these two geometries and the advantages of these two geometries
*  Could be made to play together and in general there isn't
*  But there is one case in which it works, which is this issue of natural spinners
*  And so the whole gambit was to say what if the world is not a generic world, but a very
*  Natural and peculiar world where certain games work that would not work in a generic situation
*  So what I tried to do is to recover Einstein the way Einstein tried to recover Newton from a more fundamental theory
*  And the incompatibility is that Einstein had to compress something called the full Riemann curvature tensor
*  Which is the sort of measure of how warped something is
*  So he broke that beast that tells you the warping of something into pieces
*  He threw one of them out called the Weill curvature
*  And then he adjusted the properties of the other two that were left to create general relativity
*  So my thing does that but it also has another property called gauge invariance
*  Gauge invariance is the sort of sine qua non of the particle theory and this is only possible in very limited
*  Circumstances and the gambit was what if the world is in that tiny class where this this game can work
*  So it's sort of a career suicide theory because if it doesn't work this way, you don't really get anything in the end
*  So, you know think about that exhaust vent in the Death Star
*  This tiny little vulnerability and man you better hope that thing goes in
*  What are you trying to do with this
*  But by releasing this with this this discussion this video that you're putting out are you hoping that
*  more people examine it and try to actually implement it and then ultimately
*  this would be something that allows people to
*  To do what to do to revolutionize space travel? I don't know
*  I
*  Didn't know whether I wanted man to have his own source code
*  So I was divided this is but you were serious about this and this is like very close to
*  I love you came on this program and I said it straight. We have to get off this planet
*  We made a joke about getting high and all this stuff
*  but
*  I've always been dead serious about what I'm saying. Now if you ask me at a personal level I
*  Started this for lots of personal reasons
*  Always thought that the idea of wanting to go beyond Albert Einstein was something everybody would grow up wanting to do
*  It didn't occur to me that there was another thing that you would want to do with your life
*  Like that that seemed like the most natural thing in the world. I want to understand why we're here
*  Well, that means you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. Yeah, you found your niche
*  I found my niche and and then it started this kind of completely bizarre thing because I was it was not a good math student
*  But I had to go to the best place. And so how does a B minus math student in high school?
*  Go to Harvard University with a master's degree at 19, you know
*  It's like just sheer will because I was not a good math guy. So I just willed it into being I got myself there. I
*  Taught myself whatever it is that I do. I don't have an advisor, which is very unusual
*  And I became intertwined with this this theory and this theory has been
*  Separating me also from people. I love in the world that I'm in
*  I've never known whether I'm crazy or whether or not I have something
*  I don't know whether it unleashes power if it works or it only unleashes
*  Destructive power are you willing to have conversations like debates with detractors or critics of this? I'm willing to have
*  discussions with
*  constructive critics construct and in fact
*  I've done well because publicly you have you said privately fact privately. Yeah
*  Privately fact privately. Yeah, I mean I've talked to people like Nima Arkani Hamed at the Institute for Advanced Study
*  Who I just think is fantastic. There's another guy named Louise Alvarez Galmay at the Simons Institute
*  So very hard for the average person to follow but I think it's not about the average person
*  I understand that but I'm saying I think it would be incredibly valuable just release it for the average for everybody
*  Yeah, but I mean this conversation
*  I know you're saying it's not for the average person but just to have it
*  Available to everyone so if they want to they could slowly go over it and try to understand it bit by bit
*  And put it together. I should talk about this. I'm building I
*  Shouldn't even say I'm building it
*  There is a fanatical community arising around the portal for what we're doing that's different and
*  There is a 24 7 discord server where people are talking like if you're ever bored or lonely
*  These people are always on and I'm never that bored or lonely. It's not for you, baby
*  But we've been trying to recruit a bunch of artists
*  Because I believe that art is part of the secret weaponry of pushing out
*  Like I don't think you know how crazy was when we did the hop vibration up here
*  It was like close encounters all these artists start creating hop vibrations like I went to Temecula in the sky
*  Nico Nico Myers has a huge hop vibration in his backyard coming off of this program
*  It's like when people tattoo your face on their arms, right? I'm aware of all this stuff
*  I just choose to shut the door. Oh, I'm I'm I'm in there with them. Yeah, you can do that. Good luck
*  Well, cuz that we're smaller
*  That's true. It is that too, but it's also
*  A lot of what I do requires me thinking on my own
*  I have to be by myself and spend a lot of time staring off into space. Yeah
*  Yeah, I and me too. I but what I'm saying is is that when it comes to people following the story. Mm-hmm
*  Artists and computer people are going to help us push out
*  aids to
*  Like can you pull up Eric Weinstein org
*  There's a visualization that's sketched in the door there's a portal in the website
*  Okay, so go down alright you see that door no, yeah
*  Don't know why that's the clip they took okay beyond that there should be something okay right here
*  This is a picture of a fiber bundle and the path lifting property relative to a connection so those floating planes
*  That was what generates electromagnetism called horizontal subspaces and you're actually looking at a gauge theory
*  In that picture and so what you're saying is that what's valuable about the artists getting on board with this is that they can make?
*  a visual interpretation of this that can be
*  Cartoons like there's a guy named if you had Grant Sanderson
*  No, he does a show called three blue one brown
*  Which is some of the best math videos you've ever seen gorgeous stuff just sucks people in
*  And you like you're learning relatively hard math that somebody's made visually beautiful. This guy is a national treasure
*  And I'm hoping to get grant on the program
*  You know we've been experimenting when we had Roger Penrose in the program
*  I said I'm not going to talk to you about quantum consciousness
*  I'm going to talk to you about twisters and about your contributions to the field and what my community did is they built
*  Something called like the portal dot wiki. So if you bring up the portal dot wiki, there's an entire
*  Ecosystem that's digesting what happens in our episodes
*  For the lay public. That's not one of the more amazing things about
*  The internet and about something like your podcast is if you build it they will come
*  You know you have a bigger audience. I will say that I think I have the world's best audience these guys
*  Like you go to go to go down to episodes or how many episodes have you had so far?
*  Is it 28? Yeah. Oh Eric Lewis by the way, you should have in the greatest pianist now playing in my opinion
*  So if you if you like if you go to or go to the graph wall
*  I love that you're doing all this and yet you still interviewing porn stars and James O'Keefe. Hey, we want everybody. Yes
*  I'd love to hell with this cancellation. Yes. Well, not just that
*  I just love that you're just a curious person that actually wants to communicate with people on top of being this
*  Space man. So for example, we have this graph wall tome project where we start off with this paragraph from Ed Witten
*  If you go down
*  You'll see that they're figuring out how the paragraph from Ed Witten
*  Fails over into this wall that was chiseled in Indiana limestone in Stony Brook, New York
*  Which has all of these below that?
*  So that's the paragraph that tries to sum up the universe as we understood it in the
*  Modern era in prose and I recommend everyone read that and then if you go down from that
*  There's this plant right right. Yeah, go to go. There's a clickable thing under that beneath that graphic
*  So for example, this is the plan for this sculpture that Jim Simons
*  The world's greatest hedge fund manager paid for and if you click on any one of these things these ruins
*  So it's like the uncertainty
*  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle my people are digesting everything that we say everything that we point to
*  and
*  Helping each other understand what goes on on my program so that I don't have to spend all the time in the shallow end
*  So like it's just this is heavy shit. Oh my god
*  But this is what's interesting is your joy learn this from you actually you said cuz like I didn't think this was a smart idea
*  at all and
*  People are people are so eager to break into what's next
*  We want to spin our crystal crystal is and become the butterfly that we were meant for tired of being caterpillars. Yes
*  Yeah, I know you're hearing 5m EO DMT, but that wasn't what I was thinking
*  No, that's I mean, I really think that that what you're showing
*  I mean that that is a branch of what humanity is trying to do with creativity with with
*  Curiosity with the the thirst for innovation. That's it
*  Well, it's time to go to the next level and we are trying and the funniest part is like brought to you by athletic greens
*  and theragun
*  Pulled the good products. Yeah, but this is the funny thing about sponsorship
*  You see my grandfather was a salesman
*  And so in a weird way I'm living a romantic dream of connecting to my grandfather who sold like used clothing and clothing door-to-door
*  he was a shmata salesman and
*  I
*  Been astounded at how much I enjoy all of the products that I'm advertising
*  Like the sleep pad that cools you so you don't wake up in a pool of your own sweat unbelievable. It's great
*  I've lost 17 pounds through
*  Athletic greens. Well, you've also stopped stuff in your face with stuff. You shouldn't eat right? No
*  Only athletic greens. No the point you are you know in your face looks there
*  It is but in part it's because it I figured I had integrated into a program where intermittent fasting started paying off
*  Listen man, we could talk forever, but I have to wrap this up unfortunately, but I'm gonna watch your video
*  And then I'm gonna watch it high I'm gonna do two
*  Okay, watch it twice and I'm gonna try to figure it out and Joe at some point
*  Let's just hang out and I'd love to like just show you exactly what it is
*  Tailor-made to whatever questions without any worry about yes about and
*  Let's do that. I can't wait and I just wanted to say thanks again for everything
*  But you do now owe me two appearances on your show
*  I haven't called either of them in and thanks for calling me on your show. Yeah two on your show
*  Yeah, my show. Well, sorry on my show on my show. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay, you got it. All right
*  I owe you two. You're the best. Thank you, sir. You're the best
*  Bye everybody. Wait one thing what?
*  Eric Weinstein org, please sign up for our mailing list so we can find you after the yeah, go get your mind fucked
*  Good luck. Good luck everybody
*  Thank you, brother. All right. Bye everybody. Stay safe
