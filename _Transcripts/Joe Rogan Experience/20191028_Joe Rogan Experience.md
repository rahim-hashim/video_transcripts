# JRE MMA Show #81 with Dave Leduc
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 28, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1mo5D3UF7s)
*  Three two one what's up Dave how are you alive bitches yes?
*  You wanted to say that I was just playing on it
*  Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me dude. I watched you fight a bunch of times online and
*  Lethway is probably one of the most brutal combat sports in the world and it's so interesting watching a guy like you
*  You quit Kevin Kwa is that what you say you're good. Yeah, oh, yeah French. It's not bad
*  It's terrible
*  I don't know anything in French, but how do you how do you go from Montreal to being the king of Lethway?
*  Yeah, it's it's a crazy journey man and like like in a way to it was
*  We go there. Let's go there. Yeah, basically when I was I was played baseball. I was a baseball
*  I was a pitcher in Pennsylvania. I was like doing a bunch of like university baseball
*  traveling team and then I got into
*  Like a fight with my father I shout out to my father this fight with your father
*  It never went physical. Oh, but it was like going very hard and they said like my both my parents said they've
*  Pleadly, please leave like that. You're like you're kicked out of the house
*  1718 Wow, so like I had no money and I was like like almost like industry
*  It was minus four Fahrenheit. So for you guys like minus 20 degrees Celsius
*  it was like like okay, I call my friend like come pick me up and I couched her for a few months and
*  Finally got a place got my shit together
*  But then I had like a fire, you know, we didn't we didn't speak for many years now
*  We actually have a good relationship now
*  But so then and I believe that nothing good comes out of comfort, right?
*  They car chance so I was I was I had a lot of like I said fuck baseball
*  That's like I wanted to fight because of that. Yeah, I guess so crazy
*  So because of getting angry at your dad, that's what made you want to learn how to fight
*  It's like a resum√© and maybe like that a little bit. I hope it doesn't take it the wrong way
*  But yeah, I had worked out so you shouldn't take it the wrong way
*  I mean it all worked out well true and then actually funny enough. My first love was grappling
*  I was I did like a lot of competition like no gee
*  I get I want some like in gee like but was mostly no gee and then I actually had my league called the SFL
*  It was like a submission fight league once a month. I had guys
*  Organized I was or I was only I was not fighting. I was just organizing it and got the guys fighting and
*  Submission only not IBGF. Just where was this in Quebec in Quebec near Montreal
*  So then we're doing this and then I said my coach my sifu sifu Patrick again
*  Shout out to my coach. He said I said I'd never want to do anything other than grappling
*  He said well, you're tall and you know, you're good reach. Maybe you should consider. I know I don't want to do
*  I only want to do no geez like okay
*  He lets me do my shit and then yeah, eventually I started I started doing like I come from Santa background like
*  Son yeah, right, which is a style of martial arts. Yeah, so Chinese martial arts all the army in China does that mean much
*  And it's pretty cool. So wide stance spinning attacks, you know and cool stuff a lot of throws
*  I was actually with conley in San Jose. No shit. Yeah, we did some nice headbutt videos
*  Oh, wow, we need to do one together after all right
*  Good headbutt before I've no not really and their head but of the person on the pads
*  I fucked around, you know and hit head but of the bag, but just joking
*  Never I've never like I've seen your pad routines where you incorporate head butts into the pads
*  Yeah, it's I feel like you fight like you train
*  So if you don't if you don't train it how the hell you're gonna throw him in a shower has to become do a lot
*  Of people headbutt pads or are you I'm teaching them now. Okay, you see you originated it. Yeah, I've never seen anybody do it
*  Yeah, I mean I've seen people headbutt people in fights particularly in the UFC the early days Mike Mark Coleman when he was the heavyweight champion
*  He was the godfather of ground and pound big gigantic wrestler, and he would take guys down get on top of them
*  It didn't matter if you were in the guard he had but the fuck out of you
*  I mean when they took away his head butts, you know because they changed the rules they took away
*  Fucking 20% of his game 20% of his game. He'd control you have
*  Slam his forehead into your nose. You know you couldn't see then he'd pound the shit out of you, okay
*  I mean that was one of the ways he became the check it out from the UFC
*  They took it out of the rules
*  Which I don't totally understand why if you can elbow in the face and the eye sockets and nose
*  Why can't you headbutt? I don't know it's cuz a headbutt cuts elbow cuts
*  And you actually can do way more when an elbow and so knees knees cut as well true
*  Yeah, I think I think it should be legal. I think so too. Yeah
*  You do yeah, you're excellent at it. So how did you get?
*  Explain the path to let way. Okay, so now we were basically at the doing starting to striking
*  So then I do a couple fight nights and I love it. I start fighting but then it's legal in Canada
*  You can't do like folk even Muay Thai is illegal. So I don't know why Thai's illegal in Canada pro Muay Thai. Yeah
*  What yeah, no elbows. Yes, I'm a true. How come the UFC is legal. Tell me about it. Oh my
*  You can do MMA but you have to do headgear and shit for Muay Thai Wow even in France shin pads
*  I'm not sure but there's no elbows. No elbows. So amateur Muay Thai no elbows. Well, that's not Muay Thai then
*  No, it's not. Oh, that's crazy. Even in France
*  I think Muay Thai like Thai fight when you go there to have head elbow pads really? Yep
*  What sunshine was fighting with elbow pads last?
*  San Chai with elbow pads hilarious in France. Yeah. Wow
*  And then what else and then basically I
*  went to Thailand for the first time cuz my friends were there and
*  Just easier because Myanmar was like for those who don't know it used to be called Burma and now it's Myanmar and it was
*  Super hard to get visas and you know a bunch of things stuff like that
*  So I go there I do my first pro Muay Thai fight cuz and I was I was like partying and I was I want to
*  Get a fight. So you give me a fight. I win. How much training had you done? You did Sanda and what else?
*  well, the sand and grappling and
*  Yeah, so basically like no Muay Thai no every day Muay Thai before my first move
*  What it was a brawl it was crazy, it's not beautiful to watch but yeah
*  Wow, how many people could say that I never did Muay Thai before my first Muay Thai
*  But I got lucky I got a nice elbow in the clinch claw and cut him up right here
*  So you started thinking about elbows that that's my elbows now
*  Yeah, but like just to back up a little bit
*  Basically my coach see food back told show me back then a black belt magazine
*  Burmese boxing probably the same that you saw sure and then I like I want to do this right and starting watching videos
*  But there was nothing it was like black and white. It was super hard to find
*  There was nothing about that way
*  So I just put it on the ice but my dream was always to go to Myanmar one day
*  But at the time I know Tiger Muay Thai was super big. It's like easy fights every week
*  He was you visas like you don't even need to get a visa. It's 30 days for Canadians right away
*  Really? So I was like, okay, my friends are there
*  They invite me to Tiger and I have a good relationship with them now
*  basically ended up winning their tryouts and
*  I do it was a big year that year. We had like Dan Hooker myself
*  We wanted like Alek Rostowski was there
*  Peter Yan so all the guys were oh, yeah, so it was yeah good fight and and then I was like I was for me
*  They were free MMA. I was for Muay Thai. So we got a scholarship
*  So look, you're still following me. Yeah, and then and then I go to I get that little like I mean
*  Thank you for giving me that room guys, but it was like a shitty room with a toilet
*  It was a bed and a toilet, you know, but I'm happy at the time. I had no money, you know
*  I just like I'm happy. I'm happy with this we had like actually my wife is watching right now
*  We had like a call that the the black hole in the toilet
*  There was the you mean AC was leaking and it was so like it was so disgusting
*  There was like we called it a black hole. It was a mold. Oh, that's terrible for you. I know tell me about it
*  Yeah, that's stuff some some of that mold can be toxic, right? Yeah, and my wife was not very happy about it
*  I'm sure they weren't testing that mold either
*  So then we get this and then like I remember like it's yesterday we're on the bed and
*  like I'm making one fight a month in Thailand and
*  I'm you know, it's like I'm telling I actually got myself in myself in the maximum with I tournament
*  It was I was trying to get my name, you know in the Phuket Stadium and the Phuket circuit
*  Mm-hmm, and then and then
*  One time like with a manager pulled me out and he's like you're not good enough because they wanted me to be super stadium-like
*  You know check block check block and I'm not I want I was wide stance. I was super I was catching kicks punching back
*  I was not like like they want me to do at all not good for gamblers because gamblers they want you to they start gambling
*  A second round and I was knocking I was winning like a first round so they don't make money with me
*  So they wanted you to for people don't understand what we're talking about in Thailand
*  It's traditional that the fighters fight slowly in the first round
*  They just sort of feel each other out once the bets are all in place
*  Then they go hard in the second and third round
*  But a lot of fighters would go over there, especially from other countries and just fuck people up in the first round
*  Yeah, and that's what you did. Yeah, and they didn't like me for that
*  What did they tell you to do?
*  They tell you to slow down the first round. They didn't tell me anything just pull me out of the tournament and say you're not good
*  enough. Not good enough. Yeah, and I was winning. I was winning fights
*  Yeah, so that's how I'm starting to get pissed a little bit and then
*  I'm making shit money and I sold everything that I had that I had at the time to go to Thailand
*  So I'm like a bit and you know, like hardship like I'm like, what am I gonna do?
*  And then I meet Irina and my wife now we're married by the time we were we were just together and
*  She said I wonder what have kids we're gonna buy you have kids with $200 a month
*  You know, like you need to say what you're making for a fight
*  $200 a fight in the book is seems like 10,000 but sorry 6,000 but it's disgusting
*  Wow, that's what people get like even for a whole month. So you were living off 200 bucks
*  I was getting in debt. Thank God. I had credit before coming to
*  Burning through that shit too. Yeah fast 50 bucks a week. That's kind of crazy
*  Yeah, I was I was spending it like $500 a week. So I was I was getting that pretty fast Wow like fast so
*  By the time you know, and I'm like, okay, what am I gonna do?
*  So we're like we're crying on the bed. My wife is like, you know, I believe in you you can do whatever you want
*  I think you're you know, you can be champion. I said I don't want to be just champion anywhere
*  I don't want to be I want to be champion and like the most brutal shit in the world
*  It's like but let's wait was like it was almost unattainable at the time
*  So lean to people the rules of that way because we keep talking about it. So let's head butts no gloves
*  Take downs allowed so suplex to the spot on the head elbows to the back of the head. They don't care
*  You know take downs allowed so soccer kicks soccer kicks not I mean, yes the body but you can sort of on the
*  Way down yeah, you can kick him in the head. Can I the body lock and on the way down you head butt?
*  And then you get back up the referee doesn't care a lot of times is that a rule though?
*  Is it legal? It's a great line great line a great area
*  So you can actually do it take down and then drop the knee like knee stomp and then it's okay
*  Yeah, they say that basically you're supposed to help her brother up
*  So when you fall down you help him up and you see you fight
*  So the mentality is like we fight for 15 minutes and if we punch each other in the face a face with hell elbows
*  Headbutts and everything and let's see the first who quits wow, but then if you go on the floor we get up
*  They want action back, you know, even though I loved I loved the ground
*  I think it's true that on the fight I understand on the feet is more exciting
*  So it's easier for people to understand for sure. Yeah, especially for people that don't train
*  They always want stand-up fights true. So you how did you wind up going over to Myanmar?
*  So okay, so just again, I I got myself I watch a vice documentary on prison fight. Okay, look at that
*  That's hilarious
*  So the prison fight thing another that's again for it's for in Thailand for those who don't know it's sanctioned by the Thai
*  the partial Department of Correction and
*  They didn't do I was on the last one ever in 2014 and basically
*  It's inmates fighting foreigners and if the inmate wins the the sentence is reduced. Whoa. Yeah, have you heard about this?
*  No, okay prison fight. Yeah, I did that and we were so basically we go into maximum security prison outside of Bangkok
*  maximum security prison and
*  It's like a movie man, like they made a movie actually about it recently I was on the real deal
*  Yeah, and I was with my Turkish friend. We go there. They take her away with phones. Look at that big metal door
*  We go underneath I have goosebumps talking about it and then we go we see 800 inmates
*  They're all they're all there for the either rape gang rape murder
*  Drug trafficking and they're all they can get their sentence reduced if they win a fight
*  What if they win two fights one guy actually it was on it was on Showtime
*  They did a documentary on Showtime and he actually won the finale
*  He won against an American and he got released a murder one
*  He won he was he actually what I heard I'm correct me if I'm wrong
*  But he went he was in a bar and somebody like talked about his girlfriend or touch his girlfriend
*  He went back
*  He took a knife and stabbed the guy in the neck and he got in prison for that for murder
*  Basically, then he got out for fighting well fighting very well
*  Oh
*  That part of the world
*  With a squeamish stomach
*  So he was but actually those guys there they do some mistakes, but he were fighting in Lumpini
*  They were they were like high-level guys, you know, really? Yeah, maybe not like all champions
*  But they were like they knew how to fight hundred fights in up. Yeah, so I get a guy who was there for
*  trafficking men and fitment meth
*  it was like ten years and
*  basically
*  Me actually maybe you know and barbara's honor of he fights in glory and he was actually
*  He fought for the belt against
*  He actually lost at the belt there recently
*  We were me and him at the time he was not in glory at the time
*  we fought there and
*  Only no me and another Iranian won the prison in the prison fight and what are the rules?
*  So it's it's a three round fight that Muthar rules with gloves with big pillows
*  It else so at the time again, my goal was always to go to Myanmar
*  So look look at that
*  So basically after this I go back to Canada and I'm like my head is like I don't want to be in minus four degrees Celsius
*  you know and
*  minus 20 in Celsius, so I'm like how can I go back to Asia and
*  so I go to I go to I go back I save money I go back and then
*  Losing my thoughts basically I when I when I get that situation with arena right? Well, we're like we're like we're stressing for money
*  we're stressing for the future I
*  Called up the prison fight promoter and and the time I said you have a fight for me like I need to get money
*  I need this. No, he said well, I don't promote Muthar anymore. I promote let's way you want to get you want to fight
*  I'm like yes, that's my you know, I've always wanted to do this
*  So he's like well if you want I have this guy's to to to to he's an undefeated champion
*  Let's we rules 36 lights to to to to to
*  That's his real name
*  He was undefeated in how many fights 36 fights
*  That means it's all KO right cuz traditional let's way it's K only to win. We forgot to say that really there's no there's no point system
*  No points. No, how many rounds five rounds? So what happens if you go fire on?
*  Whoa, but you're fucking the dude up. That's what happened Wow. So yeah, so basically I go I said I don't care
*  Let's fight I want it because you just it's my dream
*  So he's like well how many fights you have well, I have ten with I fights you will or Muay Thai
*  Well, he's you know 50 fights in let's way and you have ten fights in Muay Thai
*  Well, let me let me do something he lied on my record. He said I have 40 fights
*  Okay, and then I go over I go over there
*  I'm like, I don't care cuz my coach Sifu Patrick and I we were always
*  like, you know, I gouging and
*  Like practicing that's the mentality of it like rest safety like fish hooking in the clinch or something
*  No, no, but I mean you could probably I fish hook if
*  Probably probably I mean they don't care really really? Yeah, but as long as you know, I pokes, you know, right
*  So anyway, so I was always ready for that. I wanted that that aggressive
*  fights so
*  I go to the fight and some kind of energy comes in my body. I don't know
*  I don't believe in that stuff
*  But like I just disfigured him like he didn't touch me much. I was using my my push kick to the ties
*  I was keeping my distance and then I went inside
*  I use my elbows and I like if you see the fight it's it was it really puffed up like it was pretty cool and
*  then that was my first fight and the crowd like
*  They were throwing bottles a little bit. Why were they throwing bottles cuz they're he's their champion
*  yeah, yeah, but then they quickly saw that I did my my lick amun, which is the the
*  challenge gesture, you know very old challenge gesture and the
*  They loved it so they started what is how does that work?
*  So basically before the fight you put your arm like this and you you so explain to people that are just listening
*  You put one arm under your armpit
*  so yeah for those at home, so you put your left arm under your armpit and the other arm in the air and you
*  hit with your your
*  cup top cupped hand on the triangle shaped of your elbow and you
*  Three times that actually gives me more goosebumps before because that that's I trigger that to the fight, right?
*  And this is a very old gesture
*  From Myanmar from the Burmese army back in the days when they were in the trenches and they were fighting enemies
*  You challenge with honor encourage your opponents and you do that and that simulates the wing of an eagle
*  They saw you do that and they give they got fired up
*  Yeah, I understand the rituals
*  Yes, because some of the times guys were coming from other disciplines other country and they were putting their white crew
*  They were doing a bunch of other things, you know, I embraced the culture
*  Yeah, so they liked it. It's okay because at first they basically they wanted another tall white dude to get fucked by their guys
*  Sure, I mean like I was sent there to lose. Yeah, I'll send it to her. What weight are you competing at?
*  I'm 180 right now. Mm-hmm, but like most of my weight is in the groin area. I hear you
*  So but like when you're fighting those guys like what weight do you have to get down to?
*  So traditionally in let's wait the Burmese guys were never really over 180 pounds. So every
*  Every weight category as a belt there's only
*  And I fight open weight. So there was like I fought guys over 200 pounds 190 pounds. It doesn't matter
*  As long and I think it's striking that it matters less than if there's wrestling involved, right? Sure
*  Yeah, but like there's only what's it's easy for let's people understand in the twit
*  There's only one golden belt champion for each weight categories, you know, like it doesn't matter. No Bellator UFC
*  When I see there's one champion in Lithuania for it doesn't matter how many promotions and then do they have like a stadium champion?
*  Like they have in Thailand or the no no stadiums change all the time. Okay, so how what is the organizing body?
*  So at the WLC, this is the world with which championship
*  it's like the major league of Lithuania and
*  Yeah, they know they're actually gonna do I'm we're saying everything but I want to we'll be doing an event in the state next year
*  Really? Yes in the United States. Yes, illegal
*  It got you know, the first state to legalize that way Alabama Wyoming. Oh, that's crazy bear-knuckle motherfuckers
*  But not cowboys. They want me they don't give a fuck up in Wyoming man. There's grizzly bears up there
*  There's only 80 people I've never been there. It's awesome. It's beautiful. No never been there. Okay never been a good neighboring towns
*  You know our neighboring states, but Wyoming is gorgeous. Okay, but they want to do it like in Miami in Florida
*  They try to get in Florida. They wouldn't let it go in Florida
*  They're trying to get it there that would be more prestigious than doing than doing my man. Wyoming's the shit
*  I love Wyoming you're gonna get a endorsements from Wyoming because it's like it's a it's one of the last
*  Truly wild places like there's beautiful cities and beautiful homes and stuff, Wyoming
*  But it's a gorgeous state and it's got real wildlife
*  They have wolves and grizzly bears and elk and it's just like a go. I've never hunted there, but you definitely
*  Where's the best Utah Colorado's great. There's a lot of stuff Montana. I've hunted in Montana. Did you ever go out of the country?
*  Only no. No, I've never hunted in other countries if you had to go where would it be like out of the country?
*  Australia's really good. I have a good buddy mine Adam Green tree. He lives in Australia. There's a lot of hunting out there and
*  New Zealand there's a lot of hunting in New Zealand. So it's a nice trip as far but yeah Africa's weird
*  Hunting in Africa is very strange like it's got too many
*  Connotations attached to it, but there's a lot of wildlife there and it could be rough through some places. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, well it's obviously an enormous continent
*  But some of the countries can definitely be rough
*  But they there's a lot of these areas that are supported by people hunting wildlife
*  And I if I did hunt I would only be hunting things like antelope things that you eat
*  Never
*  How often do you hunt because I saw like I want to do it too because it looks healthy
*  Oh, it's the best meat in the world. I wish you were staying around here, man. I'd give you some
*  I have a freezer full out there and it's like how's the texture is like it's like a lean meat
*  It's like like venison if you ever had venison, it's very lean. You have to cook it at low temperature
*  No, no, no, it's not that chewy. I mean it's more chewy than say like a real fatty beef steak, but I love it
*  I love it's so good for your body and it's like wild. Oh, yeah, 100% wild
*  Yeah, just dodging mountain lions and trying to not get jacked by wolves and bears and shit
*  I what I I followed the nature is metal because
*  Nature's metal is the best the best Instagram. This is like
*  Kyle Dunn against the funniest and nature's metal
*  And then one of the coolest is King Lezek also, that's a pretty good
*  Yeah, right the head but but that nature's metal man. Let the I watch on one bear
*  Attack a deer and he was screaming like a human. Yeah
*  Backyard. Yeah, that's awful
*  I always show that to people that think the bears like it's cuddly little things my brother eat deers alive
*  They eat them while they're alive. I show that to people that think that we're like
*  We're over nature, you know, like yeah, like we're we're mammals. Yeah, we're a part of nature
*  We just live in cities and we're very well protected
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  but you that's one of the things that I actually enjoy about hunting is when you're out there in the wild the real wild
*  Wandering through the mountains you realize how vulnerable you are, you know when you see bears or you see even with this
*  Well, I don't bring a gun. I hunt with a bow
*  Okay, but yeah, I mean even with a gun you're still I mean if you don't shoot something or if it comes from behind you
*  Like a cat. Yeah, like a mountain lion. Fuck you up, man
*  You just you have a rifle and you don't even have one in the chamber and a mountain lion jumps in your back
*  Good luck getting
*  Racking a bullet
*  Getting your safety off and the action some day. I'm big like you there's no way you can like you can't like I poke the guy
*  People have survived by stabbing them people have survived
*  You know, there's people that have been in life or death situations with cats and they've managed to stab it. It's possible
*  But it's not likely. Okay likely you're getting fucked up. It's that's like if there's a simulation one day
*  I want to try it, you know, and you can retry emulation
*  Actually your face ripped off and with a bear to it would be nice
*  How would you see that video recently or the trainer? Did you see that? Yes. Yeah, the bear just decides
*  You know what fuck this game just
*  Just tears the guy apart that second happened in any moment
*  You're not supposed to do that with bears say hi to them. You see him. Hopefully you're in your car
*  Keep driving wave at him. Don't get out of the fucking car and definitely don't try to train them
*  Did you see one like when there are no hair? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's not the most beautiful
*  Creepy yeah, creepy looking. Yeah. So anyway, so yeah, please go
*  So we're talking about the prison fight, I believe something
*  So yeah, so I get yeah
*  I know actually we're going to I crossed over to let's wait and then I you know
*  I was giving a just to tell you how much like I really wasn't prepared that much and it's kind of a crazy
*  How it happened that my translator Burmese translator before entering the ring told me, you know
*  If you want to protect your head, but don't forget you put your hand on on his head, right?
*  I'm like, what do you mean? Is that well, you know put your head
*  So if he strikes you it's not gonna cut you and that's what I teach in my seminars, too
*  And I mean wow and I that's like literally before they call my name
*  so I go in the fight and
*  Actually stop the headbutt from this. Oh, yeah and like people at home that you know, let's say I try to you know
*  If I would put my hand on my head in the clinch, right?
*  And if you would strike on my forehead and he would he could still strike me in the jaw
*  If I put on my jaw can still go to my temple
*  But the goal is to and we can do it after a little bit like on there
*  I would put on your head so this and if you strike me, it's gonna it's gonna stun me but not cut me
*  That's the key. Yeah, but then again why it's so different in little it
*  Why is it so different is because you lose a limb that you could use for striking
*  You have to put it on the head of your opponent
*  So you have like one limb left to hit or whatever?
*  So right complete different clinch and most people when they clinch in Muay Thai, whatever they clinch they hold the biceps, right?
*  But then in the middle, there's the headbutt, right?
*  It's really cool that there's still one martial art in the world that still like will not budge that will keep it raw
*  That's that it's it's an effective technique and this has always been my problem with glory. The glory doesn't allow elbows
*  I'm like why not have full Muay Thai rules allow the clinch allow knees to the body in the clinch allow elbows knees to the
*  Face the plum
*  I mean all those those techniques are very valid to be able to cross over an elbow in the clinch
*  I mean, it's very skillful. It's real. Yeah you like yeah
*  So that's why I add elbows and then head man. That is that's another element
*  Yeah, that's the thing. So that's why I think headbutts should be allowed in MMA
*  I believe I think so too
*  and if not
*  Well, we have MMA which is like the most generalist martial art with the grappling and the wrestling and the striking but then
*  In this way, we have like the most permissive striking sport on the feet. Yeah, that's pretty exciting
*  Well bare-knuckle boxing is they've doing a lot of that in Wyoming by the way, I was in Wyoming
*  Yes, that's that's where they do it. I think that's the only state see if that's the only state that allows it
*  I think it might be one of the only states that allows it but I
*  Was a big proponent of bare knuckle in MMA
*  I was like why do you get to pad the knuckles up when you don't pad the shin and this and the elbows and it
*  Doesn't make any sense. But then the cuts
*  The truth Mississippi and New Hampshire have also recently added it but Wyoming was the first
*  Yeah, I needed
*  The cuts are huge and that's the thing but it's only hands right if you would have your legs to push him away
*  You would have your elbows. You have the headbutts you would I feel
*  It's even they would get less cut up. Yeah, I get less cut too
*  I think you know in a way actually think like if you look in general most little fights
*  I have a bit less cut than then then the bare-knuckle boxing because it's really you're just standing in front of each other and you
*  Just punch and it's right. I'm I want to be the new generation with with fighter because the Burmese actually
*  They go in the pocket and it's a bloodbath, you know scar tissue everywhere short careers. You don't fight like that
*  I don't want that. I want to go back to my wife and be a hey baby
*  So you fight well you also are very long right you're tall and long for your weight class
*  Yeah, so even though you're fighting large. How would you look six three? I'm six two six two
*  So when you're fighting these guys, do you usually have a height advantage? Yeah, and that's a good point
*  So basically people say because I took two and two to min that's another guy to in min
*  It was the legend. He was the former champ the one I defeated for the Golden Belt
*  He was the open weight champ so to two was 75 kg and the other one was open weight, so basically
*  two to min and him are both around five nine five ten and
*  So but the thing is it's actually and now after facing taller opponents like Americans and French and Australian
*  Six foot and up six foot three and everything
*  If you if you look at this like he's like five nine would be about here five ten and then the headbutt would go
*  Yeah, okay and a six and and if I want a headbutt him that's five ten five nine
*  I would have to drop my level then do a headbutt
*  But I look at slower, but if I like I fought in August you know said Basinski is like six three
*  I didn't get the didn't get the Seth Basinski fought in that way. Yeah, I didn't know that yeah, you fought him. Yeah last month
*  Second round I got him with a weave and then a hook in the pen
*  I bet I think he was he was pretty cautious of the head, but we didn't get in the in the pocket
*  So it was yeah, I was in Burma. It was a cool guy. He's a very cool guy very good
*  Yeah, I didn't know he was doing that yeah, he was bigger than me though. He's a big fella
*  He got he's not 170 anymore
*  Yeah, so is there cutting weight in left way well in the WLC now
*  They're trying to trying to put like more strict weight class and but before like I said I fight I fought open weight
*  But now open weight was very restrictive as more as the properly popularity of little increases
*  There's more big guys. I'm gonna fight right so now in WLC. I am I'm fighting cruiser weight, which was
*  195 pounds do that guy headbutting who is that supposed to be the guy on your shirt me. That's you I
*  Got that by a fan
*  It's pretty cool. No. Yeah, that is cool and like it's the same face
*  Yeah, I do when I head but you're very angry face well
*  I try to be kind outside of the ring and angry inside and we don't fuck we don't let anybody so have other
*  Like big name guys like Seth but say you know Seth fought in the UFC for quite a long time
*  I think 11 fights yeah the ultimate fighter too
*  Is there other guys at that level that are starting to make their way to left way well?
*  We actually got a message at it from Diego Sanchez Diego so fucking crazy of course he wants to do it
*  He said Dave. I'm not in UFC anymore
*  Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that oh shit. Yeah, he just
*  Dropped a scoop well Diego Sanchez not in the UFC said I'm off with my contracts
*  You want to give me a little fight in the WLC would be nice Wow
*  That fucking psycho of course he wants to do it. I think you would love it. Oh, yeah, you'd love it
*  He's perfect for it. Yeah, I'll call him too. Yeah, that's interesting, but so yeah apart from that
*  There's been like it was mostly strikers, and I had I fought Cyrus Washington. Maybe you know oh yeah sure yeah
*  Also just figured him too yeah, yeah, and we had a little bit of rivalry and he's a very good fighter very good fighter
*  But he was able he was running around the entire freaking fight. He's a shorter guy too right he was 510
*  I believe is he yeah, I'm not sure but you're a bit shorter than me
*  But yeah, he's a guy that throws a lot of spinning techniques
*  Yeah, and I was aware of that and I was I wanted to make sure that you know I keep my distance
*  But then I had I know I had a better inside game than him so I do want it
*  I want to go inside fast yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so him and a couple
*  Yeah, but the biggest name was the Burmese guys you know they're like 55 million people for people at home
*  There's 55 million people in Myanmar and their national sport is let's way yeah, and it's like a religion that is crazy
*  It's crazy. It's crazy that it's so popular there and most people unless you're a hardcore martial arts fan
*  You don't even know about it. Yeah
*  There's a lot of UFC fans probably listening to this podcast just hearing about that way for the first time
*  Yeah, and it's it's okay cuz I had like again Jim's that hosted a seminar with me
*  And he said he's a martial artist for 40 years and never heard about Lutwy Wow, so it's okay
*  We're in that transition now. You know, but then in 20 30 years when they're gonna ask hey, do you know about Lutwy?
*  Yeah, I heard the podcast
*  It's also YouTube
*  I think a lot of the videos of your fights and some other fights on on YouTube people go whoa
*  They see the the head butts and the body slams and the suplexes and shit. It just shows like what this is wild
*  There's a wild sport. It's pretty exciting. How long are the rounds? Are they normal length three three five rounds of three minutes? Yeah, okay
*  Yeah, exactly, but that's very similar to Muay Thai. Yes, but then the crazy part which my fights
*  I fought in a traditional Lutwy rules is that you have an injury timeout an injury
*  So meaning that let's say you knock me out Joe and then I I have the they pull me out in my ring in my corner
*  They slap my face. They bite my ear. They pull right here here, whatever
*  By your ear?
*  Really?
*  Have they done that?
*  But you've seen people do that?
*  Pull the hair. Yeah, you've seen them bite each other's ears?
*  Yeah, they go just like they mumble them. Just chew on the ear a little bit. Really? It hurts, no?
*  Well, I'm sure it hurts
*  But I mean what about ice it seems like that'd be a better way to do everything because let's say you have two minutes to get revived
*  Okay, so you get KO'd? Yeah, and the fights not over two minutes to get revived. Why isn't the fight over?
*  I don't know that's the in traditional back to 2,000 years ago. They want to give another chance
*  But the WLC
*  God, that's so crazy. Yeah
*  WLC is eliminating that. And I'm good with that if you want guys to have a career out of Lutwy, right?
*  Yeah, it's better for the brain. Oh, yeah a lot better. Yeah, I've seen I think only seen one time actually it was Tuntunmin
*  With I think Cyrus where actually
*  You get the only guy
*  You know you get knocked out. He went back to his corner got revived and won the fight. What?
*  Yeah, he went by decision. No, there's no decision.
*  Cyrus Washington's corner threw in the towel. Wow
*  That's really rare. So most of the time when you use your time out your outlet, you're gonna just get knocked out twice
*  Yeah, I would imagine. I mean you just had a serious head. Oh, is that it right there?
*  Yeah, show it to me in the beginning show it to me in the beginning. Nice out again. You know boom elbow here
*  Oh my god, he's out fucking cold. Yeah, look they drag him out and he actually finished and won the fight
*  That is insane. So they drag that is fucking insane
*  That is fucking insane that they oh my god, they're gonna bite the ear soon. No, they're not gonna bite
*  Yeah, don't tell me they're gonna bite his ugly. Did you drag him?
*  He's out cold and this is one of the strongest like
*  Like he was this is to zoom in. Yeah, so sit him down
*  He's literally unconscious up now. He's starting to wake up with a water. That's hard though
*  Like that's freaking hard like can think about what Jamie they just bit his ear rewind
*  Who's biting his ear?
*  They're pouring water on him. He's gonna do it right there. Anyway, anyway, just like yeah, that's the oh he tried to bite his ear
*  He really did
*  That's it. Oh Jesus Christ
*  So they just pouring water on him and they give a chance to wake up hey wake up bro, and he's that is so crazy
*  What kind of idea right there? Yeah. Oh my god
*  He's kissing him too. He's making out with them. He's like bro. I'm gonna fuck you if you don't wake up and
*  The crowd goes crazy cuz they like, you know, they're they want him to keep going
*  Yeah, it's like it's really about grit and about like heart and he goes back look after like 30 seconds
*  He ends up winning. Are they gambling here as well? I'm not aware of it. I think really a little bit
*  It's not but it's not only talent. I know there's no alcohol service
*  It's about the toy, but it's not like Thailand. Yeah. Okay. So here's Cyrus Washington
*  They put his mouthpiece in and he's aware of the rules, right? Yeah, he knows he knocked him out
*  Yeah, but then it's a it's a long time after that. So how much time it's a long time
*  Like how long I had the end of the fifth round?
*  But I mean how much time they give him a break. Oh, it's it's a minute to a break for in between rounds
*  Nobody mean why while he got knocked out was it to revive him? Is that just two minutes? Yeah
*  Oh, look at this already back to it. You know, that is it was not cold
*  That's crazy. So this is so bad. So I thought I thought both of them
*  I thought Cyrus and I thought to him in three times. So basically the oh look at this the end
*  So Cyrus just quit out. Yeah towels there like it's over. Wow. It's over. So to tell me what the fire
*  That's crazy
*  Welcome to the world of little way. Wow, but that's so insane that they revive him
*  I mean that motherfucker was out cold so to them in now
*  Like that I have a big rivalry with him
*  We had a trilogy fight with together and yeah, he's one of the strongest guy I ever saw in my life like he's
*  Like he's almost like immune to it. I don't know. He has he's tough
*  So but think about like I was watching when I when I got into the toy my coach showed me show me fights
*  I got in I saw his fights, right and I was like it's it seems so far away to go actually there
*  I was a little kid from Montreal, you know from Gatineau actually and then
*  Fast forward a couple years later. I'm fighting him for the most and this anticipated
*  Rematch in the two of history, right?
*  Like it was like the it was everywhere in this in the country live on national TV
*  It was like 30 million people watching it like almost the whole country. It was insane
*  And then 30 million it's crazy people in the huts and have a satellite and the people gather in the villages
*  They have a they don't have electricity, but they have like they don't have a running bathrooms
*  but they have a TV with a satellite and
*  Then we we fight in December last year and
*  That's actually you showed my head, but last time that was him. Oh, yeah
*  You know the head but knocked out like the knockdown that you showed. Yeah, and he said like this dude do it a lot
*  Yeah, because people were saying our head, but doesn't work like no. No. Yeah, that was during fight companion
*  Yeah, I was telling them no. No, you got to see Dave. Good man
*  Appreciate it that but so yeah, that was the head but my first head but knocked down like this
*  Like this a really I use head but I use the head to create distance
*  So let's say we're in the clinch right and you I would like point
*  I would put my forehead the hard part of my skull on the jaw on the
*  Iroita on the on the steldo on the mastoid muscle here
*  And I would just use it to push and then I couldn't bring back bring it back
*  So create space and then head but now the way you work the pads with head buts
*  Is that something that you invented? I know I was never told so I just I just started out wanted to get better, right?
*  So I started doing it. Yeah, I pretty much invented it Wow
*  I mean cannot but invented but like I started doing it
*  But you will you started actually doing pad work for head but stuff
*  Yeah, and a more refined away because they do that in Myanmar a little bit of head buzz on the pad
*  But like I wanted to know more refined way and following up with you what?
*  That flex that's so actually that's actually this neck flex is that something like the iron neck like the same sort of a deal
*  To be honest, I don't know if you're okay. Look at that. So it's a chain for weight
*  This is my lifesaver man for my neck to be honest
*  I I I used to have those, you know, the body thing in Thailand, right with the freaking concrete concrete thing
*  Yeah, but then I'm with that is so basically for people at home like a cord
*  I was always the last guy after the gym to go train my neck cuz I feel like he helped it helps per head
*  But prevention and concussion and everything definitely helps concussion prevention and I feel like if you would punch me in on the front
*  what absorbs the impact would be my muscle muscle and
*  So then I started in this but those when you when you bite a weight and you pull it up
*  It works the back of the neck
*  But then I was doing neck raises
*  I was on my on my back and I was in neck raises for the front of the front of the day
*  But then I was getting a bit stronger
*  So I was putting in like kettlebell on my forehead and like, you know
*  If you want to get stronger, but then I can't carry this biteable neck on my trips on my tours
*  Right. So then this guy reaches up. He's like well you can't break that in your luggage and then you can put a 45 pound
*  On if you want right
*  Yeah, so then I started like just doing my neck like this and I like it like it's practical then I can when I'm on tour
*  I know I can just do my neck everywhere in any gym with a weight, you know, have you ever used an iron neck?
*  No, no, I have one out here. I want you to try it because I think it's the best for training your neck
*  It allows you to rotate. Okay, so you put it on it's like a halo and it has a 50 pound bungee cord
*  Okay, you bet grapplers love it like John Jockman Chateau swears, but can you do like heavy weights like cuz this I can do like a 45
*  No, you don't do you don't do weight. No, so the idea is don't think it would be good to do weights
*  I don't know see it's it's very controversial
*  Some people think that when you're doing like the traditional I have one of those
*  Head things a leather thing with a chain like that you put a plate on it. You do
*  Yeah, I've done these but some people think that that motion with weights puts unnecessary pressure on your discs
*  Okay, so the idea with the iron neck is there's never any pressure in your disc because your neck is straight
*  Okay, you got a halo the halo sits on top of your head it forms
*  I saw a picture you pump it up so it gets tight to your head
*  But I feel like all those twisting can be a bit like not detrimental for this the disk, you know
*  You twist a lot. Just gotta try it. We'll try it afterwards. I'll show it to you. But I mean, I'm not a physiologist
*  So I don't but I've talked to people that I really
*  Respect they don't like the weight thing. Okay. Well, I guess cuz I use the weight and I feel like it like actually
*  Maybe you saw a video I did with bass did it in the LA with no, I didn't see it. I put it up
*  It was eagle throat in the neck
*  The neck is legit. I tell people that someone's fucking with you
*  Like you just grab their neck slam on the neck like that
*  But this I feel like as I'm doing more neck my muscle go overlaps. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah all this stuff right here
*  I
*  So you're so in a lot of this a lot of neck doing it every day every two days and I do the leg
*  You neck bridges as well. Yes
*  And it was back in front. Yeah, then pendulum and everything but I'm not I'm not doing like sidey
*  I'm just doing frontal because I
*  Don't risk it. Yeah
*  Fucked his neck up too, you know Tyson had to get surgery on his neck
*  It's risky the neck bridge that if you don't know well, you can hurt your back
*  Yeah, neck bridges are a lot of wrestlers when I'm fucking their neck up on yeah
*  I mean you put a lot of weight, you know
*  You see that arc and you're rolling back and forth and the thing is it's tremendous pressure on the discs
*  It's an unnatural pressure. Okay. This is the whole concept behind the iron neck
*  Okay, is that you don't put that kind of pressure because you never have like a flexation
*  Okay of the neck while you're strengthening
*  But definitely like for example when I when I let's see you buy the neck where I put the
*  Neck flex on my head. And when I do this, I feel like oh yes working
*  so I feel it's like any muscle like bicep mm-hmm build up muscle and
*  And frontal. Yeah frontal will be neck raises. Are you doing trap work as well? Do you do?
*  I'm not the biggest guy, you know, but I feel like a strong neck a strong back
*  And again for people at home when you do a headbutt
*  Why I see trainer, it's training your fucking neck. Yeah, it's it's not because I'm want to do a whip with my head
*  That's actually when it's detrimental for your spine
*  When you when I do a headbutt if you look at all my my videos and headbutts I put this
*  It's like my spine is rock solid and you use your legs. Yes. Your head is stable. Your neck is stable
*  But it's strong, but then you push with your legs to create a good headbutt. Yeah, you're developing real power with that headbutt
*  It's not just like a thump like a thoughtless sort of a thought you want to do it like a technique
*  Yeah, and then you would actually people say ah and we can talk about is about like you are if you do headbutts
*  You know, it's gonna be a brain damage. Well, first of all any any martial art any contact sport. There's a risk
*  We're not playing soccer here, right? But and even if you are soccer players get brain damage with the ball heading the ball
*  Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, let's do what we have life is short. We don't know what's gonna happen after
*  Let's do what we love. I love doing headbutts. So, you know
*  So basically when I when I I feel like if you hit with a hard part of your skull with like the horseshoe the horseshoe
*  Yeah, you know, I feel like you're inflicting maximum damage to your opponent, but not to myself
*  There's a great video of a girl or like a girl who's this fucking guy is in her face talking shit
*  Outside of a bar and she grabs his collars
*  She grabs his his collars and fucking slams her head hit to him and he goes out. It's the best hilarious though
*  This guy's way bigger than her he's just being a dick and she's like, oh, yeah, okay
*  If I have a daughter one day if I you know, I want to teach her headbutt and kick into ground
*  It's nothing they know you don't want to do the other good move. Here it is. Here it is. Watch it
*  This is a fucking hilarious video. So this guy is like, oh you see there
*  There they're in the middle of like this thing
*  let's see when when does it actually happen the guy is like pushing her and
*  Backing her up
*  Bitch
*  Fuck you
*  Yeah, she's tiny way smaller than him. I mean, I don't know what was being said, but he was pushing her and pushing her back
*  She's like you're out bitch. Love it girls learn out their head, but that girl
*  So the fence probably wakes up in the middle night when she has to pee and thinks about that. Yeah, I got that motherfucker
*  Boom that she used her head use your life to do that girl. She did it
*  Well, somebody taught her or she just has good instincts that we'll see get her a little contract
*  Do they have women that fight? Yes, sir. Yeah when actually was maybe you've heard about she was on the ultimate fighter show with Julia
*  She's a Lithuanian and she she went she went pretty far I think but she from Lithuania
*  She won the in Japan. Let's ways pretty getting pretty big in Japan. Really? Yeah
*  There's a like a little in Japan. I fought there three times in Tokyo. No kidding. Let's ways
*  Well, I know that the awareness of it is growing like what is is the internet is that what's making people more aware of it
*  So people say the internet some people say it's Dave. I don't know
*  You too. I'm sure yeah, you know that there's like a face that speaks English that you know
*  Is yeah, you couldn't see a guy you couldn't have like two minutes be in the right?
*  That's hard to get excited about it
*  Sometimes that's all it takes is like someone who crosses over becomes the best at it from another country
*  And then you can speak English clearly and so that no accent
*  Well, you obviously have an accent but clear but you learned English
*  While watching fear factor. No, you didn't I
*  Was watching it in Quebec maybe but that's not how you learned English. That's why I swear so much
*  Joking I never swore
*  Doesn't even make any sense. How many fights have you had over there? I'm over ten. It's like I choose right now
*  First my first couple years. I was doing like six fights like like four or five fights and I was getting like super
*  Like not depressed but like it was very redundant, you know
*  It's like every two months same same technique same pass session same thing same running same hills
*  It was like and I had like whoa and I was like getting injured everywhere like my elbows were hurt
*  My knuckles were swollen. So I'm like I called my wife and I called after training
*  I was like, can we just take a break like and I and now I negotiate like
*  very good contract with the DLC and they take care of me so I
*  I'm able to take we know one or two fights a year. Oh, that's great
*  So what how many fights have you had total I would say I would have to check
*  I think Wikipedia has it like maybe 12 or 11 something like that. But then yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, so last this year only fight once and so you're you're it's better you think yeah do it that way
*  I'm still like it's like a dog on a leash with a you put that I'm hungry to go fight
*  right and I actually have a
*  They fight like once every two months
*  They fight very a lot right the Burmese and I feel one guy she fights four times this month like a young young Burmese
*  fighter he fights four times like wow, but I feel like I have a
*  Unwillingly I'm happy with it, but like an ambassador, right?
*  So I have yes not only for the sport for the country too, right?
*  So I have to do a lot of other work. So right now I'm working on my online Academy
*  So people can learn let's wave your videos
*  I need to film like a lot of videos and you are really famous in Myanmar, right?
*  Like someone told me that your wedding
*  30 million people watched your wedding on television there more than that. I think but yeah, that's fucking insane
*  It was so the story that's like look
*  So now we go back to the story when we when I when I went to over after prison fight
*  I went to Myanmar then I threw after we didn't even talk about the prison fight. We kind of skipped over it
*  I mean I won like yes. Oh, it's no man. I think the more important is the let's we part
*  So then I okay, I will talk about it because that was my connection to the promoter
*  Then the promoter got gets me into this way and then I
*  Like beat up to two and then I get right away challenged by to turn in the open weight
*  So like the the best in the country when you open weight champ
*  You're the best in the world in the toy right the biggest and right the strongest
*  So he's a third fourth five generation with we fight his grandfather was a little fighter and they were all golden belts winners
*  All right, so the he's born in the like if you look where he lives, it's raw man. It's the hut
*  it's in the jungle and these is
*  Raised in the head but culture like you know, he's an animal. He's a headhunter
*  He just goes for the head and he has a good right hand
*  So I'm like and I knew right away after that fight with tootoo. I see was fighting that night, too
*  So we I go shake it hand. He doesn't know yes and no in English
*  That's how bad he is and I say good fight
*  he's like you just give me a head knock and I knew they were gonna meet so we meet and
*  Yeah, and then what was I going with this? Basically? What was your question Joe?
*  You said no just go to the fight meet him
*  I bet with the first fight just that's I think it's important to talk about this because I was
*  Only my second let we fight ever right and I'm fighting the best legends in a row. Yeah, exactly
*  Yeah, so I'm like they want to get me like oh to to to didn't get him
*  So let's get to two minutes to fuck him up, right?
*  So I go back I was I was a tiger at the time and that was no
*  I will go back to this later
*  But I was they were laughing at me because I was doing headbutts on the bags and they were it was all a big show
*  Every time I was doing headbutts, right? Like oh look at Dave doing this
*  I had to teach this guy with 300 my my my my coach at a time my pad hold at a time
*  I had to teach him how to hold pads for headbutts and that's the way I developed a bit the way to do
*  No jab cross hook headbutt elbow stuff like that. So then they were laughing. Okay, cool. I don't care
*  I'm winning fights. I go there and
*  first fight that's the hard part man, like I
*  The first round the first couple rounds are three rounds
*  He I keep I push kick his stomach and he grabs it and he sweeps my leg many times
*  So I actually sectioned my the back of my leg
*  Like it was I had to do physio like my nerves
*  I think in the back of my right leg was like fuck section section there
*  I mean, I'm maybe not sectioned but like severely damaged. Okay, so yeah section would be pretty bad
*  Yeah, so because I would mean by section. I mean like tear
*  Yeah, it was like and damage is that from kicking you the back
*  I think because he did it many times in the same spot on my the back of my knee
*  Okay, which there's a lot of nerves so he's catching your teep kick and then kicking your other leg. Yes
*  Okay, so then many times and I don't staring. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't really I'm like what the fuck like because I want to go inside
*  I want to do my elbows and I can't cuz I and
*  So then adaptation I think is key in life as well
*  I need to to to adapt and for that. So again, this guy is 70 fights, you know
*  I think yeah, like all my chaos is just smashing everyone and then
*  I
*  Started adapting I went I went to the leg instead push kick to the leg instead of this time
*  And that he couldn't catch it anymore. And then it was it was making buckle up
*  So that was a big a big thing in my you're hitting him above the thigh
*  Hyper-extending the knee and he can't get in so you he's a bold. They call him the bull
*  So he goes inside he can't you can't go inside if I'm pushing his leg too much
*  I saw he's having a hard time and he's
*  Gassing out a little bit because he's he give is usually knocks him out in the first round. He goes far, right?
*  So then I'm like I kind of I
*  Knocked him out a couple times like knocked him down a couple times at the end of the fight
*  So it was a real draw, right? It was a real draw
*  So we ended up the first fight as a draw, but then right away automatic rematch we fight you again
*  How long two months two months for that leg is fucked up. Yeah, so dad but then was it was this
*  It was an added sweetener. That was again. I'm very emotional today
*  I have goosebumps because it changed my life or Joe
*  Basically it was if you win this fight
*  it's gonna be December 2011 2016 if you win this fight you got we're gonna pay for your wedding and
*  It's for the golden belt. So the other one was only a challenge fight, you know
*  But when the when the like this was actually for like you can it's for the title fight
*  So I got two draws and now it's like title fight. So I'm like, let's go I train and I train hard and
*  Yeah, we go we meet up again and now I because I proposed you mean I proposed to arena
*  After the other fight and began by the way, if you have a chance to go there beautiful 10,000 temples UNESCO
*  protected temples and you go to 5 a.m. 4 a.m
*  And you see the sunrise on those like temples and like there's a hot air balloon. It's beautiful
*  So I proposed to arena in Russian. I learned my I learned my script in Russian and she says yes
*  I don't know how I tricked her to to love me but
*  So we go there, but then it makes the news in Myanmar, right?
*  So all the Dave got engaged in began so then the promoter calls me so hey you got that fight in December if you win
*  We you want to get married in Myanmar. I said, yeah, so he's gonna be in Myanmar traditional wedding
*  So full gold with like like I'll show you pictures. It's pretty cool
*  But I said but it's gonna be like we're gonna make an event out of this
*  So you obviously it's not stupid the guy pays 20 grand, but he's gonna make an he's gonna he's gonna
*  Yeah, I did like what they did with you know, they helped help Connor whatever like they want to build a fire
*  Sure. Sure. So it's live on TV and it's a BBC freaking everything
*  So I had a lot of pressure I had to win
*  I don't want my wife to because the wedding was gonna happen regardless, right? Like but this could be a better wedding
*  Yeah, I don't want to oh
*  That's not the most glamorous one. Maybe there's another one. Pretty cool man. This one or the yeah
*  Pretty cool. So you have Irina Terehova and
*  David Azuk in Burmese language that was pictures from BBC
*  Yeah, look at my hat. Maybe Jamie can go on the left
*  And maybe you can see the hat this one. Yeah, look I have like a hat
*  It's pretty cool. What is that hat called?
*  I don't know the name but what you see my my my skirt it's called a longy longy
*  So this Joe this is everybody in Myanmar has that it's also in India in India
*  They call that a longy in in Myanmar. They call it a longy most comfortable thing in the world you wear that
*  It's like a kilt. I have one for you. You have one for me
*  It's directly from Myanmar
*  It fits that little tiny bag. Yeah. Yeah, so you're gonna look it's like a long thing. This is directly from Burma and
*  Basically, yeah, it's so it's like a kilt. It's like a kilt
*  No, it kills would be need me up right and this is lower. This one is all the way down
*  Oh all the way down the ground and have a story for that. Okay, this actually like I don't give you
*  That's a dollar by the way a dollar. Yeah, so I don't know do these guys wear underwear under this or they free ball?
*  The commando now they wear underwear. Okay, but then the story with this and we'll go back to the fight guys. This is that
*  People wear that very comfortable
*  but then when the
*  When like war happens you put it up and it looks like it almost like a diaper
*  And you can kick because this you can't kick with this
*  Oh, I say I set up and then show off your your your leg tats because they have a big tradition of leg tattoos
*  Oh, and that's where you get all your tattoos in your legs. Yes, it come from being over there. Yeah. Okay
*  Yeah, so it is I waited I waited before having them because I wanted to make sure I deserve them
*  And basically so I like that because when you don't know who's a fighter me unless you see other face
*  But then let's say the the war was happening
*  Boom everybody gets their laundry up and they're ready for battle and you see oh, he's a fighter
*  Oh, he's a fighter. Oh, he's a fighter because the legs are tied it up got back in the days
*  Everybody had every fighter that was fighting it. We had the token. It's called. Okay. So anyway back to the fight. Yes, so
*  Because we're doing a big 101 about Myanmar right now. Yeah
*  So many things to talk about so the fight and then I started
*  I actually had a Canadian TV following me for that fight and he usually told me that they usually when we follow somebody
*  The guy never wins
*  But I was like pretty happy so I ended up
*  Get him like a take down. I'm bloody I get him with an elbow in the face
*  He's his head is like open up a pretty big gap in the head
*  He's bleeding and then I get a take down
*  but I'm using a lot of my teeth this time and like he bucks them up and I think I
*  The leg is their legs are not going too well
*  And then I do a take down and he like he falls on his leg and then he has to use his timeout
*  so yeah, they bring him back and he looks in pain and I tell my corner and
*  I'm a bit like I'm bleeding because you got me to cut too. That's that's also pretty rare
*  but I'm and and then I'm here I said which leg is it which leg is it and
*  My corner at times like it's the it's the right leg. So okay, so I'm like I could and then he the two minutes ends up
*  He goes back. He's like he looks limping a little bit. So I'm like I'm attacking the right leg
*  So I try I try to hit it but he's and then I do another take down and he's bleeding more
*  Than not long after that. It was over. He was able to get up
*  Alright, so and actually when he fell down, it is a beautiful
*  It was a pretty intense moment
*  He fells down and right in front of the Canadian the Canadian TV crew and the blood like leaks on the floor
*  And it's pretty intense like pretty cool
*  Pretty cool because I'm excited about this because like there's not a lot of good quality videos about it way, you know, right, right
*  So we have the available online. Yeah, Jamie pull that up
*  I mean if you if you go to my like, I don't YouTube or something you could probably see
*  The thing about what we're talking about
*  So this makes you the Golden Bell champion exactly. This is a giant moment for you
*  And this also spreads the word about that way in Canada
*  Well, not automatically right because it happens in Myanmar, right so and then but then the Myanmar
*  It's just becoming like crazy people and we get married live on TV two days after the fight
*  So it's like literally there cuz now they don't resent you for beating up their champion now. Well, okay a little bit
*  because he's representing the entire Muslim community in Myanmar and
*  I'm basically without even because I don't adhere to anything but like basically
*  I'm representing all like the 95 percenters which is like Christian Buddhist and like everybody else basically. So yeah
*  Yeah, they they they they were so happy. They were pretty excited because I think they knew that what was gonna happen
*  Like we're gonna promote their culture abroad. Yeah. Yeah. So they're just happy people are promoting sport. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, is it hard to find Jamie? Yeah. Yeah, if you maybe Google like new champion, I don't know, but it's
*  It's a
*  It's a so that was a big moment now when you look at the level of fighters from left way versus Muay Thai
*  Yeah, obviously, there's more more Muay Thai. There's more fighters. Yeah. Yeah. What is the level life?
*  Well, obviously the guys are fucking like everybody was like Russians prior to coming they were coming and fighting
*  It was to turn was stopping them all the time
*  If you look at if you look at all the fights, I
*  They they're they're smashing everyone bare-knuckle because people are not used to
*  For is this area? Oh, then that's not that's not one but yeah
*  That's that's one of the that's another fight. I fought a Thai guy. What happened, Jamie?
*  I took it. I was fine. There's another one the more important but
*  Yeah, the guys are like
*  They it's what I was gonna get out of you seen the level rise with all these new fighters getting into the game
*  well as
*  Like for example, that was like, you know, the lumpini champion came to Myanmar and all the like sayok
*  I don't know. You know muay thai like sayok, you know this guy. I've heard the name. Yes
*  I was like a champion lumpini champion or I think he's
*  For much I know where's a stadium?
*  Yeah
*  So he went to Myanmar many times to fight and he like he drawed with him to min and all these things
*  So he's just considered one of the best Muay Thai fighter ever right then
*  What is the difference like when when Thai fighters come over there? What what gets in their way?
*  Well, that's the things they're very technical and that brings me up to something else
*  But basically they're very technical and they do very well for the first couple rounds
*  But then when the paint threshold starts to kick in when they start to clinch and then they get ahead but they're
*  What's happening here? Right and and that's that's good that you asked me this if you look at Myanmar
*  No, and then Thailand two neighboring country. They were fighting for thousands of years old
*  And if you look at back in the days the Tong to Empire
*  I think I don't know the exact date but at that time the Burmese Empire was like all the Saudi stage or the biggest
*  Empire in Southeast Asia
*  So they were owning all of Thailand almost like Chiang Mai all these things like
*  You know, I'm not sure Vietnam and Laos all these things. So it was very very powerful
*  So that's why they say that
*  Lithuania is the ancestor of all the Muay Muay Lao Muay Thai, you know, because it makes sense
*  They were while they were owning all these colonies, right? They were dropping their seeds of their martial arts
*  So then as the retreat eventually pushed him away and they became you know, Burma as we as we go
*  We have and now they're starting a thing called Muay Boran
*  Yeah in Thailand so then but then it's very suspicious like how come you have that sport now with no gloves and headbutts
*  Muay Boran is that yeah, and you know, but you were colonized for a long time by Lithuania by Myanmar
*  So then it's basically their version of it
*  Yeah, and they added big ropes instead of doing bare knuckle Lithuania was only a bit of gods
*  They added big ropes, right?
*  So then at but I've won when the king of Thailand did a great thing for to attract tourism which removed the headbutt
*  and adding a scoring system and
*  added gloves eight ounce glove and a beautiful intricate and it becomes beautiful Muay Thai as we know very very
*  You know technical very nice, but then and then what happened is that if I let's say you're your Muay Thai guys
*  Hey, you have big ounce eight ounce glove and you by the way if you punch you don't score a lot of points
*  You know, it's it's it's elbows and knees and kicks that score points
*  so what's gonna happen over hundreds of years the guys are gonna practice their kicks and
*  They because I think the Thai guys are the strongest kickers in the world I believe and
*  Yeah, so
*  So then if you go but you grow across in Myanmar, by the way guys no gloves
*  No scoring system and if you if you it's K only to win they swing for the freaking fence, right?
*  so that's the two different type of so you have way less kicks in Lithuania because you
*  Viralize you you prefer like, you know
*  No gloves because you can draw blood right away with a punch makes sense. So yeah, it's just a history course
*  Have you thought about fighting more Muay Thai or maybe even fighting MMA or do you yeah? Yeah, but not Muay Thai though
*  No, I don't I think I've done it. I don't want to do it again. How come well, I represent let's way
*  Yeah, so you enjoy it more. Yes, it's freeing, you know, like you can do headbutts. There's no glove
*  I don't want to I don't want to put on like love. Yeah, I would consider maybe I mean I have offers
*  But one championship and Bellator. I was actually with Kong the other day in San Jose
*  Conley for those who don't know is a legend of
*  martial arts and a specialist and he actually calls Scott Corker in front of me is like
*  Get him a fight like I said, well, give me a couple years
*  I have a lot of things to do that out to be happy with my little career
*  You know more things to do but it's a possibility. How old you now?
*  27 27 so you you're still young. I mean you could make that transition
*  Yeah into MMA then wanted to we can go that we can go to this actually actually fight MMA
*  two times yeah, I was I was
*  So I'm a stupid one is younger so in that transition before going to prison fight
*  It's a after prison fight
*  but like in that transition like I had a year or two before raising enough money to go back and
*  Like I said, my first love was grappling right?
*  So I was doing I did some fight nights amateur MMA and I was I was I won my first MMA fight by guillotine
*  And then I went to here again another guillotine. So they gave me like the octopus again. I am choking
*  and then third fight was against
*  GSP's prodigy like a Japanese guy
*  So I went by decision. So I was undefeated in MMA an amateur, but then I go I go back from Thailand
*  I'm super excited. I'm doing my striking and I did some stupid decision like nobody wanted to fight
*  Murni is a good fighter. He's a good fighter and he was in he's in UFC now. What's his name Jonathan?
*  I mean he fought Colby Colbert in there not long ago and
*  So nobody wanted to fight him and you know, he was like, I know it's gonna be a striking fight
*  People saying he was a great striker. So I said let's go. I'm the best striker. So let's do something
*  So nobody was accepting the fight so I accept the fight, but I think it was a bit early for my pretty view
*  He was already on the radar for UFC, right? So I took the fight at 170, but I was
*  170 so he was a he was a big boy. He was I think he dropped down to like from 190 and but then on the feet
*  I'm like I'm winning. I'm doing some good spinning spinning punches and everything
*  But then Firas is in his corner and he's like down bring him down
*  So I just stupid I went on the I went on the floor and for me I treated it as a more as a BJJ
*  Competition, so when I'm on the floor, I'm on the floor, you know, I was in I wasn't very developed yet
*  I didn't have the ring experience yet. And again, he was the better fighter that night for sure
*  I almost had the armbar actually and I let it go the referee
*  I've actually stopped the fight because of elbows and the clinch and in the in the guard
*  but I yeah, I was a bit disappointed for this and
*  So it was just a bad, you know initial and early in my career now. I'm a complete different fighter
*  I fought, you know in front of thousands of people I have
*  So again, he's a great fighter, but I know that it would be a different thing nowadays crazy that you
*  You became this let the way champion without really training let way like you didn't really go to a traditional let way gym
*  Or learn it from them. You basically had your own approach thing together. Yeah. Yeah, I think so
*  I think it's like I said the Patron martial art in my in my in Canada
*  We we do a lot of like, you know Santa and a lot of central and my coach if you bet is
*  He did like two two pro fights, but he's a great coach
*  He's a very great coach and he just build me up for it because in G Cundo is a Sifu, right?
*  so you can do there's a lot of of
*  In the in the pocket is a lot of headbutts actually stuff every
*  Goes yeah. So yeah, I guess
*  That's why I
*  Kind of did everything
*  What do you want to do as far as your career?
*  Do you want to establish some sort of dominance and let way before you leave and go do something else?
*  Well to be honest, the only reason why I would consider go back to MMA would be because I have ego
*  I think all fighters have ego and I want to fucking out avenge my loss and
*  stuff like that, so
*  But honestly, I'm super happy with doing this as my goal was to be champion now
*  I've done it so I don't need 25 bells to be happy, you know, right? So but now you do how long?
*  Yeah, I'm doing this. Yeah, like you just mean basically you're the beacon right now
*  and a lot of people are going drawn to you because you become the most really the most worldwide famous left-wing fighter ever and
*  Because of that you're gonna get these guys that come like the Seth Bozinski's and guys who fought
*  Organizations and come to you. Is that what you would like to do?
*  I love that just be that guy and have everybody come to you and challenge you
*  Until like I'm I don't have that that hungriness anymore. It would be nice if there was
*  Broadcast of this
*  No, is it really was said was on you?
*  Sir, yes, you probably passes everything. No, it was a from Burma the trend they transmitted from Wow, that's incredible
*  Who's doing the commentary? Is that what Rob?
*  My man Robin. He was good. That was it was epic with this one. He's excellent. He's excellent. So actually next one
*  Hopefully can make it it would be in in what you do Wyoming or Florida. When is it gonna be June 100% in June?
*  100% we don't know which state though. Okay, so there's plenty of time between now and then do you know who you'd be fighting?
*  No, no idea. So yeah, that's the so if it's gonna be they're probably gonna try to do it on pay-per-view or something
*  Right is it does everything to do with the bare-knuckle fighting guys?
*  No, they're gonna do it different. It was it's gonna be a UFC fight pass. I believe and then people can watch it live there
*  It's gonna be a pretty exciting to like it's the first historic debut of the tweet
*  Yeah, 2000 years old of you know sport in yeah us. I'm so excited. That is very exciting. Yeah, it's it's very you know
*  It's like there's different styles of MMA or rather of martial arts that enter into MMA and become effective left way
*  The only thing that's missing is the headbutts from MMA, you know
*  You have this one element of your game that you wouldn't really be able to that's the thing
*  You know what? I was joking the other day long time before I received these these serious offers from mother and memory promotion
*  I was like if I go one day, I'm just gonna headbutt the guy and get disqualified and then it's gonna go viral
*  It's gonna help that's before I well
*  I think one FC would probably allow headbutts from all the way one FC is actually
*  Partnering up with WLC. So they're they're they're very friend with the CEO
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, and what makes sense is they allow soccer kicks on the ground even inside a cave
*  Had a little way
*  Exhibit not exhibition fight but let's we super fight one inside of one of their shows in one championship. Oh really?
*  Oh, that makes sense. So just to showcase the culture. Sure. Yeah, sure
*  I just see if I feel like if someone like you fought over there, I mean they have such open rules
*  I mean they have Muay Thai fights with MMA gloves. They have regular kickboxing. They have regular
*  Well, they message me for that. They want to meet the fight Muay Thai. I don't want to fight Muay Thai
*  I want to I said I want to fight let's ways that well if you want to fight the twig go to WLC
*  And that's when we started getting along man. Well, they're doing grappling competitions in one FC as well
*  They seem to be open to almost any martial. Yeah. Yeah for sure and also eSports now like that's the future
*  Why is a good shot trees a good fight is a good doing eSports. Yeah, I saw that one eSports
*  No, he's ahead of the wave. Yeah, because it's gonna be the future Wow what games I don't know
*  Fightings games like street fighting games. Oh my god
*  If it became huge would they have UFC and 1fc fighting the UFC
*  No, but I mean if they had the UFC video game
*  Okay, we're playing the UFC video game on this board in in 1fc that would be hilarious. It really would yeah
*  Oh my god. Look at that. That's eSport. Yes. Oh shit. Okay one championship launches Asia's biggest eSport world championship
*  Shatris is just a smart visionary for this like yeah
*  We have a size that fucking arena that does nothing shocks me more than the massive
*  Popularity of eSports in terms of as a spectator sport not in terms of people playing it
*  I get a total price like five hundred thousand dollars and like wow for eSports
*  So they're gonna go to the other side go the other side Jamie. Let me see that picture. Look at that
*  Oh my look at that. That's a game fucking crazy World of Warcraft. I don't know. Is that what it is? Yeah
*  Yeah, I'm Dota 2 is what it's called
*  Where this game I don't play it
*  We don't even know the game and they win half a million dollars for this like there's like 14 years old 15 years old these
*  Guys, yeah, I mean there's real money in video games now or before where parents would say you're wasting your time
*  Go play golf. You can make money. You can make money playing video games. You play games
*  I do but I get addicted to yeah, I have real like like like a day non-stop. I have fucking giant problems
*  We set up a land where you're laughing. It's true. He knows
*  See how much he gets in to tell you but yeah
*  Real problem are you an extremist like if you do something you do it like yeah, I got real problems man
*  Effective like look if I want to get good at something my brain
*  It's good because my obsessiveness allows me to really concentrate on excellence
*  Okay, but the problem is like there's no benefit for me getting really good at Quake Championship, you know, that's the game
*  We're playing right was it quake?
*  Champions your quake champions. Yeah, that's what we're playing. We got a land room set up back there and we play it
*  Yeah, so dude
*  Sweaty hand. Yeah, fuck twitch. Okay, we're out there playing but I'm just we're just playing against each other. Okay for fun
*  Yeah, man, but it's not fun. Okay. The problem is I mean it is the game. What is very fun was the game?
*  It's a first-person shooter. No, you've rocket launchers and rail guns. Yeah, it's definitely fun
*  Don't get me wrong
*  Yeah, but what's not fun is the amount of time that it takes and how I crazy I get
*  Where I'm like in the middle of the night I'm thinking about playing it like it'll be three o'clock in the morning
*  I've come down here like I had to do something. I worked out. I can't like I'll leave my house
*  I'll come down here to work out a workout the gym and say fuck it. Let me jump online
*  Get out next. You know, I'm here for four hours just playing quake. Yeah, I understand Jamie knows he's seen it
*  He's laughing is it like a real person monsters or real people?
*  It's you know robots and people with like, you know, like cyborgs and shit with crazy outfits on but that's the point is
*  It's a first-person shooter. So you're in this 3d environment
*  It's a mouse and a keyboard and you're running down these hallways and it's a lot of strategy involved a lot of fast twitch movements
*  And aim but it's very very addictive and it's graphically very intense
*  It's crazy how little boys we are depending. Yes. Yes. What's up?
*  Yeah
*  one of the companies that makes one of the really big eSports games just announced that they're working on if their first first-person shoot I
*  Think it's their first first-person shooter
*  They did announce the title that just sort of showed a couple of things they're working on
*  It's gonna not that you're gonna get back into it, but it could get you back into it
*  We have it right there man. I can't do it. I had a quick cold turkey
*  We were doing how many months were we going at it every day?
*  Solid three or every day man hours and hours every day. Jamie like laughed
*  He's like you guys put in more time me and Jeff who works here. We're playing so much
*  We put in more time and like how was yeah
*  Like in like three or four I had the game on my computer at home for about a year
*  Playing it just off and on here and there
*  Probably put in like 30 or 40 hours over time playing they passed me in like three weeks
*  But I had a problem like that with everything with jiu-jitsu with taekwondo with Muay Thai everything that I get into
*  I get into too much. It's a good trait, but as long as you can handle it
*  Yeah, you got to know how to handle it like for me
*  It's like I got to know when to cut things off like stop stop stop stop stop so for me with the video games
*  It's like no cut it out because it was just eating. I don't have any time man
*  And I have kids I have family and I have three jobs. I just don't I don't have the time for these fucking video games
*  But I like them too much. No, I feel like I'm now I got that my phone on the airplane
*  Could we do like literally like 20 airplanes is like this last couple weeks. Oh you play games on your phone
*  Yeah, like a castle defense. I just like I don't have any games on my phone except my kids play games on my phone
*  Sometimes I don't have any fuck. What do you do on an airplane? You just sleep? I read okay
*  I read or I write I write you know comedy material and stuff
*  I write things about watch a movie maybe but I don't play any games. I just I don't I just don't trust myself, okay?
*  Okay, just get too addicted. Okay. Yeah, you should fucking play it with us. Sometimes. Oh my god. We had more time today
*  Yeah, man, I'm telling you. It's super dick. I think obsession is key for any success
*  Yeah, and I think every successful people is eccentric a little bit. Yes. I'm fucking weird
*  Yeah, we're both crazy. It's important. Yeah, I think you have to be crazy to dedicate massive amounts of time to something and be obsessed
*  Yeah, it's a big to acquire excellence in anything. I believe it requires a real
*  Genuine obsession where that becomes a primary focus of your life
*  But when you have a finite amount of time like I do yeah, cuz I already have a career
*  I have things that I must do and I don't want to I don't want to slack off and become a bad
*  Podcaster and become a bad comedian and fall apart in the other things that I'm focusing on because I'm focusing on a game
*  That's true. Just can't imagine. Yeah, I know it doesn't help me see jujitsu helps me
*  Yeah, like when I train I feel more calm
*  I get better perspective. I feel like there's something that I am get I gain and also you can only do it a certain amount
*  Of hours a day. You can't do jujitsu six hours in a row
*  You can't but you can play video games ten hours in a row twelve hours in a row
*  You just keep going you know, I was like playing video games and they die people die. They die
*  They have fucking heart attacks and die. It's very very intense
*  like sometimes we leave and I don't even feel good like we leave and I feel all fucked up and
*  You're sad you're you're you're unhappy about yourself
*  You're like, why did I do this you wasted a lot of time and also like your system is so taxed because it's so intense
*  You know and we're talking mad shit to each other
*  What's up? Did you see that? Just made me think of this there an article about the amount of calories that chess masters burn
*  Yes, I saw that I was just thinking
*  In a tournament say like that they lose incredible amounts of weight during these tournaments in there
*  Well, they're just realizing now that this is a calorie thing that your brain when you're under intense focus
*  Your brain burns off a shitload of calories. So that's why I lose a lot of calories. I think yes mark
*  Yeah, I really think that that's the same thing with video games as well
*  I mean I get out of here man. I'm fucking exhausted sometimes when we were in those rambling places
*  You should go into that eSport thing. Fuck that
*  There's not enough lives to live, you know, that's why I understand when people say they're bored
*  I'm like, how can you be bored? There's so many things to do
*  You know, there's so many things you can get obsessed with. Yeah, you know, what's your opinion?
*  I wanted to pick your brain on that because I mean my wife we have a pact
*  Okay, and people are gonna think we're crazy, but I don't give a shit
*  We have since we met in 2016 and in Thailand. We never had a night apart
*  We know no nights apart and I loved it because I said I don't know we have only one life and I love her to that
*  She's my life partner. She's my you know, she always believed in me
*  I think she's the reason why I became champion because prior to meeting her I was just no no ambition
*  No, nothing, you know, I mean and then my point is is that the reason behind that is that I want to
*  You need more coffee. Yeah. Yeah, I need to I want to spend as much as I can because you don't know if there's something after
*  so
*  What do you think I
*  Think you should be happy and if you're happy doing that that's not nothing about that. I'm super happy with that
*  That's my goal in life is to like to have as much as much time as I can and it would hurt but I mean
*  Do you think because it's so it's helping no, no not this about the afterlife
*  I've I'm like
*  For first like science, I think
*  It leads to that we're gonna just
*  Cease existing. Yeah, but that's not science. Honestly, okay
*  well science is the study of how the brain works and the study of where you know where the memory is located and what parts of
*  the brain are affected by injury and studies on
*  FMRI where they're measuring areas of the brain that are active during specific activities. That's real science
*  There's no real science about what happens when I die meaning your speculation. I mean like body or physical body
*  I'm saying we're gonna just like it's gonna die, right?
*  And then then my point is I know there's absolutely no science about that
*  But my point is I'm doing speculations that if we do stop existing we do stop living and breathing
*  What's our essence where is it going right was if is there an energy there's a spirit what they
*  So hard to it's so hard to say well
*  No one can really say it's pure speculation and I'm always skeptical of people that think they know for sure
*  Nothing happens as much as I'm skeptical people that think for sure they know what happens
*  It's just comforting for some people to have an answer whether it's the lights go out and that's it
*  I mean, that's Richard Dawkins perspective. Oh, yeah, is it? Yeah, but other people's perspective
*  Never done psychedelics and it's like he's got this very reductionist perspective
*  Scientific based on what we know right now that if you when you die you die. Yeah, but that's nonsense. He doesn't know
*  I mean you don't know I mean
*  I understand that he's a man of science and logic and this is how he likes to frame the world
*  But the reality is no one has any idea and most people don't want to adhere to that train of thought because it's very scary
*  Well, it's also if you've done psychedelic drugs
*  You know that there's a very strange thing that can happen to your brain and to your consciousness when it interacts with certain molecules
*  What is that?
*  well
*  some people believe that that is a portal to the afterlife and that what happens when you die and
*  During periods of extreme stress your brain produces psychedelic chemicals. We don't know what the what the soul is
*  What is that a real thing? Is that a not is it nonsense? We don't know is your consciousness
*  Your consciousness is clearly affected by injury injury to the brain and it's clearly affected by age
*  It's clearly affected by deterioration. It's clearly affected by some
*  exogenous chemicals, but is
*  But is that you or is that something that your your brain is housing?
*  I mean what happens when you die does that does it?
*  Transfer to something else. Do you?
*  Does your brain, you know?
*  How's consciousness or does your body house consciousness or is consciousness a part of it?
*  And when your brain shuts off, there's no activity. This is a consciousness cease or you do you transcend? No one knows
*  Pen pen and teller. Yes. No, what's this? What's this? What's the big guy's name?
*  Pen yeah, I like it's what he said. He said we don't know that's the real answer the real answers. We don't know
*  Yeah, anybody saying other thing that that is I mean, I don't know. Maybe they know something we don't know but it's interesting
*  It's interesting to think of
*  You know and there's a lot of people that don't believe that you are the same person every day
*  There's a lot of people that believe that when you go to sleep
*  That you you wake up in the morning and you assume that all of your memories of your life
*  They're accurate and that you are absolutely the person that you were when you went to bed the day before
*  But you don't even know that Oh show that's a great
*  Oh, you don't know that you know that you have some memories that you you can call upon
*  Unless you record them like you do but even if you record them like who the fuck is recording it. Are you sure?
*  That's you. Okay. I mean, are you the same person? I mean this there's all these ideas of many worlds
*  Quantum physicists like to bring up that there's a bunch of different interactions that are happening
*  simultaneously and that
*  It's so hard to even it's so hard to even
*  to even conceive of the possibility of
*  multiple dimensions and then
*  the possibility of infinite universes that can't conceive that yeah that we travel back and forth through all these different things and
*  That based on the decisions that you make based on
*  Who the fuck knows although an infinite number of variables that your life?
*  Moves in a bunch of different directions
*  You know the idea of an infinite universe also means there's an infinite number of David Ladeau's out there
*  I know that's what's really crazy. There's an infinite number of young Jamie's
*  There's an infinite number of you know, fill in the blank Neil deGrasse Tyson's Mike Tyson
*  Vanderhoof is an infinite number of them and they're all doing different things is all slightly different lives
*  How was it when you did that when you did the DMT?
*  I've done a bunch of times. It's very strange. I'm scared of that. You should be scared. Okay, I'm scared
*  And what does it look like? What does it look like? What looks like? Well, it depends on the purity of it when you get it
*  Really pure. It's almost like a white looking crystal. Sometimes it's a little bit yellowish. It's more of a yellowish looking crystal
*  It's yeah, and you free base it
*  That's something that our brain creates. Yes your brain produces it
*  That's one of the reasons why your body can bring it back to baseline so quickly
*  Your body knows what to do with it. It has it. It's it's a part of your your whole you know
*  Chemical system. How do you come up? How do you read about this? How do you come up with this? I
*  Don't remember how I first heard of it. I think I heard of it listening to Terrence McKenna talk about it
*  I think that was the first thing I ever heard of it
*  when you know
*  When I first did it, I couldn't even believe I couldn't believe that this is a possibility
*  That this that this is something that exists on earth that so many people don't even know about
*  Did you like you need to lock the doors when you do it like you need I mean I did it in a you know
*  I did it in in my living room with some friends. Okay, how long does it last about 15?
*  Short it's like a three-day thing. I'm gonna no no
*  It feels like it's three days, okay, it feels like forever and then instant
*  It feels like it just happened and it also feels like forever, but it's it's very strange
*  It feels like you've been there before when you go there. That's one of the yeah
*  It's like you leave the world you leave this space and you go to some
*  Incredible dimension that seems more real than this. It's very very tense. You think it's like
*  Something that people should experience
*  I think that's up to people. Yeah, good point
*  I know we have to be careful what we say to people but I understand but yeah
*  I used to think people need to do it. I think people but I used to think people need to do everything
*  I think you do whatever you do and also having children. There's a lot of people that say you should have children
*  I don't know about that man. I think everybody has a different path. I think you can be a
*  Complete person without ever having children. I don't think that that's necessary for me. It was very educational
*  It helped me a lot. I love it. I'm very happy to be a father
*  I've learned a lot. Mm-hmm, but I don't think it's necessary. I think you can be a complete person without a lot of experiences
*  I think what's more important is like what kind of experiences are you having with the people that you're around with and are you being fulfilled?
*  like if you
*  Inherently like inside of you you always wanted to be a chess master, but you never pursued it
*  You're gonna have that regret and that longing for something for you
*  Let way if you didn't pursue that if you didn't go after that if you instead decide to get a job in accounting or something
*  Like that you would have this longing to do something and I think everyone has a different makeup a different
*  Psychological makeup different personnel and different interests and I think there's a lot of people that are interested in things that I have no
*  Desire to do and to them it's their whole life and I'm not interested in it at all, but I'm not them
*  It's like finding out what it is what it is for you
*  What what is it in your life that attracts you I've been very very very
*  fortunate and one of the things that I've been very fortunate is I
*  I'm I would say I'm a risk-taker
*  But it's more that I don't I don't have any interest in doing safe things
*  Okay in terms of like I don't have any interest in like taking an easy job a safe job
*  I know I'm gonna get a paycheck every week. That's never interest me. Okay, that's right. That seems like prison. Yeah
*  I really I've never been able to do it and I always thought that I was a loser because I couldn't do that because other
*  People could work hard and they can get a good job and they would get a pension security
*  I felt like when I was young there's something wrong with me that I couldn't do that because I grew up in New England
*  And in Boston everybody worked hard. There's like a hard blue collar sort of environment where everybody couldn't do it, man
*  I couldn't do it. These guys all showed up for work every day at 7 a.m. I wanted to kill myself
*  Did you do it a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tried
*  Did a lot of construction gifts and a lot of different small jobs
*  But it's the reason same reason why I left because I felt like it was missing something. I see the world
*  I wanted to leave. Yes, that's you though. But look now you're fulfilled. You're a fulfilled person
*  You're living your life, but that's you for other person
*  That would be torture if you had some guy that really just wants to be a mathematician and someone's like no no
*  You're gonna go to Myanmar. You're gonna be a fucking left-wing champion. You'd be like what I'm not a headbutton anybody the fuck
*  You're not man better. Is that gonna head but you know, you're gonna fight in prison. What what?
*  I'm not fighting in prison for the record. I wasn't incarcerated
*  Was in prison but that you know, everyone has their own path some people like do you know Alex Honnold is
*  He's the the guy who they made that movies free solo about he's the the guy who climbs all these mountains with no ropes
*  Oh my god, my dad is and he fell and he got this figured
*  But now it's healing up but he did it no rope how far he fall
*  Look, I have to show you the picture. It was a bad fall. It was a bad. It looked like he got bitten by a dog
*  It was like any yeah
*  That's I guess they look for a rush. That's an amazing rush. They must get I think so
*  But Alex the way he described it he said it's not really a rush
*  He said it's pretty mellow. Okay, because if every if you get a rush like you're in trouble
*  You know, he's like the whole thing but it's obviously there's something about that intense challenge that's appealing to him
*  That doesn't attract me at all
*  Not even a little bit. I have no fucking desire. I don't want to even climb with ropes
*  But this guy loves it. Did you do bungee before you try bungee? No never done that either. No fuck
*  Some people love it man, I get it I get look my friend Andy he's a world champion
*  He's that he holds the world record in
*  Climbing one of those wingsuits my friend Andy stump. That was a gold. I meant for a while
*  Oh, but he's had a bunch of friends have died man
*  They've had to carry them off the mountain because they fucking hit the ground
*  You know guys who have jumped and then they hear a crash and then they realize that guy just slammed into a fucking tree
*  Oh, there's a really horrible video. They go slamming into a bridge
*  Oh, he's trying to go through a bridge
*  He was trying to make it through the gap of a bridge you misjudged and he slammed right into the bridge while these people
*  Were on it filming it you see him come in and he just misjudges it and BAM
*  He hits the bridge. It's horrific man. If he has a strong neck, he's fine
*  See, I think
*  Everybody is different. Some people are put on this life to be a poet
*  Some people put on this right to be an author describe put on this life. No, I mean whoever you are
*  Okay, how you feel what is what is the thing that you're drawn to for some people? It's architecture
*  They want to build houses. They're fascinated by the construction methods
*  They're fascinated by design and they're just really drawn to want to build houses
*  Yeah, some people want to make music
*  Some people are drawn to lyrics and they're drawn to musical notes and bars and changes and that's their thing
*  Everybody has a I mean some people have many things, you know, and then something for some people
*  That's their problem is they have so many things. It's hard to focus on one, but it really the key
*  I think the happiness of life is
*  Fight being honest with yourself and finding whatever it is that's attractive to you
*  Yeah, whatever it is that draws you whether it's animation or sculpture or making clothes
*  What it's everyone has a thing while you were talking there. I felt like I was in another dimension
*  It felt like I was like I lost myself. Really? Yeah, that's the effect. I was like, I don't know
*  I'm thinking I think I'm I think I'm crazy. Yeah, you're definitely crazy
*  Yeah
*  To be really great
*  Crazy you're like you're doing something and then you have the feeling like you don't know. I don't know you're carried away
*  Yeah, you're getting carried away and the thoughts. Yeah, I have that all the time and it's a crazy life
*  Yeah, it is a crazy life, but it's a really crazy life if you follow your passions
*  Yeah, and it's a fucking crazy boring life if you don't well said and there's a lot of people out there that unfortunately
*  Whether it's their family
*  Sometimes your family they they'll try to influence you in a way to get you to do something that's safer
*  I mean my own family did that they were always trying to get me to the big one was graduate from college
*  graduate from University get a degree
*  You know have a safe, you know, don't just try to how'd you do it comedy?
*  Because I know Gary Vee is a big proponent of that like, you know quit school and
*  And how do you do like because a lot of people are are stuck with the parents think so you just said fuck it
*  I'm gonna do it regardless. Yeah, I think my parents gave up on trying to control me very young
*  I was you know, like they didn't even want me to do martial arts when I started doing martial arts
*  What did you start?
*  Really heavily when I was 15. I started when I was 14, but really heavily when I was 15
*  that's when I just became obsessed with type 1 doh and competing and and you know at first they didn't want me to do it but
*  Then that was like the first thing that I ever did that made me feel like I wasn't a loser
*  Yeah
*  It's like the first thing that ever did that I got really good at like good at and like started getting recognition from it and
*  started winning tournaments and then I realized like wow if I
*  Focus on something and become obsessed with something I can get really good at it. So that led to
*  Learning how to do that in applying that sort of same energy to other things in life
*  You know, I think sometimes people just have to find a thing
*  Whatever that thing is that really floats your boat and then find the time
*  Find the time to pursue it and set up your life so that you have the time to pursue it and now they're scared
*  So that all but if I do this isn't it? There's not gonna be income around
*  Just have persevere and money will come and yes. Yeah, everything is possible
*  I think and it's crazy that but I know that I kind of lived it
*  It's true. You can do it. You can do whatever you want. Well now you do live in Myanmar
*  No, no, we actually we lived in Dubai for a year
*  So we lived in Thailand for three years then we kind of kind of left for Myanmar for a few a few months
*  What brought you to Dubai? Yeah, we tried we went to Myanmar for a few months trying to open a gym
*  So I want to open the first let's with gym. It's on the ice for now. It will happen when they let's look little with gym
*  But for now this and then like it's very poor rights. It's like 50 years behind Thailand
*  It's it's it's a beautiful very raw very rich country and I rich like meaning the culture is rich
*  And then we kind of got there there's a real estate bubble there
*  So the place we had was a two-bedroom apartment two thousand dollars a month in Myanmar and it was not even downtown
*  It was like outside a bit and so I was like, okay and then electricity cuts happens all the time
*  You need a big-ass generator and and then when it cuts you don't have Wi-Fi. I was like my wife. She's Russian. She
*  She really raised her standards of living of living so I had to I have to I want to give her the best life possible
*  right, so then we get a call to do a seminar in Dubai we go there and
*  She's like I raining season is approaching Dave and when it rains
*  I don't want to I don't want to be in Myanmar cuz then everything stops, right?
*  So like okay, so imagine like and then I paid a deposit on another apartment before leaving the seminar
*  So it's like you're in Cleveland and you just you pay for a place because you're there
*  So you wanted to buy a new seminar. He said alright, we'll stay here for a little bit. Yeah, it was the end device very nice
*  Right. Yeah, but it's a bit like for me. It's a bit like fake like it's everything
*  It's a concrete jungle the best way to put it nothing grows there nothing nothing organic there
*  You get the raspberries and they they they perish in a few days like it's so it's the the desert really? Yeah, nothing grows
*  Yeah, but it's cool. If you want to party like me waiter
*  You just go there and you party and why does Mayweather party in Dubai? Everybody does
*  Rappers, I've only been there once you've been way ins. Yeah, there was a fight
*  There's a fight in Abu Dhabi and we had the Wayans in Dubai and we went there for a day
*  But I remember last year. No, I didn't go to that one
*  This was several years ago when Anderson Silva fought Damien Maya
*  Okay, and I remember thinking man is fucking Ferraris everywhere and Lamborghini's and Rolls Royce is a lot of money
*  Yeah, Dubai has a lot of money
*  You know that this the this crazy thing is that you get a nice car like I get us
*  I have a sponsor there. I drove cool cars. I'm not a big job McLaren. You got a McLaren not me is the
*  Yeah sponsor one at the 320 something s
*  I don't care. I'm not a materialist guy like what I found my sandals on the floor like I still around them
*  I don't I don't like I give my money else's
*  It was it was they had holes in it. So I don't I think he actually I really don't care about
*  Clothing like this is a t-shirt from a fan and I
*  Yeah, anyway, I'm not a very big material. So you have a sponsor that gave you a McLaren a drive
*  Yeah when I'm there, yeah, so now we actually left there and now we buy
*  Yeah, and now we bought a place in we have a house that we want to grow there in Cyprus
*  So now we live in Cyprus where site is that's outside of France. It's
*  Mediterranean so next to Jordan Egypt Turkey. It's like the most eastern country in Europe in you you what brought you there
*  You know what and it was I wasn't Dubai with my wife like I don't see we can have a kiss here
*  It's a bit like, you know, everybody they're gonna grow with bad values
*  I believe it's all about materialistic about like, you know, everything is about the money you want to want a car
*  You need to pay like to have the one one one. It's a million dollars for that. Like it's all just bad values
*  I believe for me. Oh, you mean the license plates? Yes
*  Oh one one one license plate so it's not enough to have a nice rule source
*  You need to have the one for the road. So that's an extra million. That's hilarious
*  They pay a million bucks for the license plate. What a bunch of dipshits
*  Thank you. That is the dumbest fucking thing who gives a fuck what your license plate said a million dollars
*  That's when you just running out of shit to buy and you start, you know, like people buy exclusive things
*  There's only three of these purses like well, they should make more
*  It's so not important in our human life like it's so not important this license plate thing is so weird
*  You know, they have an issue with that in the United States
*  They have an issue with people from other countries that bring their cars over here
*  Okay, like really rich people from Saudi Arabia. Oh, yeah
*  They call it Saudi Arabia in summer because in summer in Saudi Arabia is so fucking hot that summer bro in America
*  Seems like nothing so summer in LA which gets to be 105 degrees they fucking spit on that they laugh at that like that ain't shit
*  Yeah, so they bring these expensive cars like Lamborghini's and Ferrari's to shave them from the summer
*  And they when they bring them over here and they bring them over here with Saudi Arabian plates
*  so they have like embassy plates and they have like consulate plates and
*  You know
*  It became an issue in parts of Beverly Hills because like they're not even registered and they're they're not even registered
*  I don't know what the fuck they do. Okay, but they're driving these things around like I was at a hotel in Beverly Hills
*  I went to a restaurant there and there was a car that was parked there like a Lamborghini that had a
*  Like Saudi Arabian license plate. I mean this is crazy. Mm-hmm
*  Like how do you have a Saudi Arabia plate in America? Like how the fuck does it even get over here?
*  The guy was saying no, it's like that the whole thing about license plates
*  It's like it's like a sign of opulence that they're able to ship their vehicle from there
*  Not buy a car here and register it here, but ship from you drive their own car here
*  That's what they bring it over here on a boat. Oh my god
*  Yeah
*  So they they put they load their shit up on boats have it brought up here
*  They pick it up at the dock and then drive it around with Saudi Arabian plates like status
*  I guess there's when you deal with things like oil money
*  I think it gets to this level that you and I will never understand
*  A level of money that just is born into it too
*  Yeah
*  but like again
*  I'm also a bit grateful because
*  No, the highest suicide rate is in trust fund babies people are born with too much and they never worked for it
*  So then they're unhappy so I think hard. It's okay to work for your goals
*  You know you feel more happy with it
*  To go back to what we said like we just Google with my wife. We were in Dubai
*  We just go so where we want to live. So I said what's important for us? No snow
*  Yeah, so we just Google what's the best weather in the world?
*  We had the luxury to say that so I said cool we googled it
*  It gave us Spain Cyprus and Costa Rica Costa Rica was a bit too like
*  Bugs. Yeah monkeys crocodiles
*  Cyprus so what's it like in Cyprus? It's like amazing. What language do they speak Greek and English?
*  It's used to be Greek. It's a Greek and actually Turkish invaded four years ago. So half the island is Turkish
*  They took it back from like years ago. They said it's our part of the island
*  They took half of the island and the other half the the north is all Greek beautiful. So did you learn Turkish?
*  Did you learn Greek? No, it's English English
*  Yeah, and actually half the people there is a million people in the island
*  That's the country a million people in the country and most of it are Russians. So my Russians are good
*  Oh, and your wife speak Russian as well. She's born there. Oh that helps but I she taught me so
*  Wow, that's you you lived an international life my man the Nomad. Yeah
*  You too. Yeah, but so now when you're training, are you training you're training in Cyprus? Do you have your part?
*  That's the hard part. So right now I would like my last training camp
*  I came back to Canada in Montreal coach with Sifu Patrick we train hard and then
*  Now I'm like where I'm gonna do my next training camp, you know, I have to fly maybe it cuz this high level of striking in
*  Turkey, you know glory I have a friend that fought and yeah
*  So I'm like, maybe I'm just gonna fly the guy for a month train with me in Cyprus and then fight, you know
*  Oh, but if the fight is in June in the States, I will actually probably do my training camp again with my bad-node guys
*  Yes, I think I will do my training camp in Montreal again. That's good too because it'll be the spring. It'd be fairly
*  Well, yeah true. I don't want snowman
*  I grew up in Boston. I get it. Yeah, not as cold as Montreal though
*  Okay, your your area is Quebec is quite a bit colder
*  Yeah, I remember thinking that Boston was cold and then I went up to Montreal in December December
*  I was like what the fuck man. This is real cold. That's next level cold. Yeah, you know, I don't have a Boston accent
*  No, I got rid of it. Okay. I heard myself on TV
*  I won the Bay State games when I was 19 and I heard myself on TV and I was like, oh my god that fucking
*  Boston pack your car. Okay, where can really had there's like a it's like it's a weird accent
*  It's a strain. Every accent is weird. Sure. That is weird, too
*  Yeah
*  Everything I think everything foreign to us is weird, but Boston is particularly gross when women have that accent. Okay
*  It's just like you know some actions are hot with women like English is hot, you know, George, Georgia, Texas
*  That's hot Russians hot
*  Boston's gross. Yeah, it's gross
*  You in New York is better than Bob something about Boston. It's just like when women have it men can have it
*  It's cool. It reminds me of my friends. I like it
*  I like when I hear it on men, but I hear on women
*  Maybe that's what the problem is reminds me of girls that I dated when I was young
*  That's why oh, let me get the fuck away from you touched it right there. That's what
*  Where you going? Hey
*  Yeah, so this is crazy so when you're that will be definitely your next fight will be in June June in the States
*  I'm so excited for this. You have a lot of time to think about that man. We're only here. It's not even November yet
*  November. Yeah, so then actually now I'm in the middle of the look at my
*  You stole my name Joe. I called it the day of the Zook experience
*  Well, I stole it from Jimi Hendrix. I sold it from Gary
*  He had it before I was born, you know, I mean Hendrix had the Jimi Hendrix experience. Okay in the late 60s
*  It's good. Yeah good. Yeah, but you're you're you're it's a worldwide
*  Brand now. It's amazing what you've built. It's crazy. Congratulations. Thank you. I don't know how it happened just happened
*  Well, you're a personal, you know personal guy everybody loves you. It's you deserve it
*  But I think it's just it's one of those things you just keep doing it
*  If you just keep doing things you just get better at doing it
*  Consistency and as I know your advice on that because I started to think all that with Tuesday
*  I did 35 episodes and while I was in Asia and I was killing it and it was pretty cool
*  But then I what is it? Is it on YouTube? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got a decent amount of views
*  Not your views, but like but is it um instructional?
*  Yeah, so I was it was when I was doing my my first fights
*  I was teaching, you know the headbutts and the culture and I'm gonna start it again
*  But is it on YouTube right now? Yeah
*  It's go on the how to build your hands. They might like this one build your hands like a two minute video
*  What do you do?
*  So if my push-ups I it's basically you can do some push-ups on your knuckles with some likes micro jumps to create some like
*  Get used to that fractions. Yeah, and then finger finger push-up for all the tendons the ligaments
*  Well, you're doing that you're doing it with these knuckles. You're not even doing it with the front two
*  Yeah, I guess it depends. I'm doing if I don't my tricep it would be those two
*  Yeah, I would just sit on the table. It's hard to say that's the thing about that
*  We always they would always tell you in karate or anything else when you're punching that if you're gonna punch with their knuckle
*  Yeah
*  They get hard as shit are using anything to you like a macawara or something pounding on something
*  I just do I actually want to save my hand as much as possible
*  Right. I either getting so fucked up for the fights. I put my hands in the ice bucket and after every fight
*  So I just like save them but I do my eyes information, but then these and then on the wrist. Yeah, you try these ones
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's hard. Yeah
*  fingertip push-ups knuckle push-ups and then wrist push-ups
*  So this is that's a little high how to build your beginning you can show the beginning of it
*  That's a cool video to though. That's the that's to to that's me
*  I just let this roll Jamie so we can see some of this
*  So headbutt right there boom boom
*  This damn
*  Oh, that's nice
*  Did Cyrus try to head but you did he couldn't I was it was a one-sided fight completely
*  So he didn't did he prepare for yeah, he was a veteran
*  You went to Myanmar before me so that you know, you spoke about it last time
*  I think so that would mean to do that's my fake roundhouse the psyche. Oh nice super annoying
*  That's a good move man fake roundhouse. You have a psychic for especially for a long tall guy like that
*  But anyway, so that's what else that's the push-ups
*  So do you punch the bag bear knuckle a lot with no wrist wraps or anything? Yeah, exactly
*  Actually the one you see the good quality of you. That's
*  Jeff is that Jeff's and like he was he was here with Israel is Israel's personal guy. Oh, it's a with Israel Adesanya
*  Yeah, man, we met to me and Jeff and in tiger at the time. So I was I missed those high quality videos
*  Now I would do it on my phone. I think what's interesting because you're one of the only guys that speaks English
*  That's talking about this that's talking about this sport and that competes in this sport
*  Yes a champion of the sport mean as far as like the history of the sport
*  You're probably one of the real really the only guys who's an English speaker that's been a champion
*  Yeah, so the ligament that the push-ups on the hands
*  I think it's a very hard way I do it in my seminars people have a hard time doing it and I think it's key
*  Because if you do like you fight with no gloves with only head wrap gauze
*  You really can feel you can feel it fucking training
*  Basically, you know if you hit the teeth or something
*  You need to have you know
*  you don't want to get this because the why starting doing these is because I fight in Japan and
*  My second fight in Japan and I was always like a dream of mine because a Street Fighter right then in Super Nintendo
*  Street Fighter
*  Japan, you know
*  I was always thinking like either a guiled or American or Sagat and then that's the one that's on the knuckles
*  So you do some little jumps and the weight I'm gonna tell it right away. I think what is that surface is that concrete?
*  Yeah, that's concrete. Yeah, they're for the craziest of it. Like you do something. This is not very pleasant
*  This one but it's just and you're not using the front two knuckles. Well, I guess yeah
*  I mean the first a big one touches if you look at the big one in the middle
*  But not the not the far wave when I fight you're right
*  But when I fight it's only the big one that pops out anyway, but and have you broken your hands fighting that way?
*  No, no, I actually that was going there. So when I fight in Japan
*  I'd for second at the second round. I dislocated my finger. It was pretty bad like broken dislocated and
*  My corner man is a former Golden Belt guy
*  Doesn't speak a word of English again and I'm like pop it out so I can lease at least I can close my fist and finish
*  The fight right so he doesn't work doesn't understand nothing and you can see like it's pretty it's pretty bad
*  So I ended up fighting the whole fight like this
*  I'm like I couldn't close it. So I'm like, okay and then but I'm thankful it happened because that was the first fight
*  I landed like my elbows and my first headbutts first like solid because you had an injury had no choice
*  I couldn't write I couldn't do my cross anymore. Right? So elbows headbutts that you try to pull it out yourself
*  I didn't know at the time I did I tried it but it was the doctor required
*  Needed he used a lot of force to do it
*  Oh, I think it wasn't I wasn't so I didn't want to make a big scene out of it because all the Japanese people watching
*  It they knew about it because the commentator was talking about it. Yeah, it's like David son
*  fingers, but my Turkish opponent
*  He didn't know so I was like I don't want him, you know, so but yeah
*  It was we finished a fight and there was a now I'm like I never will happen again. I started training these
*  So what do you do in the offseason?
*  So if you're not if you don't have a training camp
*  So if you don't have someone coming to you to get you prepared for a fight, you know, I'm a fight until June
*  Yeah, you want to stay sharp. So what kind of work you doing? Well, it's funny after we done today. I'm gonna go with go core
*  I'm gonna do a private with him
*  I like I like to stay sharp with this
*  So you gonna learn leg locks and our school the Patent on martial art is actually affiliated with go core highest and Academy in
*  Montreal and get to know Quebec
*  Well go cars Academy is one of the very first around this area and even in the country that was
*  Concentrating on leg locks a lot of those guys were killer. They're not guys. Yeah, I think Manny Gaborian
*  And I think he trained Rhonda is Silva as well. Yeah, so I really like him and he's I think he's 56
*  Six a still arrest. It's like competing still competing go car still competes
*  Yeah, you did like the Masters not a long ago. Interesting. Anyway, so I'm gonna go there, but I I try to
*  Yeah right now like on the tour especially on the tour and I can't even I can't even I did some weights in the hotel
*  Room, but like we did there's you we do a state every day. Oh, wow. So you just worn out
*  So tonight we're leaving for Texas then New York then when you get back when you get back to Cyprus
*  What do you do to stay sharp because you don't have a gym there, right? Yeah, do you have a gym that you train?
*  We are in our place and in the basement
*  We have a full-on gym like private not as cool as you right there not as big
*  But we have I have everything I need and then you don't have sparring partners. You don't have someone to hold pads
*  Yeah, I would have I'm gonna I'm gonna cuz we just literally moved
*  Yeah, I bought the place a month ago a month ago. We dropped the luggage and we left for the tour
*  So crazy though for a guy who's a world champion and a professional fighter to not be in a place that has
*  professional trainers fighters because I want to I
*  Am a big proponent of like I want to really I want to have I want to relax
*  I want to I want to enjoy life grow old with my wife
*  Sure, so I feel like this is the best one of the best. I mean America is an amazing country
*  But I feel this is the best country like because it's very there's no traffic. LA. There's a lot of traffic, right? You think
*  Crazy so no traffic good for you walk in the streets in Cyprus and you can pick olives literally
*  We made a test olives and I give it to my wife then a date then a fig then a quanta
*  Everything we had about a million fruits in a ten minute walk. It's free on the street. Just growing off trees
*  Yeah, organic. So I'm like, this is cool
*  you know, it's it's fresh and it's and also I studied because I
*  Wanted to I want to live as long as I can because I get we don't know what's gonna happen after so I'm like in
*  Japan one of the islands has the one of the highest
*  Long-distance they died late. Yes, so
*  Because they're near a body of water and they have a lot of seafood, right?
*  So I want to be on a body of water and this is an island
*  So yes, what sounds like the quality of life is beautiful there
*  But I just the only thing that I'm going to be concerned with is that training I know and then and also sparring partners
*  I know and how someone to hold paths someone to coach you
*  I mean that's what right now so far. It's been amazing
*  Like I said, I've been in like in Dubai and all my training camps back in Canada. We're good
*  But now you're right after in January we go back. I'm gonna fill my Academy like my videos
*  Which is also gonna take a big part of it and then I have to stay sharp
*  So I'm gonna have to look around and see what the gyms are. I didn't even look it into it. Yeah
*  I know I know but I'm turkey has a lot of high-level fighters
*  30 minutes like yeah and even wrestlers and a lot of so it's a 30-minute flight to Turkey
*  Well, I do that. Yeah, and maybe you could fly people that come to you
*  But that's one thing it seems like you now that your profile is getting bigger
*  Yeah, people would probably be more willing to come to you to train to learn and then train with you
*  Just the thing is like I've I've I've realized all right. I put on a high high esteem
*  Quality of life. You know, I want to yes fighting is cool, but it's I'm 27
*  Maybe I'm gonna retire at 35
*  Let's say right like I'm gonna do as much as I can but like the rest the other 70 years after that if I live until
*  I know five right the other side. It's not gonna be it's gonna be I'm gonna be I'm not gonna be competing in the ring anymore
*  So I value that a lot. That's a biggest part of my life, right? Yeah, I've only been fighting professionally for it since 2013
*  so
*  But yeah, I I was gold 35. Is it the goal? I think it's perfect. Yeah, it's good more than that
*  I think you I don't know maybe because I'm actually excited to see when I'm gonna hit 30 my
*  Testosterone like, you know, I'm gonna be stronger at 30 31 32 because you definitely be smarter
*  You know, that's the thing smarter in terms of life experience, you know
*  You have enough
*  I mean they say the best fighters are really in their early 30s because their body is still strong
*  But their experience level is much higher. Okay, so like when you're 20 you probably you might be stronger or faster
*  But you don't know as much you don't have as much experience
*  You don't your technique is not as sharp and as you get older you just develop more experience as long as you're
*  Dedicated and focused. Yeah, but then again the thing that I'm saying is the one thing that I would be concerned with is the lack of time
*  Yeah training in a high-level environment, which I think is one of the most crucial things. Yeah, so so far
*  I've not had that problem, but when I'll be when I'll be like actually moving there
*  I need to I need to to fly some guys and yeah
*  We gotta let us know when you do fight and it's in the United States will promote it
*  We'll let everybody know and and hopefully you'll have an opponent that yeah people recognize. Yeah, absolutely
*  I want to I want to I would be good fight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it was so what's your
*  Okay, perfect. Yeah. Yeah, I actually have something, you know, Jamie you felt last time you did the
*  the chin long video the
*  You shared a video of two guys kicking the balls over their head member
*  Oh, yeah, yeah that crazy sport. It's like it's like volleyball with your feet. Yeah
*  Yeah, so this is like it's Saudi Stasia and they have that I have the ball with me for you. Oh
*  What's the ball they use? Oh, that's it. Wow, that's crazy. You see it. That's the ball of the kick
*  Yeah, and wow and you get it looks strong. It looks hard, but you can head butts with this
*  Oh, yeah, I'm sure because that's what he do you can use all your life
*  Yeah, yeah traditional
*  Saudi Stasia sports
*  Sipak trucker man it watching those guys is incredible the leg dexterity. No, no, what is the game called again?
*  It's in Myanmar. It's called chin loan when you go in circle. That's the back tuck bra. Wow
*  It's amazing watch those guys. Oh, they're so they're playing on a court. Yeah, I've only seen it played like on the video
*  And outside oh my god, look at these fucking guys
*  That's incredible. Look at the fucking flexibility. That's insane. Oh my god
*  That is incredible. Um
*  Wow, look at this dude. Oh shit. Look at that kick. That's Malaysia. Wow

*  Flex and you can use your head too
*  Wow, what a sport so they they me I'm are like it's part of the culture after every every training we go in a circle
*  And we do that. So it helps you can you know, like, oh, yeah and your flexibility

*  Dave it's in my video. It's like David me. I'm are and I've tried it and
*  I'll call me I can only do my like with my right leg like a hacky sack and my head but that's it
*  You can see maybe David me I'm are something there's in my and
*  Yeah, they they're they use their legs like crazy and I think it helps you I think become a better fighter
*  I believe oh I would imagine I mean, yeah, the leg just the dexterity and flexibility and range of motion
*  Yes guys have I mean they're almost like it's like watching a ballerina
*  Slash kickboxer play soccer with their feet, but they're playing volleyball. Yeah, and this this is plastic
*  Yeah, usually it's made of a ratan
*  Okay, you know like some kind of bamboo. Yeah, and yeah and but at first, you know
*  Yeah, it doesn't hurt right but I now I can enjoy it like I asked him
*  I did a seminar and I actually like I made them play a little bit
*  It's just part of the culture because it's cool. Yeah, it's it's
*  It's pretty wild game and that's a very popular game over there. Yeah, yeah everywhere in the street
*  I usually when I'm walking my wife and she's like, oh not again
*  I see a couple like, you know locals playing I just stop I drop everything
*  I put my laundry up because I always wear my laundry and I start playing with them and they're all excited
*  Oh shit, like they do some pictures. So you like a big celebrity over there like they walked on the street to people recognize you
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they love us there. It's pretty cool. But again, we I really I really like them
*  They're so kind like honestly, maybe I've traveled in Asia. Yeah Thailand and that's how it felt
*  Everyone was so nice there
*  But they imagine like 40 years before that when they were untouched by tourism, uh-huh, you know even like tell me yeah
*  Yeah, so they kind like they're they shake your hand like this
*  Look at this. Yeah, that's my video. I was I was in the forest
*  With them and they're guiding and read was he's sponsored by the country to play that Wow
*  And say we're gonna see that. Yeah, he's good. That's a wild fucking game. This
*  Is that's what they asked the laundry you see I tied it up but then you have to lift it up like this
*  That's so cool that you have that that video and you lift it up
*  And then if you have your leg tats, then you show your war war tats, right? Ah, I see so then
*  So this is before you had like tats too. Yeah before I look I look naked almost. Wow
*  Yes, that's the only strike I can do
*  They play that all the time it seems like there's a steep learning curve to this game
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah headbutt right there. Yeah, pretty crazy game, man
*  So that's the can you see the tanaka under skin?
*  Yes, this is a specific from EMR and it's like it's a route that they break up and the it's good for SPF
