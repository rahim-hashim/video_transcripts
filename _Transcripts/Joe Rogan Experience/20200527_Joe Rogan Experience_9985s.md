# JRE MMA Show #96 with Justin Gaethje & Trevor Wittman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICrqTmO3Eo4)
*  boom trainer of the year Trevor Whitman you might be you might get it we'll see
*  I got I got not that many athletes so that's where you know when I'd won it
*  two years ago that was unique to me because I went in there like man I don't
*  deserve this I remember having 40 athletes and the guys who have all these
*  athletes is put in so much time I had three athletes at the time so that was
*  cool but again I think performing and doing good as a coach is one thing but
*  also you know putting in that full-time when you run in a gym and having 40
*  athletes it's a non-stop 60 hours you're not doing anything with your children
*  yeah that's that's but then when I seen the athletes talking on the screen and
*  talking about you know Rose talking about changing the world and just being
*  good people then I was like oh yeah and I remember repeating to myself when I
*  went through a tough time and lost all my athletes we kind of had to split and
*  it all happened through when Nate Markhor had that issue with the TRT and
*  you know I had talked about the gray area you know if you're gonna allow
*  someone to do that you have that space like he instantly got shunned for it and
*  he's got children he had a new kid on the way and I was just like man he got
*  shunned we knew about it prior and I'm just like they said you could do it but
*  they don't know how to test the levels and that situation turned into a bigger
*  situation and then I ended up starting over with athletes I remember repeating
*  to myself you're the best coach in the world no one's better and I remember
*  just repeating I had a new gym that was big 13,000 square feet I was paid about
*  myself then I just kept saying it over and over and over and then we were no
*  sitting there that night I was looking at looking at him and we won like seven
*  awards that night which is the three of us and I was like man that's super cool
*  that's when it kind of hit and I was like oh man there's something to be said
*  for having a small stable of athletes versus like there's some of these super
*  gyms where a lot of guys wind up complaining a lot of guys wind up saying
*  they don't get the attention they deserve they feel like they're
*  staggering or they're stagnant there and it's just it's not it's I don't think
*  it's the right way it's so different I'll tell you it takes it back to my
*  boxing days I only had three or four athletes at the most and I was running
*  with them and and had him on my house and I was feeding them and they were at
*  my house for camp and it was one-on-one for everything for the psyche I mean
*  that's that's such an important part when it comes to fighting outside of
*  Justin Gaethje. Justin Gaethje I learned from this guy when it comes to mental
*  like he's just ingrained with like the strongest mental and I love that part
*  like that's why I love working with Rose because the mental part but one-on-one
*  is key that is key to be unable to be with your athletes and I'll tell you
*  it's like a hobby again it ain't like a job it's like passion you know and you
*  never really want to do it for the money you need to pay your bills but the key
*  is it's the athlete it's about them. Justin when you came to Trevor like how
*  much striking experience had you had? Zero. That's hilarious. No I was uh I had five
*  amateur fights I had never never been in a street fight a one-on-one street fight
*  couple big brawls I've never thrown a punch never been punched and I got hit
*  hard in my fifth fight almost got knocked out I was like man I need to find
*  if I'm gonna do this I need to find a coach. So you had five amateur MMA
*  fights with zero striking training? Zero I was just I would just take so right
*  after wrestling was over I would just be like I want to fight and then I was you
*  know I was in the best shape of my life after wrestling season right so I was a
*  machine still but I just had no no skills it was go out there and wrestle
*  take them down slams I was you know I got my nickname the highlight before I
*  ever knew how to strike and that was from throwing tossing people. I'm gonna tell you when he came into my gym so I met him at one of the fights and I thought he was a Japanese guy because I was traveling to Tokyo a lot with Dwayne
*  and his name Gachie for some reason just I pictured a Japanese guy. Yeah I seen him fight. And I was like oh my god it was spectacular the way he was throwing people and putting them on their head I was just like amazed and I talked to him in the locker room I was like dude I'm a huge fan like your fighting style is so unique and then he's like I'd love to come to your gym so he comes down he comes in he's like I'm here to fight and I was like cool you know like I what we're sparring today he's like cool yeah I want to fight I'm like alright cool let's go back there let's say well we're sparring today let's get back here
*  I was like you have any gear and he's like cool what gear I need and I'm just like oh my god like you're out here fighting I take him to the equipment and I was like I get some gloves get some shin guards. What year was this? This is 2009. Yeah. Imagine imagine that moment if someone told you 11 years from now you'd look at one of the baddest motherfuckers on earth. I'd say it took me a week or two to know like his mindset and the way he trained like this first session that he had was one of the most unique so I tell him about this equipment.
*  I'm like get your equipment on I was like get one of those headgears and he goes he jumps up at me he's like well I gotta wear a helmet like no one else is wearing helmets and I'm like no one's wearing a helmet why the fuck am I wearing a helmet?
*  So he's sparring with this guy named Vinny Lopez and he gets hit with an uppercut while he's hitting Vinny with the overhand and he turns around and goes ooh and I'm like oh shit he's hurt you know so I go over to him I'm like you good and he's like that felt so fucking good he's looking at his fist
*  They both cracked each other so hard like KO shots like it was it was nice and from that time I was like dude you are super unique. I've never punched somebody like them before. I was like I know that fucking hurt dude. He's like you know Vinny looks like a mean he's all tatted up neck down Mexican you know looks like he's straight out of prison. He's Puerto Rican I'm gonna say that for Vinny. He's Puerto Rican. He looks mean dude he's mean.
*  He looks mean and yeah I was like I gotta go with him they're like yep. I was like alright and then I hit him I was like oh shit.
*  Real quick before I forget the one on one thing I was saying you've heard like five six guys as we've been going through these fights say how they appreciate the one on one time and you know that's going back to what that was I don't want to miss that earlier when you were talking about that.
*  That's the biggest thing for me. He's at every single one of my training sessions talking to me like he was talking to me in my fight for sparring. When he needs to call throw the towel in or call the fight he knows he watches me every day and this one on one thing is what these guys are understanding is so important.
*  It's everything.
*  When it comes to fighting at the high level.
*  It's having that unique relationship with a trainer. Having a trainer where you and the trainer are tight like that. Like DJ had it with Matt Hume. You know there's a lot of guys who have that kind of one on GSP had it with Faraz Zahabi.
*  That relationship is so critical. It's so because you're going in there together. You're helping each other. You understand. You know his whole process from beginning literally with him you know his entire fighting process from the beginning the first time he was there.
*  That's invaluable Matt. These guys that are jumping into these super camps and the person is just sort of giving you random general motivation in between the corner telling you to keep your hands up work the jab.
*  You know that's not enough. It's not it's not optimal. I really feel like the optimal relationship is a trainer that really knows the athlete well and is with them in every in every training session.
*  100 percent. I think there's a huge issue. First off big training camps are key just because the partners. I mean you will get champion level fighters out of there because you're seeing all different styles you're seeing wrestlers grapplers southpaws all different sizes.
*  So it's great for that and you adapt to different athletes. The hard part with that is you most of the guys train Jiu Jitsu somewhere else that go somewhere else for the conditioning they go they go to all these different places and all the coaches are they mean well.
*  They're all like oh man you're six weeks out we got to train hard and you're going from one hard session to the next hard session to the next hard session. And when you're with them all the time I pull back a lot on him and that's the key to peaking like a lot of times people just push hard push hard push hard.
*  And that's another huge issue in the sport is over training. Yeah guys get it's it's again that injuries in the sport are are are common all the time and most injuries are happening in training.
*  When you pull back are you doing it based on just your general feeling of how he looks and how he's performing what he's saying or are you using heart rate variability using a like a whoop strap or a heart rate monitor or anything.
*  No a lot of those are tech when it comes to those types of things my intuition is always played best for me and knowing each athlete each athlete is different.
*  Some athletes need to to fight at a different heart rate than another. They perform better at a steady high heart rate some need to spike like in the beginning when he loved the fight he loved to see people drowned in their eyes open.
*  So we trained like that he wanted to be the most exciting fighter so I'm there to make sure I'm hitting his goals not my goals like I'm there for the athlete.
*  I train every athlete differently and it's all about purpose like what's your purpose for fighting what do you want to be and his has changed the last four fights four fights ago.
*  He actually said he wanted to be a world champion and before that I want to be the most exciting fighter in the world and it was about going out there causing those wars and and in the gym he was sharp and could box and could really do some athletic stuff but he loved to see people drowned.
*  It's just amazing how technical your striking is considering the fact that you've really been only doing it for 11 years.
*  I mean you're one of the best if not the best striker in a hundred fifty five pound division that's a fact and stick that clean sharpness of you like your fucking left hook man.
*  It's one of the best I've ever seen it's so fast and so there's no fat in there.
*  He's been telling me one day you know your left hook is going to be your best punch and I was like what are you talking about.
*  And yeah man it's I'm just I played all sports you know growing up I was a I was a pitcher was a quarterback punter kicker.
*  You think there's a benefit in that.
*  Yeah I mean throwing a right hand throwing a right hand is throwing a baseball.
*  You know my kick does not necessarily just kicking them as hard as I can.
*  Now it's a placement timing is the most important thing there but those mechanics that I developed through those playing other sports I think has helped me so much just my athletic ability.
*  And then once I found you know this man is a genius I can't tell you how the process that he started 10 years ago you know I I had no idea.
*  I still don't know what the heck we're doing.
*  I'm telling you it's just listen.
*  It's you know how how how you want me to jump that's all you know every day I step in there that's what I'm asking him.
*  And he is an artist you know his mind you know I can't see even when he's talking about you know our onyx equipment.
*  He's telling me these things and I'm like you know I can't put it into my head I can't see it.
*  But you know I know and then once it's a finished product it's like holy crap.
*  Same thing when I fight you know every time after I fight I'm like holy shit.
*  I can't believe you know we've been working on this for 10 years but more specifically that the specific details that I that I executed in that fight last fight.
*  You know we had a short time and there was really certain things that we he instilled that I had no idea he was instilling.
*  And you know just came came to fruition on that night and it was it was spectacular to watch this spectacular to go back and watch after fight every time every fight.
*  Trevor how important is it for a guy to be a coachable athlete too.
*  That's one of the things you and Luke Luke Cardio both said after the fight that he's the most coachable athlete.
*  That's key. That's the whole thing is I'm there to assist.
*  And you know I I put myself as the co-pilot like I'm there to draw the map and you've got to trust me around these corners like you're the driver you're the one that knows but you have to trust me.
*  And to be able to be coachable I mean if not I'm just a water boy.
*  That's why I'm only coaching a few now too is we got to we got to be in this together and you got to trust me and I get I got to be there for you and if you trust me then every decision that I make for you you've got to trust whether it's hey don't take this fight.
*  I mean with the fight the last fight I was like no you're not taking the fight and he's like come on coach what fight is that.
*  This is the Tony fight when he first got offered for the first time and I was like no we're at Sparta session and he's like why not.
*  And I'm like because you said you'd never take a short notice fight.
*  I'm like no.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like 11 days.
*  Yeah.
*  But we've been traded hard like all that he hit me with all these points and he's like dude with the coronavirus going on who cares.
*  He's like let me get in there.
*  I need to fight someone right now.
*  I need to release all this and his little basic points.
*  I looked at him I said all right is it good.
*  Are you going to do it again.
*  You can stick to your goal on the next one because I might let you off on this one.
*  And he said I will never take a short notice fight.
*  That's why the second time it was offered he was even more pissed about it.
*  And I was just like he's like the other one was seven days out like I got nothing to lose you know I'll go out of my shield.
*  So this is the let's let's be clear for everybody that the first time was the Lamar California on the Tai Chi Palace.
*  Yeah.
*  April 18th.
*  And that was how many days out.
*  So I got the call.
*  I think it was 10 or something.
*  No I think it was like 15 days before that fight I got the call one night.
*  The next day I went we know I called him.
*  He said no that night went to sparring the next day and then that's when I talked you know not talked him into it but I did like seven hard rounds.
*  I felt great.
*  You know I had been sparring so much.
*  And so he was like I was like let's do it.
*  You know I talked him into it.
*  And then so we go hard and then I think it was when did they cancel.
*  I think it was 10 days before the fight they canceled it.
*  And that's when you know it went out the window and then they called you.
*  So then I right out of camp or did you.
*  Yeah I tried.
*  I was down to 168.
*  They called me at like 3 p.m.
*  And that night I went to sleep at like 182.
*  I went hard.
*  I you know just terrible choices.
*  I was like what do you eat.
*  Would you eat.
*  I went straight to a call McGill's World of Ice Cream.
*  You know double scoop with the waffle cone and then we ate pizza hut for breakfast the next morning.
*  Pancakes.
*  I had my cousin Basquito there with me.
*  He was helping me with my cooking and helping me around the house during that those hard 20 days.
*  And yeah we went hard.
*  And then three days later they called me and they're like you know it's May 9th.
*  And I was like fuck that.
*  I was like I don't take short short notice fights.
*  It's like this last one was you know 10 days.
*  I get the benefit of the doubt of it being a late late notice fight.
*  And now they want me to do May 9th.
*  You know that that goes out the window that you know me.
*  That's not now it's not really a late replacement fight.
*  It is but it is for me it is in general.
*  But you know the the general public would think you know this is he got a full camp and this is a real fight.
*  Blah blah blah.
*  So I was like no like I'm not doing it.
*  So let me get this straight.
*  So you're not doing it because you fell out of camp and started eating again.
*  Because because so that the 20 day notice was like something very special.
*  Like that was something I definitely could have performed and I would have performed.
*  And I think this is the April 18th.
*  I think I would have performed and I think I would have won.
*  I wouldn't have been as confident as I was.
*  I was terrified when they called me that night.
*  I was terrified.
*  Couldn't sleep the next day I woke up terrified because I knew I knew that this is not what I do.
*  This is not how I do it.
*  This is what.
*  Because you weren't fully prepared.
*  Because there's no way to fully prepare in that amount of time.
*  Right.
*  My mind my mind when I go in there and do I have to get my mind in a very very special place.
*  How much of it is that and how much of his physical.
*  You know I don't know.
*  I don't ask.
*  I don't have that question.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't answer that question for you.
*  But here's the question.
*  I don't process that.
*  But it's not something I ever process.
*  This what I'm saying in this way though is what how physically prepared were you were you in training.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just I was my I was the main training partner for Neil Magni.
*  I was in shape.
*  I was in shape.
*  So the second fight let me jump in here.
*  The second fight I thought was a way better way better place to be from a conditioning standpoint because he was already in shape prior to the first one.
*  We just went two weeks so hard like we were trying to get his body in shape quick and that's all that's a hard thing to do.
*  Then he went and gained 12 pounds which we were four weeks out of that point which is perfect because the fourth week out I always pull back on and let the body recover because your third in your second week are peak weeks.
*  Those are the weeks that we need to really hit hit hit prime and really push hard.
*  And it was perfect fit.
*  I'm like dude we take this time off you going up and eat and now you're ready to go again.
*  You got that little that little fire back in your body because you're able to eat whatever you want.
*  And I thought it was perfect timing from how I train my athletes from a conditioning standpoint and I actually had to talk him into that one.
*  I was like this is even better.
*  Like this is perfect for you for a five round.
*  So for your perspective is like he had a chance to recover.
*  Eat all that food.
*  Take a little break.
*  And that's good because your body gets to charge back up again and then grind back to six and five on week six and week five are hard weeks.
*  They're like a start to those those last two weeks of peaking because our fight week we slow down a little bit and we just turn the engine on turn it off.
*  So we go six and five on the weeks are really hard.
*  Then we pull back on week four.
*  We'll take like three days that are really light and then push it a little bit.
*  And then week three and week two are the ones that I'm trying to get him to peak it hit five rounds.
*  We're not doing six rounds.
*  We're not doing seven.
*  We're making sure that we can go five minutes hard for every round.
*  Be sharp.
*  Not get lazy.
*  And I thought it fit perfect.
*  So when you're saying week two, you mean two weeks out two weeks out right before we leave for the fight.
*  What do you prefer?
*  Like if you had a blueprint like they came to you.
*  Trevor, how much time do you want before a fight like we'll schedule it around your time?
*  If you're in decent shape, eight weeks.
*  If you're out of shape, twelve weeks, twelve weeks because you take three or four.
*  If you don't lift weights for a little bit and then you come back and lift weights and you have lived for six months or three months, you're going to get real sore.
*  Yeah.
*  So you've got to have that break in process where your body because your body is going to be shutting down and you start to.
*  So you have to get through that process.
*  It's just the pre training and then you start to hit it hard because you can't just go in hitting it hard.
*  If you're twelve weeks out, you just can't break you down.
*  You're going to get hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  So why did you feel that that was not a good fight?
*  The May 9th.
*  So I had no idea I can.
*  My body would respond as well as it didn't.
*  I didn't think I could be ready to 100 percent without.
*  I've always done twelve weeks.
*  That's my that's all I've known.
*  That's all I've ever felt like the first decision was just like a split decision is the middle of covid-19 fucking.
*  I'm going to do it anyway.
*  And then when they came to the second time, you're like, no, no, no, no, no, I want a real.
*  Yeah. So why can't we just push it to May 26th?
*  Right.
*  You know, give me three extra weeks.
*  Then I get my whole then I get my whole ten weeks.
*  And that's all I asked for.
*  So that was my mindset when they call me because I knew they were going to call me the day before.
*  I was like, watch, they're going to fucking call me and they don't want me to fight May 9th or something like that.
*  And I knew it. And then my manager called me.
*  He's like, May 9th, let's go.
*  I was like, fuck that.
*  I was like, no, he was so bad.
*  No, I was like, fuck that.
*  I was like, I ain't no fucking puppet.
*  I'm not going to dance when they want me to dance.
*  I was like, I said, I don't take late replacement fights.
*  This is now late replacement.
*  You know, this is different circumstances.
*  These aren't the circumstances.
*  Everyone and even he was like flabbergasted.
*  He's like, what are you talking about?
*  It's the same thing.
*  I'm like, no, it's not the same thing.
*  Like, to me, it's not, you know, like, because I don't know.
*  It's confidence is everything.
*  I know I can perform, you know.
*  But you wanted everything to be done right.
*  It was the biggest fight of my life.
*  Right, of course.
*  And but ultimately, and then when I thought about it, I was like,
*  it's only if it's anybody's fault, it's my fault, you know,
*  because I knew this, you know, I knew I was going to fight again.
*  And if I'm not, I wasn't, I was training hard, but I wasn't training
*  with the mindset, you know, that I need to have old school wrestling mentality.
*  You know, you have to see the prize.
*  You know, every single morning you wake up, you know, the guy,
*  the guy that you're going to fight, you know, that wasn't there.
*  That wasn't there when I woke up in the morning.
*  So I didn't feel like I was preparing in the proper way.
*  So something that was at this level.
*  So you don't just need 10 weeks for your body.
*  You want it for your mind as well.
*  That's the most. Yeah.
*  I mean, that's the most important part to me.
*  I've been training since I was four.
*  My body is my body is a machine.
*  You know, I do.
*  I didn't know I can get ready in that amount of time.
*  That's what it comes down to.
*  I had no idea because I've never tried it.
*  But I wasn't better.
*  I had done better between fights since since I fought cowboy than I had ever done
*  between fights in in the in the in the fact that I was staying in shape running.
*  You know, I had treadmill at my house.
*  I was still sparring. I never I took like two months off sparring three months off sparring.
*  But then I was sparring for three, four months before I got that call, you know, to to get in there and fight.
*  You made a crazy shift in your career in that you started off as this wrestler.
*  But when I first started watching you fight in World Series of Fighting, I was like,
*  look at how this motherfucker throws leg kicks.
*  It was kind of crazy.
*  Like you would throw leg kicks while you were working the body like in close.
*  Like even you know, everybody's got their own sort of way of moving.
*  Like everybody's body mechanics are different.
*  But you were throwing these like crazy in close leg kicks.
*  Like you'd be like on top of people and you were chopping at their legs.
*  When did you make this shift?
*  Because you don't take anybody down now, which is kind of nuts.
*  If you really think about the fact that you were an all American wrestler and your your bases in wrestling,
*  you have not had a single fucking takedown attempt in the UFC.
*  No, but I, you know, I got taken down for for two seconds with Michael Johnson rocked me.
*  I don't know how they count takedowns in this sport, but it's certainly not like wrestling.
*  Not a legit takedown.
*  Eddie and Dustin tried to take me down, but I scrambled right out of that.
*  I was a great defensive wrestler.
*  I wrestled Jordan Burrows twice.
*  You know, the first time I stopped his double leg for two and a half periods.
*  And then, you know, he pretty much collapsed my sternum and I couldn't take a breath for three months after that.
*  But I mean, then then then then I gave in, you know, then it broke.
*  My body broke and I couldn't stop it no more.
*  The second time I wrestled him, I stopped every single, you know, double leg he had.
*  Nobody stops that double leg.
*  Fuck was I going with that?
*  I don't know.
*  God damn it.
*  It's you bad motherfucker.
*  Well, we're talking about your shift between being a wrestler.
*  The hidden.
*  Sorry.
*  So I was a defensive wrestler.
*  I was never a great offensive wrestler.
*  It was it was so hard to take me down.
*  When I was all American, I started in the pigtail round and I beat four or three number eight seed.
*  Number six seed.
*  And I think I beat the number of tens or something.
*  But I gave up the first take down in every single one of those matches.
*  And then they broke because of my defensive pressure.
*  You know, I was constantly hanging on them and my my leg kicks.
*  Wrestlers, they like to separate wrestling from fighting.
*  I'm just doing this.
*  I'm just doing it both in the same thing in the clinch.
*  The clinch is where I'm the most dangerous with those kicks that you're talking about.
*  That's if your hands are on you, you can feel where their weight is shifting, which way they're moving,
*  which way they want to move.
*  And it's just constantly getting to put all their pressure on them on a foot and fire a kick from that range.
*  And that's all wrestling.
*  That's I'm using my wrestling so much when I'm fighting like it's when that's when I hear people say it.
*  And it's so hard to see that with that, even with the untrained or the trained, it'd be hard to see.
*  But I'm wrestling so much in there.
*  Right. I understand that.
*  But that's interesting that your wrestling allows you to do that from the clinch because you have a better understanding
*  about where they're putting their weight because you're manipulating them around.
*  And then when they have the weight on that leg, you're chopping that can't check.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You cannot pick.
*  I was so bummed out.
*  I didn't call them on Michael Johnson fight because I was a big fan of yours.
*  And when you were coming to the UFC, I was like, oh, shit.
*  I was like, this is going to be fun.
*  And then when I found out you were doing that Michael Johnson fight, I was like, fuck.
*  I'm like, I can't call that one.
*  I'm not going to be doing that one.
*  And then I got the chance to watch it.
*  And I believe it was the night before we had a car.
*  Yep.
*  So I watched it in my hotel room on my laptop and I was like, God damn.
*  That was a few fights.
*  I'm like, fuck.
*  I wish I called that fight because that fight was madness.
*  That was just mad.
*  I've had so much fun with him in the quarter.
*  Like it's I've giggled a few times.
*  And right before he got stopped by Poirier, he said something to me in the corner just made me crack up.
*  He sits down and he's like, he don't even hit hard.
*  I just look at him and I'm just like, dude, you just have so much fun in there.
*  He really enjoys the fight.
*  He enjoys the process.
*  And I've worked with a lot of athletes and when most people say it, they don't mean that at all.
*  They're psyching themselves up.
*  And he is so unique.
*  He loves to be in there.
*  When it's fight night, he'll say, he said it to me twice and I was like, oh really?
*  Because he's like, fucking nervous.
*  And I'm like, really?
*  And he's like, because I'm not nervous at all.
*  I don't understand why I can't do anything.
*  He's like, dude, it's fucking weird.
*  He goes, I just lost my last two fights.
*  That's when he was fighting Vic.
*  And he's like, I'm so nervous because I'm not nervous.
*  I should be.
*  I was like, this is Vic, dude.
*  I need to be on point.
*  I don't understand why I'm not feeling anything.
*  Yeah, that was the Vic fight was very interesting because that was one of the first times we got to see real animosity from you two.
*  You were genuinely pissed off at him.
*  I could tell he was talking a lot of shit about how you're a human punching bag and he was going to knock you out.
*  You could see you were genuinely angry at him.
*  I was backed into a corner.
*  I'm human, man.
*  I had to fight back.
*  So yeah, I was defending myself mostly, but I was in such a tough spot coming off too long.
*  I knew what I had.
*  I knew I had the skills.
*  I knew.
*  And it was just.
*  Well, both of those fights were very close fights too.
*  Very similar.
*  Eddie Alvarez is one fight of the year.
*  So Michael Johnson, Eddie Alvarez doesn't play.
*  My first three fights in the UFC, 2017, 2018, they were voted top three out of five.
*  That's out of 958 fights.
*  That's what I did.
*  And I only got paid half for those two fights.
*  That's what hurt me the most.
*  But they were both real similar too in the fact that you almost stopped both those guys with leg kicks.
*  And they were similar in the fact how I lost.
*  I became complacent.
*  I was having too much fun.
*  I forgot that I was fighting the best of the best.
*  And I love it too much.
*  And not having the crowd there, I think it helped me so much.
*  And I think it's going to, whether there's crowd or no crowd in the future, I think it's going to benefit me so much.
*  Because I was able to understand that the crowd does influence my emotions.
*  And my only rule is never allow someone or something to affect or control your emotions.
*  And I wasn't aware that the crowd was having that effect on my emotions.
*  And the fact that I would have engaged more.
*  I would have taken more chances in that fight with Tony.
*  And I didn't do that because I think I was able to be in control of my emotions for the whole time, for every second.
*  That's interesting because that fight was so wild.
*  If there was a crowd there for that fight, holy shit.
*  Yeah, I would have engaged.
*  It would have been a crazy crowd.
*  I mean, if that was T-Mobile Arena, holy shit.
*  I mean, that would have been madness.
*  That fight was so crazy.
*  It would have been crazy.
*  But it was super unique to be able to be a part of something like that with no crowd.
*  So it was like, it was super cool.
*  Like he's going on and saying that he would have.
*  I don't know if he would have.
*  Because if you look at the three fights prior to that, there's a huge difference in your range and your balance shoulders.
*  Like he's out range.
*  You out range, Vic.
*  You still pressure, but he's got balanced shoulders now.
*  He used to be front heavy, and that was a pressure fighter.
*  He was, his weight was on the front leg and he was pointed with the head.
*  Now he's level shoulder where his range is just crazy.
*  Like with Tony, Tony was like he couldn't find you with your range and your speed and your balance.
*  Which is Tony's strength.
*  Totally.
*  And Tony will push you back, hit you with combos all the way back to the cage.
*  Ours was dominate the center of the cage and use your footwork.
*  Like keep him off balance.
*  And that's what he's done well in his last four fights.
*  And we shifted game plans completely when I had the conversation with him because he was like, because after the first loss, it wasn't much change that he wanted.
*  He still wanted to fight that way.
*  After the second one, he's like, I need to change something.
*  I'm like, what's your purpose?
*  You were the most exciting fighter.
*  And what do you want to be?
*  And he's like, I want to be the champion.
*  I was like, then you have to be intelligent.
*  You have to be intelligent.
*  To be the best fighter in the world, you've got to be the best defensive fighter.
*  Don't change who you are naturally.
*  But you have to understand defense.
*  Defense starts with position.
*  Always starts with position.
*  You have to know position.
*  You have to win every position.
*  Well, you came into a real crossroads, right?
*  Because you were this incredibly exciting contender.
*  You come into the UFC, giant prospect.
*  Everybody's excited.
*  You have this fucking chaotic war that reaffirms everybody's hopes and aspirations.
*  Like this is what we were hoping.
*  Justin Gage is going to come to the UFC.
*  Holy shit, this is going to be wild, man.
*  This motherfucker doesn't care.
*  He throws down.
*  You throw down with Michael Johnson like, ah.
*  And then you have those two losses in a row.
*  And people think, OK, is he in over his head?
*  Does that style only work on the lower level guys?
*  And you get to championship caliber guys.
*  But you know, Dustin's never held the title, but he's a championship caliber guy.
*  And so is Eddie Alvarez.
*  He's a championship caliber guy.
*  He won the title.
*  So you're looking at those two guys like maybe when you get to that point, maybe he's not ready for this.
*  Or maybe he doesn't have the style.
*  So then you make this adjustment.
*  So tell me what that was like.
*  You sit back.
*  You guys have this conversation.
*  You say you want to be a world champion.
*  And then what changed in your head?
*  So he can tell it so much better than me because for me, I can't explain it because it's never been anything.
*  It's just do what I'm told to do when I show up and work my hardest.
*  Like that's all it is every day for me.
*  I didn't make a decision.
*  I think it was a choice, obviously.
*  But you said you wanted to be a champion now.
*  Instead of being the most exciting fighter, you wanted to be a champion.
*  Yes.
*  What was that shift?
*  So I always wanted to be a champion.
*  I thought I could be a champion.
*  I was undefeated.
*  I thought I could be a champion with the style that I was fighting because I was not losing.
*  I had seven amateur fights, 18 professional fights, 25 fights in a row.
*  I had no idea that I needed to change.
*  I was just going in there and I was breaking people.
*  I was like, I can't not break anybody.
*  I'm going to go in there and break everybody because everybody's breaking for some reason.
*  And then when I lost to Eddie and Dustin, I watched them many times and I understood that it was the same mistake.
*  You can't get hit.
*  I was winning.
*  I thought I was winning those fights.
*  Judges scorecards maybe don't resemble that.
*  But I thought I was winning those fights.
*  The night after I fought Dustin Poirier, I went out and took 200 pictures with all my fans at the bar.
*  He was in the hospital probably or guaranteed he wasn't on his feet because he didn't walk for a month.
*  So I just understood that no matter how bad you cause damage, if they don't go down and they land that shot, then it all goes away.
*  And I got paid half of my money.
*  I didn't understand.
*  I had never got paid half my money.
*  Did you know or did you not think about it?
*  I knew, but I never thought about that shit.
*  I don't like that.
*  For people like me, I wouldn't argue for the whole roster.
*  And there's very few like me.
*  But I'm going to go to war for myself when it comes to that.
*  You're going to fight your hardest no matter what you're saying.
*  And you don't need that bonus, the win bonus to motivate.
*  You're not going to incentivize me to win, to save my own life?
*  What the hell do I need that for?
*  I don't like it.
*  I don't like it for the athlete.
*  And I think there's oftentimes where you would say, oh, it forces guys to try to keep it out of the hands of the judges.
*  Well, that's crazy.
*  You can't decide that.
*  I'm going to keep it.
*  That one statement, don't put it, leave it in the hands of the judges.
*  That one statement drives me fucking crazy because that's not how to fight.
*  That's the one statement that drives me the most crazy.
*  My mom said it once like probably four years ago.
*  I was like, Mom, don't you ever say that again.
*  Don't you ever say it.
*  And I told her why.
*  I was like, these guys are trying their hardest.
*  You think they're in their minds like, oh, let's leave it to the judges.
*  Like, no, they're just fighting for their life.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  You know, and, you know, chance didn't fall in their favor when it comes to a knockout, whatever you want, however you want to put it.
*  I mean, take away all the criticisms that we all have for judging and just the idea that somehow or another you can make this decision to go knock this guy out who's a world class fighter trying to knock you out.
*  That's a great way to get knocked out.
*  And when you're fighting, you have to fight correctly.
*  And I think me watching as an observer, what shifted with you is you just seem to be more calculated in your aggression.
*  All the aggression is still there.
*  Yeah. The big fight. Just spots.
*  The Barbosa fight, dude.
*  You got right on top of that motherfucker.
*  And he's one of the scariest strikers in the division.
*  You got right on top of him.
*  Super impressive knockout because you you just met you figure the distance out perfectly, but you put a tremendous amount of pressure on him.
*  But your distance was excellent.
*  Like to avoid you were avoiding, but yet you were still there when you wanted to hit him.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Just yeah, thinking going in there with the, you know, to be methodical.
*  I'd never had a method.
*  My only method was create car crashes, create a car crash.
*  Be the physics.
*  Both have the same weight, same force.
*  If I can create more force and be there first, then I'm going to win this car crash.
*  That's usually how it works.
*  And the issue was when you're fighting in a high heart rate, you get your light lazy spots where you start to get on your heels a little bit.
*  And you lose your accuracy.
*  You lose your sharpness.
*  You lose your your your power.
*  You're maxed out in your heart rate.
*  And that's why his finishes.
*  I feel like you're way sharper now and you still fight like you're always going to fight the way you do.
*  It's in you.
*  You love the fight.
*  But in spots is key.
*  And you're still walking them down.
*  You're still pressuring them.
*  You're still being able to do those things.
*  We didn't change much outside of now.
*  He fights in spots.
*  It's amazing.
*  What did I say specifically?
*  I never specifically went to you.
*  No, you said you wanted to be a champion.
*  And I was like, we got to get a lot more technical.
*  It was other than that.
*  And we talked about spots.
*  We said we said you got to fight more in spots.
*  So it was really also to win when I'm watching him.
*  I watch every session and and I tell them, you know, you're going too hard.
*  You need to pull back.
*  This won't go out and you're only able to use your lead hand.
*  So now you can't throw power.
*  You can only control someone and he'll still walk people down.
*  But it takes away him throwing so many combinations or hooking four at a time.
*  You know, and and and he's able to create these patterns that's better.
*  You're controlling range, you're controlling position and then waiting for mistakes.
*  The best fighters in the world can always match a good match.
*  But it's the first one that makes a mistake is the one who loses.
*  That's where it and momentum is so important in sports.
*  Momentum is everything.
*  That snowball.
*  Once it starts to build, it's so hard to recover and turn that around in high competition.
*  It's a mental thing.
*  But when you can control things and control and control and then find one mistake
*  and then you build on that mistake, you're like a wave.
*  You slowly get a little bigger and you slowly get a little bigger.
*  Now you start to capitalize because once they make a mistake, that pattern is starting to create.
*  And then once you got someone make a mistake after a mistake after a mistake, that's when you crumble on them.
*  And I feel like that's what he's done really well.
*  The three fights prior to that, he was just to capitalize, able to capitalize on the big mistake.
*  But credit to Tony.
*  Tony is one of the most gangster dudes in this sport.
*  And for him to go through the damage that he did and continue to walk forward is something unique.
*  Incredible.
*  It is one of the coolest things to experience as a coach to sit there and watch his mental not change.
*  Even when he because I was calling for the ref to stop the fight at about halfway through the fifth round.
*  And when he got hit with that last jab and shook his head, I don't think it was a point like, oh, I don't want to go on no more.
*  I don't know if it was the orbital because I know he had an orbital issue, but there was something going on where his body is telling him not to do it.
*  But his mental is like, no, don't stop.
*  You go and you still kick it and punch it.
*  Even with the big old gash on his his shin from the check, he was still kicking like never flinched.
*  He never flinched.
*  He was getting cracked and he'd get knocked backwards and then he would go from backwards or right back to forward.
*  It was it was super unique to watch.
*  But again, it was it was great to see someone who can listen and understand that if you stay in control yourself, that's the key to everything in this world.
*  If you listen to anything else on the outside and you start to adapt to other things, you're never going to live the way you want to live.
*  And to be a fighter, you have to be in control yourself all the time.
*  I always say the best fighters are the best actors, the ones that can trick theirself.
*  Fake it till you make it till you get to the championship.
*  And you have to live that way.
*  You have to obsess never being broken.
*  And even if you break, accept it and then on to the next.
*  Don't deal with it. Oh, man, I had such a bad day.
*  This one of my biggest pet peeves that I hate is hearing someone.
*  Oh, man, today was a shitty day.
*  And I was like, yeah, there's going to be many more shitty days, but accept it.
*  Yeah. Love it.
*  Does you zero good.
*  Sit around and talk about shitty days.
*  Totally. I have fighters say, man, you always saying just positive shit.
*  You always just like it.
*  I'm like, hell, yeah, you got to love every part of it.
*  Like I'm going to say beautiful at any point.
*  When I see you get hurt to the body of a crack up, he got kicked in the cup.
*  He had a big old cup.
*  The last fight, he got kicked in the cup.
*  He turned sideways, did the move we were talking about.
*  We got moonwalk where we turned lateral.
*  You don't get the squareness from the front kick.
*  He did it perfect.
*  And he stepped back and aimed at his cup.
*  And I'm like, how did you get hit in your cup?
*  He had a George St. Pierre cup.
*  One of the cup too big for the tights.
*  I laughed and I was like, dude, he hit you in the cup.
*  You know, it's what kind of cup do you use?
*  He forgot his cup in his mouth.
*  Yeah.
*  So the UFC always has one.
*  I just grab one for them.
*  Why?
*  The UFC has a cup.
*  So no, no, it's their new cups.
*  They got I'm not the only one that forgets their cup.
*  OK, so what do they give you?
*  Just like this one was actually a really nice cup.
*  Just just just a cup.
*  And I stick it in my underwear that has a little pocket for the cup.
*  Do you trade trades with no cup?
*  There's so many.
*  But there's so many people that don't trade with cups.
*  Did you know?
*  So Dwayne Ludwig.
*  I.
*  Guys lose balls.
*  Dwayne Ludwig had to get carried out, put in the backseat and and went in went in for some type of surgery.
*  And I wasn't there for that one.
*  He got kicked in the ball and the dude that kicked him in the ball had to accept the fight for him and take the fight that he was training for.
*  But every time he takes a ball shot, I don't let him stop.
*  I'm like, you know, work up.
*  I did not wear a cup.
*  That sounds so crazy.
*  Why did I hit the balls?
*  Yeah, we're in wrestling.
*  And this is not wrestling, but this isn't wrestling cups.
*  Cups are for life and death situations.
*  What?
*  Sparring is not that.
*  Yeah, but you can get kicked in the balls and lose a ball.
*  We've had this conversation.
*  I touched my body.
*  I offer.
*  We're stepping to sparring.
*  I announced nine percent of the time I got five hundred dollars for anybody that could drop me with a body shot.
*  Drop you with a body shot.
*  You got kicked in the balls in your fight with Tony.
*  That was a front kick, like an up kick, and it wouldn't have hit my balls if my cup wasn't so big.
*  That's true.
*  That is true.
*  Honestly, do cups do like, especially in boxing, because I never did martial arts.
*  I did boxing and boxing cups are the worst.
*  They're those no foul protectors.
*  Dude, they don't even, it just sits in the front of you.
*  So you take shots up here and it smashes you.
*  It's like the worst.
*  Have you ever used one of those diamond MMA cups?
*  No, I see people getting kicked with them.
*  I do need a cup, though.
*  Dude, I have some of those laying around.
*  I'll give you one.
*  Diamond sent me a gang of them.
*  I fucking love them.
*  I wear them from Jiu Jitsu.
*  They sit in compression shorts and they're tight.
*  That would probably help, though.
*  It would help.
*  My nuts get smashed all the time in Jiu Jitsu.
*  Jesus Christ, dude.
*  I'm not gonna let you guys do that.
*  Wear a goddamn cup.
*  But are they allowed to wear tie cups, steel tie cups?
*  Yes, they are.
*  I actually seen in one of the fights, because I didn't know if they were able to, because
*  they're steel.
*  But I seen the string coming out.
*  I had to tie up James McSweeney's cup one time and I'm like, bro, how are you wearing
*  that like that?
*  He had the string going up his ass so bad like a thong.
*  So tight.
*  And he's like, tighter, coach, tighter.
*  And I'm sitting here and I'm yanking on this thing and I'm like, dude, how are you gonna
*  fight like that?
*  But it ain't gonna move.
*  It ain't gonna move.
*  And if someone kicks you, it fucking hurts them.
*  I could not imagine steel.
*  Kenny Florian used to fight with a tie steel cup.
*  Totally.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, man, the ties know how to do it.
*  I mean, nobody gets kicked in the nuts more than them, right?
*  They're just throwing leg kicks all the time.
*  They slam shins in the ball sacks all day long and they figured out a way to make that
*  something that you don't want to do.
*  Completely.
*  But it's also a giant lever for arm bars.
*  I've heard about that.
*  When you're grappling, you can really feel it.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's illegal in a lot of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments for that reason.
*  You got both your hooks and dig it into their back.
*  Dig it into their spine.
*  Or it mounts.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We had a guy in our gym that wore one and he mounted me and stuck it in my sternum.
*  I'm like, what the fuck, man?
*  Oh, you son of a bitch.
*  So where's pain?
*  It's like he's got a giant rock.
*  You're just shoving it into your sternum.
*  So when you're sparring, you don't ever feel vulnerable that your balls are just kind of
*  jiggling around there?
*  I mean, I wear some tight boxer briefs, so they're not hanging out.
*  And you're like, all right, whatever.
*  Let them do it.
*  So again, I...
*  He loses a ball.
*  That's a real problem.
*  That's his outside issue.
*  I work for the athlete.
*  That's one thing that is super unique for me.
*  I'm not going to be your father.
*  I'm going to train you.
*  I'm going to give you everything I got.
*  But this is your life.
*  I will save it in many ways I can.
*  But if you're not going to train for it, I'm not going to just sit there and annoy you
*  for it when it comes to...
*  That is the biggest I told you so ever, when you lose a ball.
*  I used to be...
*  When I was a catcher, I didn't wear a cup.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  It's crazy, right?
*  You got to protect yourself.
*  You ever see that video where...
*  You got two hands.
*  Who was it?
*  Dwight Gooden throws that ball and the bird explodes?
*  No, that was Randy Johnson.
*  Randy Johnson.
*  That's right.
*  Really?
*  Randy Johnson.
*  I would wear a cup if I was catching for it.
*  Randy Johnson with a long, old bullet.
*  Have you seen it?
*  He turned his leg all the way up.
*  He had a big tall dude.
*  Have you seen the bird exploding?
*  I haven't seen that one, no.
*  It's kind of hilarious.
*  He's pitching for the Diamondbacks.
*  So he throws his ball and this bird flies right into the line of fire and explodes.
*  It explodes in a burst of feathers.
*  Really?
*  I remember him pitching.
*  He was like the fastest pitcher at the time.
*  Middle of the game.
*  Middle of the game.
*  Middle of the game.
*  So the bird's flying.
*  Here it goes.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Look over here.
*  Oh!
*  Look at this.
*  So he throws it and just perfect timing.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  It just randomly explodes.
*  That's the bird flopping off over in the thing.
*  It just de-feathered it.
*  It de-feathered every feather.
*  He cleaned it.
*  You could cook that like that.
*  You could cook it.
*  Right there.
*  Basically.
*  You could end that fucking bird's...
*  He basically stopped it in his tracks perfectly.
*  It was like the perfect collision.
*  I mean, so what are the odds of that happening?
*  Unbelievable.
*  That'd be really effective in golf.
*  Unbelievable odds.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Sorry to slow-move with you.
*  So, think about your balls, please.
*  I'll get you one of them Diamond MMA cups.
*  Think about your balls.
*  If it's comfortable, wear it.
*  Okay.
*  Jesus.
*  Coach, talk to him.
*  Okay, there's a 0.000009% chance Randy Johnson would hit a bird with any given pitch.
*  Oh my God.
*  How do they come up with that number?
*  Mathematicians, man.
*  No way.
*  So, you get how many pitches have been thrown.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's only been one out of that.
*  That's what I mean.
*  So, that's probably what made that.
*  And then as they continue to go on, that's going to change.
*  Because until they hit a second bird.
*  Never once had a bird been hit with a pitch in the history of baseball before their faithful
*  day with Randy Johnson.
*  That said, each game, team throws around 150 pitches, multiply that by 200,000 and you
*  get 30 million.
*  That's going to change every year for many years.
*  So, the answer is roughly somewhere in the ballpark of 1 in 30 million.
*  Wow.
*  Per season.
*  Yeah, per season, I guess, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  If you were not playing Major League and someone did that, no one's going to believe that story.
*  No one's going to believe that.
*  Ever.
*  Yeah, you'd be like, what?
*  Yeah, my buddy threw the ball.
*  Right when he threw the ball, the bird just was perfectly lined up.
*  Like your buddy's an asshole and he threw a ball at a bird.
*  Tell the truth.
*  He got his feather off.
*  That's funny.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  So, think about your nuts, please.
*  I got you.
*  I got you.
*  Okay, thank you.
*  Diamond cup.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, well, I have a bunch of them back.
*  And he'll be the best father.
*  Like, he is so good with kids.
*  You need to work up, man.
*  Yeah, you want to.
*  I got to find a girl first.
*  Protect the jewels.
*  That's the first part of the equation.
*  Yeah, but don't find a girl right now because that fucks up more fighters than anything.
*  I won't pick the wrong one.
*  I'm sure you won't.
*  But sometimes you don't think you're picking the wrong one.
*  You think you're picking the right one.
*  Then they fucking take their mask off.
*  They're pretty tricky.
*  Oh, they're so tricky.
*  Some of them.
*  Some of them aren't tricky at all.
*  I tell you, I was done.
*  I found my wife, my best friend.
*  I tell you, she was the key.
*  I say all my success.
*  She was someone who supported everything I did, which was so different.
*  And again, having that backbone and having someone to support you is key.
*  You got to have the people that are there for you.
*  When I have the day where I feel weak and I'm like, oh man, I really just don't want
*  to do this.
*  She's like, get up and do this.
*  You got this.
*  And then the days where she needs to pull me back a little bit.
*  Having that balance is key.
*  In this industry, when it comes to athletes, and especially the level that you're at, it
*  is a scary thing.
*  We've seen it.
*  I've seen it change so many people.
*  And it's not just the women.
*  It's outside influences.
*  This is one thing that I love about this guy is he is the same dude from day one.
*  I've had so many athletes just become something different.
*  They get the shell on them.
*  They just become different.
*  And he's just a grounded dude.
*  I call him a yes man because every person that knows him is like, hey man, come over
*  to my house for dinner.
*  And he just can't say no.
*  He's like, all right, cool.
*  I'll be there.
*  You need me to bring you this?
*  That's a good kind of yes man.
*  It's just a great, great thing.
*  He's so good to his family.
*  He's so good to all of his friends.
*  He is very unique.
*  Very unique.
*  And it's always the nice dudes.
*  You see him from the outside.
*  You think, hey man, meathead.
*  He's one of the most intelligent, four people type of fighters.
*  Some of the nicest guys are the ones that perform the best.
*  They're the ones that are going to help a lady across the street.
*  But they fight for something.
*  And that's so unique.
*  There's something to that because I think guys who don't have the burden of guilt, like
*  laying on their head that they're an asshole.
*  Even if you're a sociopath, if you act like a piece of shit, no matter how much you justify,
*  I'm the fucking man who gives a shit.
*  In the back of your head, you got to know you're a piece of shit.
*  False confidence.
*  Yes, it's false confidence.
*  That's why everyone's so scared to make that walk.
*  Or you reword it.
*  There's no reason you should be scared.
*  If you've done everything, what are you scared of?
*  You probably didn't eat the right things.
*  You probably didn't go to sleep right.
*  You probably drank too much alcohol.
*  You did something and no, you can't lie to yourself.
*  He's talking about being an asshole though.
*  That's part of it as well.
*  They can reword that and be like, I'm the shit.
*  The piece of the shit.
*  You know, you reword that.
*  It's a psyche, right?
*  I'm the shit.
*  Everyone's like, no, you're the piece of shit.
*  I've thought about that with a lot of fighters, that they get into trouble.
*  I wonder how much that fucks with them.
*  And also, in today's day and age, with social media, if you're an asshole, if you do mean
*  things, people find out about it and they're like, that guy's a piece of shit.
*  Fuck him.
*  And then you feel the sting of that.
*  And then you're getting out there and you're getting booed.
*  You see that fuck with guys.
*  It makes a big impact.
*  Those are the hardest guys to retire to.
*  Once they don't have it no more, it's a rough thing.
*  That's been a hard thing for me as a coach, is seeing the end.
*  That's why I'm so into life coaching, not just coaching.
*  It's coaching them about life that, hey man, you're the same dude as anybody out here.
*  You're challenging yourself.
*  Yes, you are doing something at a different level and going out there and chasing things,
*  but don't let it change who you are to people.
*  You have everything now.
*  When you're a champion, you go into any restaurant.
*  They're going to give you free dinner, feed your family.
*  It doesn't matter who's with you.
*  But when you lose, all of a sudden everybody drops their head.
*  They feel bad for you.
*  They're like, oh my god, that guy just got knocked out.
*  It's very hard to step away from.
*  And you see guys that continue to fight for way too long because they need that feeling.
*  They need that invincibleness again, that stardom, that kingdom.
*  And that's hard for me to watch because that's a challenge.
*  You see a lot of people go down the wrong end.
*  It's also their identity.
*  When they're not fighting, they don't know who they are.
*  Because first of all, fighting is so much more exciting than anything else you're ever
*  going to do.
*  So if you get used to these gigantic highs and then preparing and then the nerves of
*  preparing and all the anticipation of these big events, fighters have the riskiest job
*  in the world outside of first responders, soldiers, and people along those lines.
*  You're literally playing a game called I'm trying to throw my bones and separate you
*  from your consciousness and you're going to try to do that to me.
*  And you're doing it publicly in front of everybody.
*  So there's emotions, there's physical.
*  You know about, everybody knows about the damage that it does to your body.
*  It's so, there's so much riding on it that for fighters when they leave that and then
*  they go to a regular life, like a lot of times it's very difficult, very difficult to make
*  that adjustment.
*  There's so many of them come back.
*  Yep.
*  And that's why it needs to be guided from day one.
*  And again, you have to have a time.
*  Your goal, you have to set goal sets.
*  We've talked about when your time is up and how long you're going to fight for.
*  You have to set those goals.
*  You have to be true to them.
*  That's like not taking a last minute fight.
*  You have to have your goals set into place and once you start to break those rules, you're
*  really not grabbing the wheel.
*  You're letting it coast and then that's where you start to spiral downhill or go off track.
*  I think that's super important because you can only do any sport for so long, but all
*  athletes, like even in NFL and things like that, they think they're going to play forever.
*  They have this mindset that you're going to play forever, but it's so hard to see what
*  happens to them after the lights go out.
*  Yeah, very hard.
*  Very hard.
*  Most athletes, pro athletes wind up going broke.
*  I mean, it's the vast majority of NFL players are bankrupt within just a couple of years
*  of retiring.
*  Same thing with NBA players.
*  And mentally bankrupt.
*  Mentally bankrupt.
*  They can't earn.
*  They don't want to earn.
*  They almost get self-sabotage.
*  Like again, it's, you know, I'm kicking my ass.
*  Again, they start to beat their own self up.
*  And that takes a lot of work too.
*  I mean, that feeling after being in that octagon and winning is the highest of high.
*  I've never ever experienced anything like it.
*  I focus, as soon as I leave, I really focus on bringing myself down and not being too
*  high for too long because with the highs come the lows.
*  And I'm constantly in the middle.
*  So when do you do that?
*  Like right after the Tony fight?
*  How long after?
*  I walk like two minutes after.
*  I walk, you know, you're going through the whole process, but that whole time through
*  the process is like, for one, you're ain't special.
*  You're not special.
*  That was awesome.
*  But back to normal.
*  It's immediate.
*  Right?
*  Immediate.
*  Right when I was talking to you, I was like, you know, my finger hurts, but other than
*  that, it's like,
*  You seem pretty normal.
*  Yeah, nothing.
*  The only thing that wasn't normal, you threw the belt away.
*  Like, get that fucking thing out of here.
*  I want the real one.
*  I don't know why I did that.
*  I mean, that's the competitor in me, you know?
*  Right.
*  You know, Dustin won one of those and as you stated, he was never a champion.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, so, but he did win it.
*  He won the interim title.
*  So in the future,
*  He's a championship caliber, but and so was Tony.
*  I mean, Tony was an interim champion as well, but interim titles are very weird.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  It's like, I kind of think they shouldn't exist.
*  Yeah, it's definitely not a real belt.
*  It's more real than the BMF belt, but.
*  It's just one of those.
*  Every time I hear that, I think the Cowboys like ranch.
*  Because you've got BMF everywhere.
*  I know.
*  I always think of that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's called the BMF ranch.
*  Yeah.
*  The BMF belt was fun, but it was fun.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  I loved it.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  It was entertainment.
*  We got to, and remember, belts, whether the interim or not, you get pay-per-view by.
*  So again, there's the, we got to look at the pros and the cons.
*  I don't know about that belt.
*  It does benefit the athletes.
*  I hope so.
*  No, but I'm talking about the interim.
*  The interim, right?
*  No, I'm in.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why.
*  That was one huge factor.
*  For one, I've always said I don't take late replacement fights, but I never said I don't
*  take late replacement world title fights.
*  This is way different.
*  Just the implications.
*  It was different.
*  You had a statement.
*  One of the things you said when you first entered the UFC, you said, I'm going to put
*  on some incredible fights and I'm going to lose and I'm probably going to get knocked
*  out.
*  Nobody says that.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's true.
*  It's the craziest thing.
*  He says it was so, you say it all the time.
*  I'm like, stop saying that shit because you use repeat shit.
*  You're going to trick yourself.
*  Then we get knocked out.
*  But that's the key to him.
*  He doesn't hesitate.
*  If I do anything as a coach, I got to pull him back.
*  That's a great thing.
*  I've been a motivator my whole career.
*  The psychology.
*  I'm a great technician, but my psychology is tricking people to win.
*  How do you get out there and do it?
*  Making them believe you have to force your head into something to make something happen.
*  You have to go out there and fight.
*  That's hard for a lot of people.
*  This guy is pulling people back is a great thing.
*  It's still hard to do at times.
*  Did fighters go too hard to hit rage?
*  Rage is hard to settle down.
*  When someone hits rage, someone says something about your mama.
*  I'm always like, they don't even know your mama.
*  Stop that shit.
*  Stop.
*  There was a great moment after the second round, after you got hit with that uppercut.
*  You came back to the corner and you told them, take something off your punches.
*  Take about 10% off.
*  Just hit them with clean shots.
*  You're trying to murder them with every shot.
*  Then you made that adjustment.
*  That was really interesting because a lot of times coaches will tell stuff to fighters
*  and the fighters probably know somewhere in their head, but it's fucking with them that
*  they're starting to get tired.
*  It's fucking with them that they got hit and then they lose some composure.
*  They get emotional and they go out there and they want to make mistakes.
*  You immediately adjusted and you went out there and you would see by the end of that
*  second round when Tony hit you with that shot, people were like, well, maybe this is a shift
*  in the direction of the fight.
*  Nope.
*  The shift was the opposite way.
*  You came out in the third round more technical and you came out and did exactly what Trevor
*  said.
*  We worked long and hard on that.
*  I trust him with everything as he said.
*  He wouldn't be my coach if I didn't trust him with my life and with everything I go
*  in there to do.
*  When he said that to you, when he said take 10% off.
*  The crazy thing is you only see 10% of the interaction between us in between rounds.
*  Right now I'm actually with talking to the UFC trying to get that whole thing.
*  But yeah, I got hit hard.
*  You're talking to the UFC trying to get what though?
*  Recording?
*  He's trying to get his audio from his mic.
*  You want to hear it and watch it?
*  I don't remember it.
*  Just like when he come to me in the fifth round and I was laughing, I had just asked,
*  the reason I was laughing is because I had just asked him, I said, was that the end of
*  the second or third round?
*  And they're like, this is the fifth round.
*  I was like, no fucking way I'm in that good of shape.
*  I was like, no way.
*  And that's when they cut in.
*  So you don't see, there's so much you don't see in that interaction between me and him.
*  It's so important for fighters to see that adjustment and how his endurance leveled off.
*  Because it was like you were having these wild exchanges and you were fucking hitting
*  Tony.
*  First of all, Tony Ferguson is made out of metal.
*  It's crazy.
*  What in the fuck?
*  Especially when you're talking about a body type, like you were talking earlier about
*  someone with a frail body type, he doesn't have a chiseled neck.
*  He's not built like Mark Hunt.
*  It's so unique to me.
*  He's so tough.
*  He's so fucking tough.
*  Is it a choice to go to sleep or not?
*  But there's also a key.
*  If a fighter can take something on understanding coachability, you have to have your reactions,
*  but you also have to have your responses.
*  Reactive stuff is like jabs.
*  Positional stuff is reactive.
*  You have to be able to react to positions first.
*  I love Jiu Jitsu because it's position before submission.
*  You have to react to positions before anything else.
*  So there's reactive stuff.
*  But the responses is why you have a co-pilot.
*  To help you see what you can see and start noticing that.
*  Or how are you playing defense and using a jab to find openings where you're still working,
*  but you're thinking and going, oh, every time he does this, he's dropping his hand and you're
*  able to see things.
*  That's where you have to be responsive and you have to be aware in the moment where a
*  lot of times people can't.
*  They just bite down.
*  They just bite down on that mouthpiece.
*  And very similar to the way you used to fight was bite down, their eyes are getting big.
*  That's my response is like continue to do this and they're going to fall.
*  And again, that is a very important point is a coach and the athlete understanding.
*  I am there to help you with your responses in the gym.
*  I'm going to create your reactions.
*  I'm going to create your patterns, your basic fundamental patterns that's going to help
*  you win positions and slightly win rounds where you're controlling the fight.
*  The other piece is how am I slowly creating momentum to get finishes?
*  It was pretty stunning how well you adapted and then also how your endurance leveled off.
*  Because you did seem like you were slowing down a little bit at the second round, but
*  it was because you were sprinting, because you were throwing these full power fucking
*  haymakers.
*  But then when you leveled off in that third round, then it's like you had an endless gas
*  tank.
*  That was interesting.
*  You're in control yourself.
*  When you're in control of your visions, it's a lot easier on your psyche.
*  When you're trying to just fight out of things all the time, again, you're not in control.
*  If you can't control your thought, you cannot control your breathing.
*  How stunned were you that Tony could take those shots?
*  In the fight, there's no point where I even understand.
*  You weren't thinking at all, just throwing them.
*  You know, it was crazy.
*  The shots I hit Vic, Barboza, and Sironi with, I was so surprised they went to sleep.
*  I didn't understand why.
*  I think it was position mostly, but yeah, when I was hitting him with some of those
*  shots, especially the one when I came through and he was throwing an uppercut, I couldn't
*  believe he didn't go to sleep with that.
*  But I go back to the Michael Johnson fight, when he hit me with that left hand, there's
*  no reason I shouldn't have went to sleep then.
*  So I haven't figured that part of the equation out.
*  The Johnson is a very good left hand.
*  See, when he knocked out Poirier with that same punch.
*  One of the sharpest left hands.
*  And I was turning through it and it was on the chin.
*  It was everything a knockout shot should be.
*  I don't know why I didn't go to sleep.
*  I got to figure that part out.
*  I know how people go to sleep.
*  I don't know how they don't go to sleep.
*  It's random.
*  It's weird.
*  I mean, sometimes guys take head kicks, full on head kicks, and they don't go to sleep.
*  It's position.
*  It's position.
*  Everything is position.
*  Can you base?
*  Can you lock down?
*  Did you see it?
*  Did you see it?
*  Can you base?
*  I don't see it.
*  You ain't bracing for it.
*  So you're letting your, it's again, linear or rotational is what's causing a concussion.
*  And when you don't see a shot, those are the ones that cause the most damage.
*  If you're able to brace for it and bite down on the punch, it's a lot better.
*  So a lot of times when you're seeing two hooks, both people hook it.
*  I throw like this.
*  I turn away and then all of a sudden I come and I don't see it.
*  I'm causing that head on collision, but I'm not braced for it.
*  I'm not leaning against the wall where if I see a hook coming, I've got my head carrying
*  my weight and able to take the shot.
*  So a lot of times it's the shots you don't see coming and that's the timing.
*  But there are people who will punch you in any moment and you're going to go to sleep.
*  Yeah, that's punching power.
*  So that's like one of the craziest thing in this world.
*  No, if it was, Tony would have went to sleep.
*  I'm telling you, I've seen people who don't hit.
*  My balls were on one foot when I touched them.
*  Hey, you're low kick.
*  So was Cavalier.
*  Your low kick for many years wasn't thrown with the right technique.
*  When you kick people, they're like, oh my gosh, you have a sharp, heavy bone.
*  It's so unique.
*  I've got dense bones.
*  I've got the densest bones in the UFC.
*  There you go.
*  So there's a spot.
*  So they've done a scan on you?
*  Well, they said they can't confirm or deny I've got the densest bones in the UFC.
*  They can't run it out, right?
*  They have a DEXA scan at the UFCPI.
*  You lay there, inch by inch scans your whole body, tells you what you're made of.
*  Your bones are denser than Yoel's?
*  I would assume so.
*  That seems crazy.
*  That guy doesn't seem like he's from this planet.
*  You know, they sent him, you want to hear a crazy story about Yoel?
*  I've repeated on the podcast, but I'll say it anyway.
*  When he had some sort of a fracture of his orbital, they sent him to a doctor.
*  And the doctor examines him and then calls the UFC and goes, where did you find this
*  guy?
*  And he goes, yeah, he goes, he's a fucking specimen, huh?
*  He goes, no, no, no, no.
*  I've never seen a human like him.
*  He goes, I've been practicing medicine for more than 40 years.
*  He goes, the ligaments, the tendons in his eye are three times larger than a normal human's.
*  They're like everything about him.
*  And Dana told me this.
*  And I was talking to Dana about it.
*  And I was talking to my friends who know the whole Cuban program over there, the Cuban
*  athletic program.
*  And of course, he was on the Cuban Olympic team.
*  They said, they did some fucking experiments down there, son.
*  They did some 100% experiments.
*  It's not just incredible genetics, which for sure he has.
*  But he might be a part of some goddamn, like Karelin.
*  They used to call him the experiment.
*  The wrestler from Russia, that guy who was built like a fucking superhero and just threw
*  people around like ragdolls, 300 pound men.
*  It's crazy.
*  They would try to flatten out so he couldn't hoist them up.
*  And he'd get his hands on her and fucking,
*  rawr!
*  And just hoist him over his head.
*  They called him the experiment because his parents were like 5'5".
*  He had these little tiny parents.
*  And he was this gigantic gorilla.
*  It's crazy.
*  I wonder if there's any doctor out there that's ever talked about me and said, man, you have
*  never seen a specimen that's just all ligaments and bones, right?
*  He's missing muscle.
*  He throws everything with perfect technique because he has no muscle.
*  He's not trying to muscle shit.
*  Well, there's something about guys that are strong.
*  In Jiu Jitsu, it's actually kind of a disadvantage for learning because you can power out a thing
*  so you don't develop proper technique.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to learn from a little guy like a Hoyler Gracie or Eddie Bravo or these small
*  guys.
*  They're not overpowering anybody.
*  You think there's something to that.
*  Luis Gracie was...
*  Yeah, perfect example.
*  Perfect example.
*  And then with striking, it's kind of in a similar mode.
*  The really technical guys are the guys who have...
*  Floyd.
*  Floyd's not knocking anybody out with one punch.
*  It has to be technical.
*  He always had brittle hands.
*  He was always hurting himself.
*  That's a...
*  You know, the cool thing about boxing is the sweet science.
*  How many years has it been around?
*  And there's just so much involved with that.
*  But you're seeing a huge shift in MMA where it is so, so, so special.
*  With your fight, it's super unique, again, going back to position and footwork.
*  The footwork is the key.
*  People will talk about the punches and pulling stuff off the punches.
*  From the eye, when I watch it, I'm just like, man, it's keeping someone off balance where
*  their step is one, just a point of a second behind you.
*  You can control the timing.
*  You can control when you punch.
*  And that is such...
*  It's a dance.
*  There's a lead.
*  When there's two dancers, there's a lead.
*  And you have to lead the steps.
*  If you're leading the steps, you got them coming to you.
*  And that's creating that pattern.
*  And man, we can just...
*  Like, that's one of my favorite things to teach is just footwork.
*  Like understanding position.
*  How do you make someone a one-handed fighter or only able to use one side of their body?
*  Because they can only put one weight on one side.
*  And timing the foot when there's a foot off the ground, they can't base, they can't block
*  until that foot hits the ground.
*  So it's those in-between beats.
*  But those are the spots that I could just geek out about and just have so much fun.
*  But the technique is so key.
*  People who are born with gifts and going back to how people just punch differently.
*  Some people just...
*  Whether it's heavy bones, some people, you look at them and their technique is nothing.
*  And you're like, holy cow, they can hit.
*  Yeah, some people just have crazy power.
*  We were talking earlier about Alex Pereira, the guy who fights in glory.
*  That motherfucker knocks everybody out.
*  He's the guy who knocked out Stylebender.
*  He knocks out everybody.
*  He's got crazy power.
*  He's built strong, he looks like a strong guy, but there's something about his power
*  that is greater than whatever you would expect that comes from him.
*  Chris Liebman, you remember Chris Liebman?
*  Oh yeah.
*  He didn't feel like an athlete at all.
*  And that guy, every time he hit someone, they were reacting big time.
*  And you know he had thunder in his hands.
*  He really did.
*  And he could take a shot really well too.
*  And that's, again, a super unique thing is taking the shots.
*  He would plant his feet hard.
*  He had a base.
*  Very ploddy, very heavy base.
*  But that cost him when he fought Anderson.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Because Anderson timed it.
*  Yeah.
*  Another sharpshooter who would hit you at the certain times where you can't, like when
*  he caught force, coming in and attacking him.
*  Like just beautiful.
*  Working backwards and still creating that much leverage and causing a head-on collision
*  as you're pulling your hips away.
*  Super, super unique.
*  It's all timing.
*  I always say I have like six songs going on in my head during a fight.
*  It's like a reggae song.
*  It's a country song.
*  Do you?
*  Do you have songs going on in your head?
*  No.
*  But that's what I'm dancing to.
*  You know, I'm constantly changing rhythms.
*  And if you're constantly changing rhythms, they can't find a pattern.
*  If you can't find a pattern, you can constantly catch them in between them trying to find
*  it.
*  And that's what I'm doing in there.
*  My feet are dancing.
*  I'm on escape.
*  So are you actually thinking of the songs though?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Not...
*  But you're just moving like as if you were...
*  ...in intuition as if I'm never on one beat.
*  If you watch my fights, I'm on 10 different beats.
*  Just to mix it up and to be unpredictable and to offer different looks.
*  To make them...
*  The first thing that happens in a fight is distance control.
*  Someone's going to control distance.
*  It might shift early, you know, back and forth, but it's going to be established within the
*  first minute.
*  That is the most important thing of any fight that will ever happen in a fight, I believe.
*  Because once that's established, the person who establishes it is going to be able to
*  control the rhythm.
*  And then once you can control the rhythm, now you can make them dance to your tune.
*  Once they're dancing to your tune, you're fucking smoking them.
*  As a coach, when Tony Ferguson decided to make weight even though the fight was off,
*  and then wound up fighting just a few weeks later for real, like the April 18th fight,
*  the Tai Chi Palace fight, he just decided to make weight.
*  A lot of people were pretty impressed by it, me included.
*  But then a lot of people were saying afterwards, like, hey, what if he has to fight again in
*  four weeks?
*  That's like, you got to pay for that.
*  He's not a 155 pound guy.
*  He's a 170 plus pound guy.
*  He's not young.
*  No, 37.
*  Actually, we were in contract to fight again.
*  He still was going to make weight.
*  I weighed 178 that day.
*  He said, you want to make weight?
*  I was like, hell no, I'm not making weight.
*  What are you fucking talking about?
*  Well, you also had all them donuts a few days before.
*  I don't ever look at that stuff, Joe, and think anything because again, I'm starting
*  to think about them and get distracted.
*  Right, but as a coach, forget about the fight.
*  The fight's over and gone.
*  Never a person who sets something in stone and say that's a good thing or bad thing.
*  Every person is different.
*  Like if they fight at a lower weight and it's cool for them and they need to hold that weight
*  better, and you're going in a five round fight compared to a three round, there's so many
*  different variables that go into it.
*  I've got to treat each.
*  I don't know.
*  I honestly probably would almost all the time, not going to say never, but yeah, probably
*  not going to do that.
*  But mock cuts are good for you.
*  If you have issues making weight, sometimes a mock cut is good because it gets you down
*  to a point first.
*  There's so many people that cut so much weight the week of the fight that I think that's
*  a huge issue.
*  So I really didn't look at it as that big of a deal.
*  I was like, you know what?
*  It's better than just waiting till the last minute because that is where there's huge
*  danger in this sport.
*  How much do you cut?
*  Not a lot.
*  This was the easiest cut of my life.
*  So you diet down, you train down, and then you cut how many pounds?
*  When I got there I was 165.
*  Oh, so not bad.
*  165.
*  Yeah, but you hit 63 twice prior to going there.
*  Prior to going there I hit 63 twice the week before.
*  None of my guys cut a lot of weight.
*  I don't allow it.
*  I think it's the most dangerous thing.
*  I think again, it's not natural for your body.
*  You're detoxing everything.
*  You're taking everything out of your system.
*  Again, what weight are you really going to fight at?
*  On Thursday night we did one workout at night and I was 163.4 when I started.
*  Worked out for an hour and 20 minutes.
*  When I got off I was 156.6.
*  I was amazed at how much I had just cut.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah, so I went to bed.
*  I went and drank eight ounces of coconut water.
*  Went to bed, woke up 156.2, 156.4.
*  Worked out for 20 minutes, sat in the sauna for 10 and then I was on weight.
*  That's amazing.
*  It was the easiest cut of my life.
*  That's amazing.
*  You just got it dialed in perfectly.
*  My body is...
*  I've been doing this...
*  People make fun of me when I say I've been doing it since four, but my dad caught me
*  sneaking tamales into the bathroom when I was six.
*  I've been doing this my whole life.
*  My body is a machine.
*  It knows once it gets down we get to go right back up.
*  My mind internally, but it knows.
*  One of the things you said that I thought was really funny, I hope Tony breaks my nose
*  so I can get it fixed.
*  Yeah, everyone talks about how I talk.
*  For one, I talk fast.
*  I've always talked fast.
*  It sounds like I'm mumbling, but my nose doesn't work.
*  I'm like, sit there, plug your nose and talk.
*  See, this is the same thing.
*  I can tell hearing it because my nose used to be broken too.
*  I had it fixed.
*  I had the deviated septum.
*  This goes back to the dense bones.
*  I heard it in December.
*  Season ends in March.
*  I got it fixed in April.
*  It had healed already.
*  The doctor, he said I tried to drill through that side, but I couldn't get through that
*  side because your bone is too dense.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  That doctor sounds like an asshole.
*  Right?
*  That's ridiculous.
*  The college paid for it though.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  This was a long time ago.
*  This was when I was 19.
*  I split my lip too.
*  You also just have to think about the fact that you're just constantly getting hit in
*  the nose.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never got hit in the nose in a fight.
*  That's why I'm waiting.
*  But in training you do.
*  They hit my forehead.
*  They don't touch my nose or my chin.
*  Really?
*  I've seen so many people get surgery.
*  My nose doesn't bleed.
*  So Shane Cartwin, he got his surgery.
*  First bar in session back, fuck, coach, broke my nose again.
*  You're building up the cartilage.
*  And again, there's been three people through the gym that's had surgery and ended up breaking
*  their nose again.
*  I recommend it when you're done.
*  Yeah I wish they could clear it out.
*  I know about building the cartilage back up.
*  Yeah, that's what Vandeley did, which was crazy.
*  Like he became a different human.
*  But he had the worst flattened nose I've ever seen in all my years of watching combat sports.
*  Yeah, but Shane had my nose fixed.
*  He had broke my nose.
*  Like daytime I had it broken and it crawled right back.
*  But man, I could breathe good.
*  It's like, man, what happened to your nose?
*  It slowly fell back into position because it's been like that for so many years.
*  He had broke my nose in sparring.
*  I was so beat up in training.
*  Shane Cartwin?
*  Shane Cartwin.
*  I started sparring with him because he couldn't hit me.
*  Hold on.
*  Hit the brakes.
*  How much do you weigh?
*  It's wet, like 160.
*  And you're sparring with Shane fucking Cartwin?
*  Oh yeah, so my hands were so bad hitting mitts with him.
*  He hits so hard, Joe, that it's crazy.
*  So I got to understand what everybody was talking about with his gloves.
*  They were like, man, he needs different gloves.
*  And I'm like, he's got winnings, he's got the best gloves.
*  They're fine.
*  They just stop being a bitch.
*  And he hit me and broke my nose with a jab.
*  And I was just like, holy shit.
*  I'm walking him down and I came through one jab and I went to go step in and opened up
*  my guard.
*  And he hit me.
*  He's like, and I turned around.
*  I'm like, damn, man, you broke my nose.
*  And he's like, I didn't break your nose, coach.
*  And I was like, I turned back.
*  I was leaning over to the side.
*  I looked back at him like this and he's like, oh shit, coach, your nose is broke.
*  Yeah, but it.
*  I like how you meet all your fighters.
*  You gave them the worst impressions ever.
*  I did the best.
*  I had fun with them.
*  They all talk like this.
*  They almost do.
*  So I used to call them Negative Nancy, Kerrigan Carwin, Change-izer Kerrigan Carwin.
*  I like to have fun with the guys and entertain myself with them, especially with a big dude
*  like him.
*  I was like the little dog barking all the time.
*  In between fights, people don't know how big he got.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  He hit so hard.
*  Like I couldn't take the shots no more.
*  I was like, oh my hands and my arms.
*  I was like, dude, we have to work.
*  You have to get time in.
*  And I could still help him sparring.
*  Well I remember when his nose was broken when he fought Gonzaga and then he hit Gonzaga
*  with that six inch punch.
*  Crazy.
*  Just like falling backwards.
*  Just hits him with his little boom.
*  Just barely touched him.
*  Boom.
*  And Gonzaga's just fall body just shuts off.
*  It's crazy.
*  No, he was an enormous guy.
*  Oh yeah, that's broken.
*  And look, he's laughing.
*  Crazy dude.
*  He's a fun guy though.
*  I tell you, there was one time in a fight where he was on top of the guy and he was
*  dropping these shots on him.
*  And he hit him one time and the way the guy's body moved, it looked really weird.
*  I was like, I thought he just killed him.
*  He hit him so weird.
*  The way the guy's body bent and went numb.
*  I was like, oh my God, you could feel it underneath the echo underneath when he was hitting the
*  dude and his head is pinned against the canvas.
*  He is a unique dude.
*  That dude hits so freaking hard.
*  I remember his stoppage at Frank Mir.
*  That was one of the most ferocious stoppages I've ever seen in the history of the heavyweight
*  division when he's hitting him with those fucking upper cuts.
*  So I had a collar tie.
*  So in that fight, he had so many situations.
*  He was drinking a beer night.
*  He had a stem cell thing going on in his neck that he didn't know if he was going to be
*  able to fight.
*  He took it on like three weeks notice because the Brock Lesnar fell out.
*  Ended up injuring his hand.
*  So if you notice, everything was left handed.
*  He was like 30 boxing him and I had to ask for him to bump and he bumped the shoulder
*  and then went boom, boom, hit him with like three upper cuts and he folded.
*  Yeah.
*  Then he turned him on his back and was just clubbing him with the left hand.
*  And he was so injured going into that fight.
*  It was crazy the way he was able to perform.
*  Really?
*  And then when he went on a strict diet, he's like, oh, beating damn rabbit food coach.
*  And he got all fed and he was eating this great diet.
*  Mentally, he wasn't there like when we fought Dos Santos.
*  Dos Santos.
*  And again, that was a tough fight because after the Brock Lesnar fight, every question
*  was about his conditioning.
*  Shane Carwin, if he goes out there and fights the first round, like there's your fight,
*  one round fight, we're stopping the fight after the first round.
*  I don't think anybody gave it to him the first round with him.
*  But when he pulled back and he started going, hey, I need to see if I can go five rounds.
*  Oh man.
*  Because when we're Brock and he gassed out.
*  I remember with them all, we're sitting there screaming.
*  We're screaming at the top of the lungs.
*  We're like counting to three and then screaming because the crowd was so loud.
*  He couldn't hear us and he's on top of them just pounding Brock out.
*  And we were like, you need to stand back up.
*  We wanted to get back up because the ref was just letting it go, letting it go.
*  And if he stood him back up, he's going to drop him again and fights over.
*  And he gassed himself out.
*  In the second round, he's like, coach, I can't feel my legs.
*  I can't get up.
*  And I'm like, you have to fake this shit and get up.
*  And I figured once he gets out there and gets hit one time, Silverback's going to come back
*  out.
*  But he went out there.
*  I remember when he got taken down by Brock, he held onto the chin as he went down.
*  That's how tired he was.
*  He grabbed the chin and just kind of laid back.
*  But he's a unique human being.
*  He came that close.
*  That close.
*  That close to stop it.
*  But he was always so damn freaking hurt.
*  He hurt him so bad standing.
*  So bad, yeah.
*  And then when he got to the ground, Brock was just able to cover up.
*  And then he blew his wad just trying to take him out of there.
*  Yep.
*  He thought the ref was going to stop it.
*  I did too.
*  Yeah, I think everybody in the crowd, the whole energy.
*  But I was like, yeah, we were like excited, excited, excited.
*  They were like, oh my God, he's got to pull back.
*  You see like the Dominic Cruz, Henry Cejudo fight, which kind of controversial stoppage.
*  Dominic's trying to get back up and the referee stops the fight versus that fight where you're
*  seeing all these unanswered blows.
*  It's so subjective.
*  I would honestly much rather a fight be stopped early than for it to let it go on.
*  I agree.
*  Because the toughest job out there is the referees.
*  I tell you, a lot of times it's hard.
*  They got to perform too.
*  They go out there, they stop a fight too late.
*  And then they're like, next time they're like, oh man, I got to stop the fight early.
*  It's tough.
*  You're out there.
*  Like referees got such a tough job.
*  They do.
*  But sometimes.
*  But it's got to be safety.
*  You letting people go on there sometimes where I'm just like, never let that guy ref again.
*  Like taking years off a fighter.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Some guys give guys too many opportunities.
*  I thought it was Herb Dean in your fight, right?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that was the perfect stoppage.
*  Me too.
*  It was the perfect.
*  And it's rare that you say that with a guy who's still standing and moving back the way
*  Tony was in a world championship fight.
*  He never went down once.
*  Never went down once.
*  Crazy.
*  But it was getting to a point where the shift was just happening and his body was telling
*  him he was really, really outbalanced.
*  His legs were starting to go a little bit.
*  He was going to be a sand duck.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  That was not good.
*  No.
*  I don't ever want to take that beating.
*  He would have stopped it before that happened.
*  For sure.
*  I already know that.
*  Trevor would have stopped it.
*  Yeah.
*  It was you?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody could stop it in Tony's corner.
*  That's the other thing is Tony's kind of, I mean, he has a jujitsu coach, he has a striking
*  coach, but Tony marched to the beat of his own drummer.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he's got a whole disco band going on in his head.
*  He does whatever he wants.
*  It rose against Carlos Barza.
*  I take 100% credit in there because we never talked to the head coach was.
*  It was just so chaotic.
*  I mean, she threw so many damn kicks.
*  She looked so damn good, but there was no control in the damn corner.
*  I was so pissed at myself.
*  That was one of the hardest fights.
*  That's when I let the gym go and said, hey, man, I need to do this and do it with passion
*  and really take this serious because I was so bothered by that.
*  I almost was a cheerleader prior to that fight, watching her on the Ultimate Fighter perform
*  with no coaches and her just do her thing like she's so damn talented.
*  She finished everybody on the Ultimate Fighter.
*  And then she came in for that title fight and I was so upset with myself that I didn't
*  have the conversation.
*  I asked the coaches, who's that corner?
*  Who's the one calling the shots?
*  I was so upset.
*  And that kind of situation, it's very easy for teams.
*  If you look at Tony's corner, everybody in that corner is great.
*  And again, sometimes that conversation just needs to happen and saying, hey, who's going
*  to come in the corner and win?
*  Who's going to say what?
*  There's got to be someone that takes control of a corner.
*  And that's why I use less coaches now.
*  He's got his brother in there because I feel like, again, a lot of people have great things
*  to say, but we have to stick to some.
*  I remember working a corner with a wrestling coach and I'm working on clinch stuff and
*  he's working on wrestling and taking them down.
*  And I'm like, we're contradicting what we're saying right now.
*  Like who's talking?
*  Everyone's got to be able to say, shut up.
*  I'm going to warm voice at a time.
*  And you have to have that.
*  You have to have that.
*  You have to have those conversations.
*  So when the Nate Marquardt situation happened, and for people who don't know what happened,
*  Nate was on T. There was a time in the UFC in combat sports where you were allowed to
*  take TRT.
*  Testosterone replacement therapy.
*  And we always talk about TRT Vitor because he was the best example of what could happen
*  when you take an older fighter and you juice him to the gills and then throw him out there.
*  He was like a fucking alien.
*  That guy had muscles on his teeth.
*  The times when Vitor was his scariest, the Luke Rockhole fight, the Bisping fight, the
*  Henderson fight.
*  Dude, Vitor was fucking terrifying.
*  But it was weird that you're letting this guy take testosterone.
*  And Nate was, they tested him and they found that his levels were off the charts.
*  And they were like, what are you doing?
*  You can't fight.
*  He got suspended and then all of a sudden he had a fight again.
*  And they took him off suspension, which is crazy to me.
*  And then he uses his doctor again with the TRT.
*  And I'll tell you one thing, Nate is one of the, again, being coachable, he's one of the
*  most coachable guys.
*  Sometimes almost over-coachable because if, I remember he'd walk around and say, this
*  is the best boxing coach in the world.
*  It doesn't matter who he was, he's the best boxing coach.
*  John Chambers, best conditioning coach.
*  He just believed what you were saying.
*  He's just so trustworthy.
*  And his doctor, he believed in so freaking much to go, how much?
*  This doctor, we couldn't even get ahold of the week of that fight.
*  He wouldn't answer his phone.
*  He's like, I'm at a lacrosse game and I'm just like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Like, how do you test the levels?
*  How do you know how much you're freaking taking?
*  But this was allowed.
*  That's a big fucking issue.
*  Yeah.
*  From what I understand, the doctor gave him way more than he was supposed to get.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, you know, and again, that's a shitty fucking thing.
*  I couldn't believe how much he went down.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, a lot of these doctors, especially TRT doctors, you know, they're in those days,
*  you know, they probably wanted to prove the effectiveness of TRT.
*  They're like, well, more is better.
*  Fucking fill them up, turn them into a fucking silverback.
*  Let's go.
*  And then again, you're not told what to take, how much is it?
*  And when you see those guys get off of everything and their bodies deflate, like Vitor when
*  he fought Chris Weidman was like, Jesus Christ, this is weird to see.
*  And it becomes a mental thing too, because you need that.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Again, you have it.
*  And when you can't do it, it's such a mental thing.
*  Again, that's when you can stay strong mentally.
*  That's why I love this guy.
*  This guy is so fucking strong mentally that again, he doesn't need anything fucking else.
*  And it's the guys like that.
*  Again, Shane Carlin's best performance.
*  He had a beer at night and he was eating nachos going on.
*  He knew if I'm going to fucking fight because that brain stem thing, he's eating nachos
*  and I'm sitting here going fucking crazy motherfucker.
*  And one of his best performances mentally because he was okay.
*  This guy worked as an engineer, would drive an hour to the gym at nighttime, train at
*  nighttime, drive all the way back home, grab like a cheeseburger on the way home because
*  he ain't got time to get anything else.
*  Just crazy.
*  That is nuts that he was working full time.
*  It's crazy.
*  While he was one of the best heavyweights on the planet.
*  On the Ultimate Fighter.
*  When he coached the Ultimate Fighter, he was working in between workouts.
*  He was doing full work for his engineer job.
*  Crazy.
*  Just crazy.
*  While he was coaching the Ultimate Fighter?
*  That's insane.
*  I went to ask him a quiz job, he's going to pay him more.
*  He's like, no.
*  He's like, I already got out of the NFL because of an injury and I know I could get injured
*  at any point.
*  He's like, no.
*  Smart dude.
*  Well, he had a fucked up back, right?
*  From football?
*  Yep.
*  How bad was it?
*  Very bad.
*  I mean, he got to pre-train for pre-season and then he never went through.
*  And then he started fighting because he had fun when he went to a Ron Waterman fight.
*  Was friends with Ron Waterman.
*  He jumped in because they needed him.
*  It's crazy that it's okay for fighting, but it wasn't okay for football.
*  No, his back in the Frank Beer fight, his back was so messed up.
*  In the Roy Nelson fight, he had to pull out because of his back.
*  His back was always an issue.
*  He wound up getting surgery on it, right?
*  I'm not too sure.
*  I'm not too sure.
*  A lot of outside stuff too.
*  So after the Nate Marquardt situation, you just started up your own gym?
*  Is that what happened?
*  So all the fighters left.
*  Why did they leave?
*  They had a manager come in and I had a dispute with the managers and they started managing
*  all the guys.
*  They wanted to be a part of grudge and I didn't want to settle for what they were talking
*  about.
*  They started training in a different gym and me and Nate didn't see eye to eye on it because
*  the way their publicist put something out so I don't do interviews no more.
*  I was like, oh, you put my words the wrong way.
*  Me and Nate talked it out and became friends again.
*  I was like, I had your back.
*  That gray area pissed me off.
*  I had to speak about it.
*  The way that whole situation was handled, Nate left, everybody left.
*  I was like, cool.
*  I started with him brand new.
*  I had him, I had Rose.
*  The gray area meaning the TRT where I was pissed.
*  I was like, you guys are going to cut him out and shun him like this and say that he's
*  doing this when you allowed him to take TRT but there's no way you can tell how much he's
*  taking.
*  It's crazy to me.
*  They can only tell the levels that you have.
*  But you said it's okay.
*  And then you took him off a suspension for this and then said, all right, cool.
*  He's like, I'm going to bring things back to normal.
*  He's like, oh, doctor, I got to fight.
*  It's just crazy to me.
*  Like they said, all right, we'll test it after this fight.
*  I'm like, dude, it's just crazy.
*  It's the way things again, that was a very bothersome time for me.
*  But when the whole team left, because Nate left, because we didn't see eye to eye, he
*  was pissed at what I said.
*  I was standing up for him.
*  I was like, all right, whatever.
*  See the way you want to see it.
*  And I've always been about my guys, fighter first.
*  And the whole team left.
*  So I was like, once that happened, I was like, man, am I going to go work at Home Depot?
*  What am I going to do?
*  But I just got a new fucking gym, big ass gym.
*  He was brand new with me.
*  Rose was brand new.
*  I was like, I'll start over.
*  This is wow.
*  And I came in, I came in through the other manager.
*  And I only did a year for two years when I was like, fine, fucking leaving Trevor.
*  You guys are stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this motherfucker is a genius.
*  What are you thinking?
*  And then thank God they left.
*  Yeah, now I got into myself.
*  Fuck them.
*  After my lease was up, I let the gym go and started an equipment company and started focusing
*  on how can I because I respect every fighter who fights.
*  I have so much respect for you getting in there.
*  And as I get older, I get a little softer side to me.
*  It's like when I even when we win, I see the other person loose.
*  Like it's hard for me to celebrate.
*  Seeing them down is a hard thing.
*  Like cowboy, that was a hard fight for me.
*  Like I didn't think it would be hard at all.
*  Looking across the cage wasn't hard at all.
*  You know, he's a he's a gangster and I know we'd still be cool.
*  But when the ref wasn't stopping the fight when he's hitting with the uppercuts, like
*  I jumped up on the canvas, could have caused the disqualification because there's still
*  no real set rule on how do I stop a fucking fight.
*  Right.
*  It happened in New Mexico.
*  You can't stop my opponent's fight.
*  But I jumped up like stop the fucking fight.
*  And then I ended up walking back with cowboy all the way to the back.
*  It made me emotional.
*  It's hard.
*  Like here we're stopping him.
*  He's on his next title run and we're stopping him in his tracks, stopping him moving forward.
*  And he's moving forward.
*  Yes, it's my fighter.
*  I want him to move forward and all those things.
*  But with age, it's been harder for me.
*  And again, I respect every person who's out there inspires people.
*  So I started sewing in the gym and then I moved into my basement and I was like, you
*  know what?
*  I want to start something new.
*  I want to be able to help every athlete out there that goes out there and risk their life.
*  So I started making equipment.
*  And with my injuries, I just couldn't coach.
*  That's why Shane broke his knees.
*  Big guys anymore.
*  My body was so fucked up all the time.
*  What kind of injuries do you have?
*  I've had all sorts of injuries, dude.
*  It's like in there.
*  Elbows, elbows and wrists.
*  And like when you're drinking a beer with a straw, you're at the bar and you're drinking
*  it up because you got the mashed potato head.
*  What is good for your wrist is that fucked up?
*  I do.
*  My hands are so bad.
*  So look at my how my hand opens.
*  Mm hmm.
*  It's not a cop.
*  It's not dent dented from taking punches.
*  I just believe it's from me trying to squeeze on the mitts because I got small hands and
*  you got no left or right when it comes to a minute and I'm holding mitts on trying not
*  to let them fly across the room.
*  I think it just created my ligaments in my my hand to shape that way.
*  Well, isn't that crazy?
*  But my forearms are so flat now.
*  Not at all.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  So I'd go in the hot tub and push my fingers and try to separate them and it'd be like
*  the most painful thing ever.
*  But elbow issues and inside of my forearms.
*  People don't realize how hard it is holding mitts, especially for big guys.
*  Body punches like my chest bone clicks now because of him.
*  You got to I just can't take chest shots.
*  But I started making equipment because I needed it.
*  I was like I needed to make shit out there because you don't.
*  I had had sponsorships by companies.
*  They send me mitts and they're like give us some feedback and I'll be like the colors
*  are cool.
*  I would cut them open and re foam them.
*  And I've been doing this for 15 years.
*  We foaming with I'd go find different foams because I needed something soft take the shock
*  off but you need something a little bit dense to keep the bone from bone and you do the
*  whole deal right with sewing machines.
*  I took my mom's sewing machine.
*  I said can I borrow your sewing machine?
*  And I tried to make a mitt that had a left and a right that I wouldn't have to squeeze
*  my hands to hold on to because my hands are so weak.
*  And after two sessions I was like dude I can't even hold the mitts.
*  Wow.
*  I couldn't even hold on to the tiepads.
*  It's freaking crazy.
*  I started by need and then I'd be at fights and all these high level coaches are like
*  where'd you get that?
*  I'm like I made that one.
*  I remember the first pair of mitts I made they're so ugly.
*  I went to Joann Fabrics and got some materials and made these mitts and every coach in my
*  gym was like dude I want a pair and I was like cool pay for the materials I'll make
*  you some.
*  And man all of a sudden I'm like a year out from these custom stuff and I'm an artist
*  at heart so once I started learning how to sew then I'm starting to learn materials and
*  it just went crazy from an equipment coaching standpoint.
*  Then I was like you know what I need to release something for the fighters and the hand issues
*  and the training issues that I was always dealing with almost all the time my fighters
*  were going into fights they were injured.
*  They were going into fights injured and that's common.
*  Like you can talk to anybody they're going into fights injured and they have to because
*  they're not going to get paid if they're not fighting.
*  And they're like instantly I could name a guy whose head's how many surgeries and he
*  continues to fight like with bad injuries and he's like well I'll get a surgery afterwards
*  and he's fighting off adrenaline but how many times like the Shane Carlin fight going into
*  it injured able to perform and I was a psychologist and once I started doing this equipment it
*  clicked everybody's like yeah we need better stuff we need stuff that's made for MMA we
*  need MMA equipment.
*  It's crazy to me you there's a picture of you back in the day where you had this headgear
*  on that was small just covered to your forehead and I'm like why are people wearing these
*  big ass headgears.
*  That's like old school when they made boxing headgears people think boxing headgear is
*  safe it is not safe you're putting heavier weight on your head that blocks your vision
*  and if you can't see a shot coming and you knock me with that with that heavier weight
*  on there you're causing way more linear damage to me.
*  Think about like when you're at that park I always think about the little springs with
*  the dinosaur on it my daughter gets on it's like we're just bouncing back and forth but
*  if I get on it I like hang down.
*  Remember how Mike Tyson used to wear that real thin headgear?
*  Yeah totally totally just to prevent cuts.
*  It's all we eat I wear it a month out.
*  Like MMA is not the norm to have headgear on it's not because you grapple you do all
*  these different things so you get the clip in the way you can't do any type of grappling
*  with it so I'm on a mission to create all this new stuff again just evolve and it's
*  never going to be better but each time get a little better a little better a little better.
*  The UFC glove the one that Rashaad brought on the glove is the same in the UFC it's still
*  the guano pattern.
*  Remember the guano glove the only thing they did different is the skirt they used to have
*  a skirt it was a pain in the ass to get on.
*  Shane Carlin I remember we had to cut into his gloves one time and that's why that was
*  changed his hand was so big that they had to change the glove size because Brock was a
*  4x then we had to make a 5x but they actually opened up the skirt because of that because
*  Shane Carlin we actually allowed the commission allowed us to cut it open but when it comes
*  to to the glove I can't even say it's the worst glove it's really the only glove they
*  did have the pride gloves that were really good.
*  They were better.
*  They were better.
*  It's the worst part of the of the night for me when I fight is putting those gloves on
*  you're you start getting a burning in your forearms just to make a fist you're constantly
*  fighting against yourself just to make a fist it's constantly pulling you open.
*  The natural thing for those gloves is to keep your hand open.
*  It makes no sense it pulls you here and then to make it you literally have to strain
*  the whole time with your forearms on.
*  Everyone complains.
*  Put this on your left.
*  Could you mind if I run around to the side of the table?
*  No no no go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  That's uh yeah that's one of the ones I think I knocked out.
*  So this is.
*  I got cowboy with that one.
*  So this is the UFC glove.
*  Yep.
*  So that's the UFC glove.
*  Right.
*  Can you take off your watch so I can get it because the strap is key.
*  Yeah sure.
*  And so yours are the other ones the white ones are yours?
*  Yes these are mine so let's put that on so I can kind of explain.
*  Okay.
*  We're gonna explain.
*  Explain it to the microphone.
*  So this is what happens with fighters and anybody who's worn fought with gloves like this.
*  They put this on they get the strap on and they also have a hand wrap underneath this.
*  So what happens is when you go to make a when you go to make a fist.
*  Go ahead and make a fist.
*  Notice that it's hard to do this and when you do this you start getting a lot of pressure in
*  between your fingers here and that's a huge thing that fighters feel.
*  What's his name Robin Rowe actually has a he's one of the cut men.
*  He has a wood tool that's end of a hammer that stretches these out because the pressure puts
*  right here.
*  Okay it's also hard to it's also hard to make a grip so when you go to make a grip here
*  it's tough because it's a gardening glove it's got all these straight finger pieces here so
*  you're packing all this material here and then as you squeeze it it's hard.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard to constantly you have to use your forearms.
*  At the end of the fight that's what everybody talks about.
*  It's this.
*  I haven't had the experience.
*  Turning over your punches is where it really gets you.
*  So when you put this on I'm going to kind of explain this.
*  Is this the right hand?
*  So I actually made space back here for the hand wrap.
*  Now there's a strapping system that goes down inside this so when I pull on this
*  you'll notice this piece right here actually pulls on this.
*  There's no fingers so it's easy to grab onto.
*  There's space for the hand wrap but this strap is actually connected here with a seat belt
*  type of material that pulls on the back of the metacarpal so when I pull on this
*  you'll actually feel it lock up on the back of your hand.
*  Oh this is way better.
*  And then when you wrap like this there is no grabbing of the glove so you're not going to
*  be able to grab like with the velcro.
*  It puts you in such a comfortable hand but like a normal position.
*  Have you brought these to the UFC?
*  I have.
*  I have been speaking.
*  You showed me these quite a while ago and I said it before and so you've improved on them.
*  This is far superior.
*  Dana loved the gloves.
*  He was blown away by them when he seen them.
*  This is way better.
*  He liked the lace up.
*  It's so much more comfortable.
*  The issue is there with a company called Diacoda.
*  That's one who makes the manufacturing products and they wanted to own the technology because all
*  of our stuff is patented.
*  I went through the patenting processes.
*  I put six years.
*  So the company that makes the UFC gloves wants to own your shit?
*  Completely.
*  They don't want to own it.
*  The UFC wants to own it.
*  Oh come on.
*  The thing is with it is again I feel like I want to bring this to all organizations but that's
*  not really the real issue.
*  The finger pokes is one thing.
*  At least you're getting paid to do what you do.
*  But just this right here where it's not forcing your hand open.
*  This grip is so comfortable.
*  I feel comfortable.
*  So notice the spot on the side too.
*  Oh yeah protected.
*  You remember when Ronda fought Sarah McMahon.
*  She actually cut her knuckle right here.
*  It was crazy to me underneath the hand wrap and everything but the glove sits up above
*  your hand so you don't protect that or hammer fist.
*  And again being able to shape to the...
*  That's the lead break in our sport.
*  Boxers is the fourth and fifth metacarpal and MMA is the first metacarpal.
*  Yeah.
*  Because of the distance.
*  Because of the thumb and so the first and second.
*  This is so superior.
*  It is.
*  It's a great glove.
*  But again it's the training issues that I was focused on.
*  I didn't need like when I heard they needed a glove I was like cool I could make a glove
*  for him so I made a glove.
*  That's actually how I made my wallet because I was like all right let me think through this.
*  Have you seen his wallet?
*  I cut their gloves.
*  You've seen a few times but I cut their glove up to see what foam they're using.
*  I mean there's technology foam out there and it's crazy that our sport is not using any
*  type of technology foam.
*  It's crazy.
*  But if you look at our...
*  So what is technology foam and what is this foam?
*  So it's made for contact.
*  It's made for to take contact.
*  Not like what you sit on like a pad that you sit on.
*  And that's what this is?
*  No.
*  That's EVA foam.
*  Yes it's...
*  The UFC foam is the shit you sit on.
*  So this is not designed for hitting things.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  It's not designed for hitting things.
*  Again it's up to the manufacturer to be able to...
*  But again that's not a huge thing again in the fight.
*  You want to have...
*  So much better for your hand.
*  You want to...
*  For your hand.
*  I mean this is...
*  This is...
*  I mean...
*  It's not your day.
*  So again...
*  It's not your day.
*  I don't want to talk shit about their glove.
*  They don't know what they don't know.
*  Please talk shit about their glove.
*  No the thing is the injuries in training like the training injuries drive me freaking
*  crazy because of the coach.
*  And we're not using those gloves.
*  It's all these gloves out there that you're getting for $60.
*  If you're buying a glove for $60 it's getting made for probably five, six, seven bucks.
*  Like it's crazy to me the stuff that I'm cutting open that the gloves that are say 16 ounces on
*  them that weigh 11 ounces.
*  Like I got to show you...
*  Right and left never wears the same.
*  Right's always lighter.
*  Like if anybody's out there...
*  They want you to think you're faster than their gloves.
*  I recommend you start weighing all your gloves.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  To see what they weigh.
*  It blows my mind.
*  Me being a gym owner you have to sign a waiver to come into my gym.
*  It's crazy.
*  Crazy to me that gloves don't...
*  They're cookie cutter tags.
*  Like no one's checking this.
*  There's no quality checking.
*  When you're sparring with things.
*  Well your boxing gloves are amazing too.
*  They really are excellent.
*  Oh that's crazy.
*  Okay.
*  So...
*  So that was from season 10 with the heavyweights.
*  So this is supposed to be how many ounces?
*  16.
*  It's 11 ounces.
*  Wow.
*  Not for the heavyweights to spar with.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's not good.
*  That's a professional fight glove.
*  That's not good.
*  Crazy.
*  But just the contour of these I think would take out a lot of eye pokes.
*  It would take out a lot of eye pokes.
*  The fact that your hand is like naturally pulling open on the UFC glove.
*  It sort of lends itself to these eye pokes.
*  And you get to perform better.
*  Like if your hand can stay in a better position.
*  My forearm is getting bent out of shape.
*  Plus with your gloves like this.
*  So if my glove is pulling my hand back like this.
*  It's like doing a push up on my doordocking knuckles.
*  Right.
*  I have no leverage.
*  Right.
*  Like it's going to help performance.
*  It's going to help.
*  Of course.
*  It promotes...
*  I'm more about the performance when it comes to the fight glove.
*  When it comes to the training stuff it's about getting to the fight healthy
*  and not having to pull out of a fight.
*  So explain to me the issue of getting this pass through.
*  Because this is the best glove for MMA for sure.
*  There was a few issues.
*  Have you tested it?
*  And I said, all right listen.
*  Your glove's never been tested.
*  What has it been tested with?
*  That's another issue that just boggles me.
*  That our equipment has never been tested.
*  NFL, you go to any other sport league.
*  All equipment is tested.
*  Snowboarding, skiing.
*  I think everybody looks at this stuff.
*  Especially when it comes to putting stuff on.
*  You're a fighter.
*  Oh you got to deal with head concussions.
*  You got to deal with this.
*  Football, they're playing a game.
*  How many times are they testing stuff in other sports?
*  But look at our injury rate.
*  We have 70% of injuries are happening in training.
*  Not the fight.
*  That's crazy.
*  You have no equipment on in the fight.
*  And more injuries are happening in training.
*  That blows my mind.
*  Well it's because you're training a lot more than you're fighting.
*  Yeah but again, like you think about football.
*  Like I've had someone tell me, hey but they stop hitting in practice.
*  And I'm like, yeah but you play every week.
*  So you're fighting every week.
*  So it's a whole different thing.
*  You need to be able to spar to know that you can make the right decisions in that hurricane.
*  To be able to know that you're conditioned to fight.
*  So again, you have to be able to train like that.
*  Some of the biggest injuries I've seen in training are like someone getting hit with a knee.
*  When they don't have a knee pad on.
*  They're throwing a kick, someone's shooting down.
*  They hit the knee.
*  Josh Copeland ended up getting 17 stitches in my gym.
*  Because the other guy didn't have a knee pad on.
*  Like where are the standards when it comes to training?
*  That's a huge thing too.
*  You got guys coming in and going, oh man, I've just got hand-me-down equipment.
*  It's been used for four years.
*  The foam is broken down.
*  Again, why is headgear used?
*  To stop cuts so you can get to the fight.
*  Do you make a headgear or a knee pad as well?
*  So I've been testing.
*  I've had the same.
*  So this is the headgear.
*  That's your headgear.
*  So it's no clip so you can grapple.
*  Oh.
*  Like super cool.
*  Here I'll give you one to feel the.
*  Okay so Velcro's on the top.
*  So feel the weight behind this.
*  Uh huh.
*  Oh wow, it's super light.
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  That's perfect in terms of the amount of protection too.
*  Like it's not delusional.
*  It's like it's not keeping you from.
*  It's to stop cuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Simply to stop cuts.
*  Yeah.
*  I run into an elbow.
*  I run into a hip.
*  I run into a knee.
*  I bet you can see way better with this.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no blind spots.
*  That's why I make the angles like I do on this headgear.
*  So if you look at the one with our funny looking mannequin,
*  you're going to see you lose no vision with it.
*  Yeah, no you could tell.
*  Oh that's so much better.
*  Oh that's amazing.
*  Yeah, you don't have any peripheral problems.
*  There's no blind spots.
*  That's excellent.
*  And the foam that we're using is,
*  this is what I'm talking about.
*  Technology foam.
*  Feel this.
*  Okay.
*  As opposed to what other kind of foam?
*  EVA foam is in I'd say 95% of headgear.
*  And is it just cheaper?
*  It's just cheaper.
*  Yes, it's cheaper.
*  So you're going to find carpet padding,
*  you're going to find.
*  See how it bounced the recoil?
*  So this absorbs energy.
*  This is what he's talking about.
*  So think of it.
*  That's crazy.
*  Think of water.
*  Let's explain this for people that are just listening.
*  He had this one foam, the EVA cheaper foam,
*  and Justin's dropping, what is that a ball bearing or something?
*  Yeah, some marble, big marble.
*  I got a big one but we're almost out of time.
*  And then it hits that cheap foam and it bounces like crazy.
*  But when it hits the technology foam,
*  it stops dead in its tracks because it completely absorbs the impact.
*  Think about water.
*  The faster you hit it, the more you, the more, the faster you'll stop.
*  If you go into it slow, you just kind of slide through it.
*  So that stuff you feel, it feels like NASA foam, like super, super soft.
*  It sticks to your head, doesn't move around, so it forms to your head.
*  Drop the bigger ball in there.
*  That's crazy.
*  Now drop it on one of those other ones.
*  It'll actually pinch the foam through it and cause damage to it.
*  So you think about gloves.
*  How many times are you hitting something?
*  In boxing, you're not allowed to spar with the gloves you're hitting bags with
*  because you break the foams in.
*  Right.
*  And again, it's just crazy to me.
*  There's no new technologies when it comes to these types of things.
*  Even if, I don't know what kind of pad is under where we fight,
*  but if something was there to absorb the energy when we got knocked out and our head
*  hit the back, I would assume it would be better for us.
*  Health-wise.
*  All these things.
*  So with shin guards, most people deal with the injury on the instep.
*  When the shin guard is made, you have this instep and you got the soft spot on the weakest
*  part of your foot.
*  Knee checks, it's like one of the biggest injuries.
*  So many ligaments.
*  Again, all the time your feet are like, damn, I got checked right on that spot.
*  I'm actually making gear that has a boot back behind it.
*  So that protects that spot.
*  You'll see it pop out.
*  So it's foamed back behind where you actually zip in.
*  So that's all protected on the soft spot.
*  I have not found a shin guard out there.
*  90% of shin guards aren't left or right either.
*  You kind of just get right to your body.
*  You look at the straps and say, which way do they go?
*  And another pet peeve of mine, when I'm a coach and I got a world-class athlete
*  and they're stopping every time they throw a kick to say, hey, man, let me fix my shin
*  guard.
*  It's turning.
*  Yes.
*  Drives me freaking crazy.
*  So I made shin guards.
*  It's actually going to fit, not turn on.
*  You cover your toes, actually have flex where your toe goes.
*  You can adjust the bottom.
*  It's zipping in the boot area.
*  So there's no sliding.
*  Just again, rethinking how things are made.
*  Knee pads.
*  Knee pads protecting on the side.
*  So if I go to throw a knee, I'm not going to hit you with the side.
*  These guys are using volleyball knee pad guards.
*  It just drives me crazy.
*  World-class sport.
*  World-class.
*  And nothing has changed.
*  So that's what I've been doing in my basement, having a blast doing.
*  Just creating this new shit to keep guys lasting long.
*  I'm the tester.
*  I'm serious.
*  I have not been hurt in five years in training.
*  It's super cool.
*  When I have forgot my shin guards, two times, I believe.
*  And putting other ones on, I feel so vulnerable when I'm wearing them.
*  There's no comparison.
*  And I sound biased, but top-level athletes, when they put this on, it's so unbelievable.
*  We sell out every time.
*  And elite athletes are using their stuff, which is super, super cool.
*  Try this pad on.
*  Don't say what's inside of it.
*  You might sound biased, but I think you're right.
*  I think you're telling the truth.
*  Just the quality of this shit.
*  Trevor, you sent me some of this stuff before, and I've raved about it.
*  It's excellent.
*  Did you heat it up?
*  Did you heat mold the foam?
*  No.
*  So I didn't think I explained that to you.
*  I just kind of said it about to you.
*  You put a hairdryer in there for four minutes to watch what happens, dude.
*  Fucking crazy.
*  Then you put your hand in there, and it kind of forms.
*  It has a moldable foam, our base layer.
*  So you did this because of all the problems you were having with your hands?
*  Yeah, so now I wanted something I could just hang on.
*  I feel like I can hang on something a long time like this.
*  And the handle on a tie pad is hard for me to grip with weak hands.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  And do you make these a longer form for tie?
*  For like kicking?
*  I can make everything.
*  I make everything two forms.
*  So all over the gear that we sell, we custom make two sizes.
*  So we separate the foot size because you think like Rashad Evans.
*  Rashad Evans has a fat calf.
*  And he has real short legs.
*  So he has to get the extra larges where it comes up where he can't wear knee pads
*  because the shin guards are this high.
*  And then he's got this foot pad that doesn't fit his big ass foot.
*  He's got an awkward size.
*  So we're shaping everything.
*  We actually went to the UFC.
*  We're doing 3D scans and we shape the equipment to you.
*  Super freaking cool.
*  So explain to me again why the UFC doesn't adopt this glove.
*  I spent two years there and again, Dana gets it.
*  I don't want to sell this to the UFC.
*  I would much rather give it to Dana.
*  I feel like Dana helped grow this industry what it is,
*  but they're not Zufa no more.
*  They're a different company.
*  And again, it's very hard.
*  I'm speaking like you were talking earlier.
*  I speak a language they can't understand.
*  They don't know.
*  You don't know what you don't know.
*  They don't understand the issues that I deal with.
*  When we talk about the gloves.
*  Are you talking about the owners?
*  No, I'm talking about the people who handle the deals.
*  They don't sit back in the locker rooms and deal with what goes on with the fight gloves,
*  how your arms get tired.
*  Their gloves suck.
*  They have no idea their gloves suck.
*  They have no idea.
*  Again, you don't know.
*  You don't have to know.
*  Why wouldn't they?
*  Right. They're like, well, look, we put on this fight.
*  Max Holloway and Volkanovsky, they wore the regular gloves.
*  We're fine.
*  Yeah.
*  Every single fighter has a complaint about your gloves.
*  These are so much better.
*  So they wanted to own the technology and that technology they have,
*  the internal strapping system is actually a technology that can go into any sport and is
*  used in all my equipment.
*  So I was like, dude, I can't just do that for the fight glove.
*  And again, I want this in all organizations.
*  Right.
*  But my goal is the training aspect first.
*  Again, I want to help the fighters get to the fight.
*  That's key.
*  They got to get paid.
*  And then it's secondary.
*  When you order our shin guards, they come by your shoe size, by your shin length.
*  You're going to get a video.
*  It's going to tell you how to give us your measurements.
*  You're going to get a custom fit.
*  We custom tailor it.
*  Think about Tim Means' Doron Wynn.
*  It's just crazy.
*  We did 3D scans.
*  Who was there?
*  Because I wasn't there.
*  So we have a 3D body scan.
*  Right now, we're currently scanning all UFC athletes that want to get scanned.
*  Because we want to test it with them.
*  And we're going to give them a fight kit.
*  It's going to be shin guard, head gear, seven ounce gloves.
*  I didn't bring you my seven ounce gloves to show you.
*  It's very sweet.
*  16 ounce gloves and a pair of four ounce MMA gloves.
*  So the seven ounce gloves are bad gloves?
*  Or do you use them?
*  I use those for so as MMA fighters.
*  We spar two times.
*  One day is 16 ounce glove.
*  One day is MMA sparring.
*  So we use seven ounce gloves.
*  And what is this weight?
*  Is this four?
*  That's four ounces.
*  That one's actually the same as the other one.
*  The 5.8 ounces.
*  This seems like it protects your knuckles so much better.
*  Totally.
*  I mean, it's just night and day.
*  And we go back to the four ounce gloves.
*  Again, everybody thinks every UFC glove is four ounces.
*  You're going from 5X to extra small.
*  So you're going from about 8 point something ounces all the way down to like 2.9 ounces
*  is for the flyweights.
*  Yeah, flyweights.
*  Yep.
*  This is amazing.
*  This is really good.
*  So what has to be done?
*  So this is like, so I put some pressure on somebody.
*  Well, again, when it comes to testing things, like we're testing things,
*  you got to see the testing that we're doing.
*  It's super fucking cool.
*  I've got data collectors right here.
*  Check out this hand that we got.
*  It's got sensor points on it to be able to tell the force.
*  Because they were like, why do you have it tested?
*  Fake hand.
*  Yeah, so it's a rubber hand with sensors in it to be able to test.
*  So we're testing everything because they were like, have you tested it?
*  Have you proved it?
*  I'm like, what am I testing against?
*  Like, what do you guys want me to test?
*  I guess.
*  What does that mean?
*  Testing it.
*  Listen, this is super cool.
*  Give it to a fighter, tell him to put it on.
*  Do you like it?
*  Yeah, this is better.
*  Listen to him.
*  That's the test.
*  So this is pretty cool.
*  Move to the right.
*  OK.
*  So those are x-rays with gloves on.
*  So you can kind of see how I think.
*  I know what a glove feels like on the inside.
*  Almost all boxing gloves have you in a door knocking knuckle position.
*  And there's so much floating space.
*  Wait till you see the X-factor glove in there.
*  Look at the foam.
*  It's so cool how it supports around your hands.
*  Are these your wraps?
*  Yeah, those are wraps that I actually stepped away from because
*  we put the straps inside the gloves.
*  So they say when you start to think.
*  I haven't used wraps in three years.
*  So let me talk about this real quick.
*  Even for heavy bag gloves?
*  Nothing.
*  So I would never tell anybody that back in the day because I'd be like,
*  when I was fighting, I was like.
*  These were the wraps or these are the wraps?
*  So those are wraps.
*  How I started Onyx was I started with hand wraps outside of my equipment that I was doing.
*  I was like, all right, what can I bring to market?
*  So I started a patent on hand wraps.
*  And with this patent, it came into the gloves.
*  I was like, well, fuck if I can make gloves that have support system in it.
*  Because you think about what do you need a hand wrap for?
*  And I'm not talking a professional hand wrap that you fight in.
*  I'm talking about the 120 inch wrap that gets tangled up in your laundry and
*  stinks up your gloves when you put them on.
*  This wrap that I was doing, I was able to put inside the glove.
*  And if I'm able to make a glove fit in a size so the strapping pulls the glove down
*  to shrink against your hand.
*  Pulls it up.
*  If I have a glove that's too big, I've always had small hands.
*  And when I have this extra space, I go to hit him.
*  He bobs it and weaves his head.
*  And my hand does this and tweaks because the glove is this much longer on this side.
*  I start to cause hand problems.
*  When I'm wrapping my hands, all I'm doing is adding more material in the ball of my
*  hand here.
*  So if we're grabbing onto something, the more material I have in between my hand.
*  Let me see that foam real quick.
*  Yellow foam.
*  So if I have, so when you're putting wrap on and you've got material inside your hand
*  here, Joe, I've also got the material from the glove.
*  So the more material I put inside my hand here, I stop getting my natural fist.
*  I start to get this.
*  And that causes my leverage points to start causing injuries.
*  If you have ligament injuries, it's because you don't have any flex behind.
*  So I can't pack my fist.
*  So I'm stretching my fingers.
*  If I'm not lining my strong bones up, meaning my metacarpal is down with my strong bone,
*  I'm not getting the correct alignment in my fist.
*  If I start going to my door knocking knuckles, I'm not lining my wrist up.
*  For people who are just listening to this too, Trevor has a whole series of x-rays
*  of a person's hand inside regular gloves and then inside his gloves.
*  And it shows you that with the Onyx gloves, you're getting a flat knuckle at the top.
*  So it'd be just like balling your fist with nothing in your hand and punching someone
*  with the knuckles as opposed to, like you said, hitting with that door knock, door knock.
*  We have a tiny, tiny, because again, this is not good, but
*  any kind of flex here is going to cause ligament damage.
*  So Rose would not go without wraps.
*  She would not go without wraps.
*  And then after six months of using the gloves, she's like, I'm going to try it without wraps.
*  She didn't have a fight schedule, but I always recommend, hey, man, if it gets what you,
*  again, change is hard for a lot of people.
*  I would never have done it when I was fighting.
*  Do they force you to wrap your hands in the UFC?
*  No, you're not forced to.
*  I mean, they're going to send a cut man to you.
*  Now, a professional hand wrap is different because when I get a professional hand wrap on,
*  there's a little space of material.
*  So it's like grabbing onto a finger.
*  That's great.
*  I got a little bit of grip, but when you start packing too much material,
*  like the hand wraps, 120 inches, that's where the issue is.
*  If I don't know how to wrap my hand, I'm causing more damage because I'm putting too much material.
*  Right.
*  And you're stressing out the ligaments.
*  And again, that's what's causing the damage in the hands.
*  And again, hand injuries are that's your money makers.
*  So one more time, how's, what do we have to do to get this into the UFC?
*  So does this is, I think, I think we either wait for the Diaco deal to get up
*  or we continue to do what we're doing.
*  Is Diaco the company that makes these?
*  Who's Diaco?
*  So Diaco is now making the glove for the UFC.
*  Okay.
*  It used to be Century before that.
*  Okay.
*  Century was doing it.
*  Their deal is for how long?
*  Do we know?
*  I don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  We want those in the UFC.
*  This is way better.
*  Yeah, it's way better.
*  But again, my goal, Joe, like that's the fight is not a huge issue.
*  I did that as a favor.
*  Like I was like, I could help.
*  It'd be great marketing too, right?
*  Right.
*  But my thing is helping the injuries.
*  The ones that I dealt with with the issues of people having crappy gloves.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  I understand what you're saying, but let's get to the heat of the matter here.
*  So Diaco, is that how you say the name?
*  Diaco.
*  D-Y-A-C-O.
*  So they want this technology?
*  They want to own it?
*  No.
*  To have this in the UFC?
*  UFC wants to own it.
*  UFC wants to own it.
*  But they want me to work with Diaco to be able to do it.
*  Now, if I work with Diaco, they want to put the UFC brand on it.
*  And they want me to partner with Diaco.
*  No, we're our own company.
*  Like it's not even a big...
*  Are they offering you anything to do this or they just want to just absorb it?
*  Hey, man.
*  Not even anything to what this is.
*  I'm going to change this whole freaking game when it comes to something.
*  Now, if someone like a Nike comes to me and says, hey, man, let's partner.
*  Let's do something.
*  That's a different thing.
*  Now I got access to great manufacturing.
*  Our issues right now is we keep selling out because I'm dealing with a manufacturer
*  that makes snowboard boots because they have the best strapping system.
*  They have the best materials because it's waterproof.
*  Doesn't take on water.
*  Doesn't start to get the bacterias.
*  I've used so many different manufacturing companies that make gloves already
*  and they can't make what I make because they're stuck in their old patterns.
*  They're always making gloves that way.
*  I've tried so many.
*  So we make them out of house.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So this is a problem.
*  So when the UFC...
*  No, that's the solution.
*  This is the solution.
*  But this is a problem.
*  This is not in the UFC.
*  It will be.
*  There's no doubt in my mind.
*  It's again, it's one of those things.
*  But the UFC wants to own this patent.
*  Yeah, they want to own it.
*  Like I said, I want to work with Dana.
*  Dana wants that glove.
*  And so Dana knows about this.
*  He's put it on.
*  100%.
*  Oh, he's tried it on.
*  Yeah, well, me and him had one of the best conversations ever.
*  He's like, man, this is the best thing ever.
*  It's the best glove.
*  Yeah, it was one of the best things.
*  It's hard for people to listen to this and try to put it in their head
*  because half the people are watching, half the people are listening.
*  But for the people listening, I mean, if you're a martial artist
*  and you need to get some MMA gloves, this is by far the best glove I've ever put on my hand.
*  You know what needs to happen in the NFL.
*  What needs to happen?
*  In the NFL, when you're training, you're using high level equipment
*  and it's provided by the NFL.
*  That's your athletes.
*  Right.
*  So the UFC needs to provide it.
*  This needs to be, they need to be wearing equipment that's going to protect them,
*  help them get to the fight and when they're in the fight, be able to perform.
*  Yeah.
*  And not deal with what I've been dealing my whole life as being a psychologist,
*  to get people to the fight and worrying about these issues of them fading out
*  and being like thinking about your hand.
*  I had tied my boxing boot too tight one time.
*  I had these high Adidas, you know, those real tall ones back in the day,
*  herns used to wear and I tied them too tight on my calf.
*  And I remember all I could think about was my calf muscle.
*  I was like, oh my God, it was such a distraction when I was fighting.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Tied your shoestring too tight.
*  This is what they deal with all the time with their hands.
*  First thing they're doing, like get my glove off, get my gloves off.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's too tight, cuts the circulation off.
*  It's not, your hands can't breathe, man.
*  It's so, it's such an uncomfortable feeling.
*  This is night and day.
*  And that's made for a hand wrap.
*  Like that one is made for a hand wrap.
*  Our fight was made for the hand wrap.
*  All this is cause more pressure when you add a little bit, anything under there.
*  Yeah.
*  So now I got a glove up and get a bigger size glove than I would originally have.
*  The padding in this thing is so superior too.
*  Like when you punch.
*  Well, it's the difference in the phone.
*  The shape's here.
*  It's, if you pound on the table.
*  Feel the knuckles.
*  There's, I actually make pocket holes for the knuckle where the padding would be on a hand wrap.
*  No, it slides in perfect.
*  I feel it.
*  It's amazing.
*  And again, protecting these areas too.
*  Because the number one break in MMA is that the number two metacarpal.
*  This drives me crazy when there's some roadblock for using the best thing.
*  I love it, dude.
*  I love to say when I would.
*  So that's what always made me unique is people like my dad told me in the boxing world.
*  He's like, you're going to be a boxing coach.
*  You're too damn nice.
*  And I was like, all right, cool.
*  I went out there and smiled.
*  I was like thumbs up to everybody, to my opponents.
*  I was like, Hey man, they're like, what the fuck is this guy smiling at?
*  It's actually what kind of built my name.
*  I love that.
*  Give me an obstacle and I'm going to show you that.
*  I tell him all the time.
*  Picasso would paint a picture and tell people what he's painting, but people could not see it.
*  That's what I was saying earlier.
*  I don't know what the hell he's telling me.
*  What it looked like before it came out.
*  He's seen it in here and I see it.
*  Like I see all the white space that's open.
*  Now it's about leverage and also right partners, right?
*  Finding the right people who want to get behind something that is so freaking important
*  that is overlooked.
*  It's such a huge market.
*  Yeah, it's such a huge market.
*  Everything gets attributed to boxing, but boxing is not the,
*  they're probably the main consumer, but they're not the only consumer.
*  MMA is so big.
*  It's getting so much traction.
*  That's the funny thing.
*  Boxing, boxing equipment market.
*  Everything's boxing equipment market.
*  I said, no, it's all the MMA guys buying the boxing gloves.
*  If you look up MMA gloves, you're buying boxing gloves.
*  You're buying those.
*  MMA shin guards.
*  There's not much.
*  You're buying kickboxing shin guards.
*  Yeah.
*  There's nothing.
*  There's no MMA equipment.
*  And we are specifically MMA equipment.
*  When I grapple with this, it's similar to a headgear.
*  I wrestled with a headgear my whole life.
*  It's not comfortable.
*  Headgear was never comfortable, but it's protecting me from cuts.
*  And I can still do what I need to do.
*  Trevor, you make anything for just jiu-jitsu?
*  I can make anything, dude.
*  Literally.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  Whatever you want.
*  We're keeping it simple and we're actually releasing our shin guards and headgears.
*  People have been waiting for a while because I made some for,
*  that's how I started making a headgear was TJ got cut.
*  Dwayne called me and said, hey, man, do we get for a fight?
*  He broke his nose.
*  No, that was Corey Sandhagen where I made that sweet ass headgear.
*  You know the basketball players that wear the little.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  One of those odd.
*  You got bifocals?
*  I never knew you had bifocals.
*  He stitched one into a headgear.
*  Really?
*  It was freaking crazy.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  Is that the play first?
*  Yeah, Sandhagen broke his nose.
*  I was talking about the T.T.
*  He wanted to fight still.
*  And so we're like, well, we got you.
*  And how long did he wear that in training for?
*  The whole training camp.
*  He just fought, broke his nose.
*  And then I was in there and he had another fight scheduled.
*  Such a talented dude.
*  Corey is such a good dude.
*  Very talented.
*  But he was in there with the plastic piece and I was making headgears at the point.
*  And I was like, dude, let me take that and see what I could do with it.
*  And I came back and he's like, what the fuck?
*  This is awesome.
*  But TJ, the headgear started with TJ because he went into small headgear.
*  He can still grapple with.
*  There's super court.
*  There's I like how it's open for the eyes as well.
*  So you can see out of it clearly.
*  Doesn't get fogged up or sweat it out.
*  I told TJ I'd never show anybody those pictures of me sizing him.
*  But look at the cut on his eye.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And then slide to the side.
*  You should be able to see a picture of the headgear.
*  Yeah, interesting.
*  And see how small it is and see how it fits.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah.
*  That's genius shit, man.
*  For me, the shin guards.
*  Shin guards are his best thing he's ever made.
*  What about heavy bags and stuff?
*  Oh, dude, I got a heavy bag that's so freaking sweet.
*  Dana bought two of them.
*  Yeah.
*  He bought two of them.
*  He was blown away.
*  He came down to the shop.
*  So then he brought the whole crew down.
*  Like, again, this is something that's super special.
*  Everybody sees it.
*  Everybody gets it.
*  And again, I'm not.
*  What's the difference in your heavy bag?
*  You can hit it.
*  Bare handed.
*  Bare handed.
*  And it's heavy.
*  Knuckles just sink and it doesn't hurt one bit.
*  It doesn't scratch you.
*  It doesn't.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he's got some weird beads in there.
*  And some weird.
*  The way he stitched it, they don't pack.
*  It's weird.
*  So old tie bags used to have rice.
*  OK.
*  Rice is really fun to hit, but it packs because it's got that little that little angle to it.
*  So if you keep kicking, you'll chop and you'll get a dent mark.
*  And it's so hard to work back.
*  It's very similar to that.
*  Like, it's got tons of weight to it, but you're going to hit bare knuckle
*  and not hurt your hands at all.
*  And even with my mashed potato hand, it's one of those things.
*  You got to be able to get it again.
*  You're hurting yourself.
*  Like, how many bags have you kicked and kicked a hard spot?
*  I've had bags fall apart and there's lingerie falling out.
*  Scraps of lingerie.
*  Pink lingerie out of one of my bags.
*  There's stuff in it with scraps.
*  Again, where's the technology?
*  They got that new bag out, which is cool.
*  It's a water bag.
*  But do you notice what it is?
*  You know, the ball that I'm talking about?
*  You know what that is?
*  It's a buoy.
*  It's a buoy.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  It's one of those floating buoys.
*  That's like, I always say if you got duct tape and a yellow pages,
*  you could make a good body shield.
*  Like, you put some handles on there.
*  Yeah.
*  People get real creative in the combat sports.
*  Where is the technology?
*  Where is the testing?
*  And that's what we're doing.
*  Are you selling that heavy bag as well?
*  Or is this something you're developing right now?
*  I'm focused on the training gear right now because, again,
*  manufacturing is the issue because we keep selling out.
*  Like, our gloves are sold out every time.
*  Every freaking time.
*  I can't even get them here.
*  And then I'm like, fuck, dude.
*  Because it's such a difficult process to make that they can't make a lot of them?
*  Dude, they're selling.
*  They're selling.
*  They just can't keep up with the demand.
*  I can't keep up with the demand.
*  I went back to use my other manufacturer.
*  Now we're working on building manufacturing in the United States.
*  We're actually doing all the shin guards and head gears in the States.
*  There's such a difference between these two.
*  It's kind of hilarious.
*  It's like everything about it.
*  Also, I never liked this side stitching shit, the way these fingers are done.
*  This is so much better where there's no fingers.
*  Nothing's exposed.
*  You're not going to get any scratches.
*  There's also no consistency in those UFC gloves.
*  You could pull 10 out of a bag and they all got different malfunctions.
*  The padding was like way up here.
*  And I was like, bro, look at your padding.
*  It wasn't sunk in all the way and it was just cut wrong.
*  Just made cheaply.
*  That's unfortunate.
*  It's really unfortunate when you're dealing with the very best fighters on the planet Earth
*  and they're forced to fight with inferior gear.
*  What a unique sport, right?
*  Professional fighters training with your common everyday people in the same gym.
*  You're never going to see that in sports.
*  It's crazy, right?
*  It's weird in that fact that a guy can join an MMA gym and a month later wind up sparring you.
*  I could start coaching and be 0 and 10 as a fighter and be like,
*  all right, cool, you're fighting in two weeks.
*  Professional.
*  I could make you a professional fighter in two weeks.
*  I can actually decide to go tomorrow for a fight if you want.
*  That is crazy.
*  That is crazy.
*  Yeah, there's no real.
*  That's why everyone's at MMA fashion because there's zero qualifications.
*  I want to help grow this industry and just again, create some type of standard.
*  And again, keep it safe, man, and keep it fun and keep the entertainment value high through performance.
*  If people want this stuff, what's the website address?
*  Onxsports, onxsports.com.
*  Onxsports.
*  Onyx Sports.
*  It's cool, Onyx.
*  You see the one on one.
*  The one on one.
*  There's your website.
*  The N is the one on one because I believe you fight yourself.
*  That's what the one on one means.
*  The Y is not in the Onyx because we protect your Y.
*  That Y is internal so it's all very purposeful.
*  The best thing is when I wrap people's heads at fights and they start going,
*  they start throwing their hands, it's a feeling.
*  When you know that you got good shit on, I'm telling you, feeling is everything.
*  We custom prey on every single piece of equipment.
*  We put everybody's names in the gym.
*  Put whatever you want.
*  I put the highlight or Gachey.
*  Push other people's things.
*  Again, without the coaches, without everybody else out there,
*  this industry would be nothing, man.
*  It's super cool.
*  That's very cool.
*  Fun stuff, huh?
*  Yeah, it is fun stuff but I love how much you put so much thought into this.
*  I break it, dude.
*  I live at that place.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  I'm so fucking passionate.
*  He does not stop.
*  Can't stop, won't stop.
*  I'm like, what can I help with?
*  He's like, get out of here.
*  Leave me alone.
*  I'm like, all right.
*  Especially when I'm prototyping.
*  When I got a new idea, I'm like, oh hell yeah, I got it.
*  All this is done in your basement.
*  Dude, I got glasses.
*  Now it's in my office.
*  I got these glasses.
*  I got the tape in the middle.
*  I got a pocket protector.
*  We're moving up.
*  I'm wearing a white coat.
*  We're moving up.
*  We got an office now.
*  Shoot, Saturday I fought.
*  Sunday we flew in.
*  Monday I was in the office.
*  That's my job.
*  Look at him there.
*  Look at that face.
*  He's so intense.
*  He's a perfectionist.
*  That's what kills me.
*  He'll make a headgear.
*  It's perfect.
*  He don't like it.
*  He has to start over.
*  It's like, holy shit, dude.
*  I'll never be perfect but I'm always perfecting.
*  That's how I think about things.
*  Things can always be better.
*  Someone's got to come along and make the very best gear.
*  You know the last technology that's come out in combat sports is Muhammad Ali used to be able
*  to do this after fights, which is dumb.
*  And they attached the dumb.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, that is the last.
*  It's crazy, right?
*  Well, they used to have horse hair in them too.
*  It's crazy.
*  Horse hair is cool though because that's for the fight.
*  It's like packs a punch.
*  It protects your knuckles and it gives you a good feeling in the hit.
*  See, in a fight glove, I still think it's about the fight but if we can help with finger pokes
*  and bring it back down 10%, that's a cool thing.
*  I don't think it can be eliminated because it's natural human instinct.
*  If your fingers are exposed, someone's going to get a finger in the eye at a certain point.
*  Yeah, but this I think will eliminate a lot of those.
*  I believe so.
*  I believe it will eliminate a lot.
*  I don't believe it will eliminate all of them.
*  It might eliminate half.
*  It's going to elevate the performance big time.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, for sure, it's going to prevent a lot of knuckle breaks.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  With the strapping against the metacarpals, 100% is going to make it a lot easier for
*  the hand wrappers to be able to make a wrap that's going to fit in the glove
*  and then be able to do what they're good at.
*  And less hand injuries will make for better fights.
*  We fight less longer in their career too.
*  We fight like four inches farther than boxers and it has to be accounted for.
*  So what he's talking about.
*  And that's the lead knuckle.
*  So in boxing, it's this knuckle because of close range short hooks.
*  Right.
*  Short hooks.
*  At long range, when I'm at this range, you have a tendency of leading with your front knuckle
*  and that's why the front knuckle is always landing first.
*  Long range because of kicks and take down times.
*  You're about two feet further out than you would be in boxing.
*  Speaking from a heavyweight division.
*  This is awesome stuff, man.
*  I'm really excited that you're so pumped up about it.
*  I get down about this shit.
*  I'm like a little child, man.
*  It's really clearly better than anything else and these mitts are fucking fantastic.
*  Those are three, right?
*  I had to make myself good ones.
*  So you make them like this but you also make them longer like a time made as well.
*  I have all sorts of stuff.
*  He makes whatever.
*  If you want one little longer, he'll make it a little longer.
*  Every one of my patterns are my patterns.
*  That's the first and only one he's ever made this size.
*  Everyone's different.
*  And I test it first.
*  That's one thing that we've done.
*  We've done right now five years worth of research and development to create the patents.
*  Make sure the patents were right.
*  We got the patents on the headgear, patents on the shin guards,
*  patents on the MMA glove, design patent and technology patent.
*  The strapping system is a utility patent which is technology.
*  Super cool.
*  What's going to control a lot of shit in the sports industry?
*  Outside of this kind of equipment, what are your thoughts on like strength and conditioning
*  and how do you organize that for your fighters?
*  Do you bring in an additional strength and conditioning coach?
*  Yes, we have one that works on the outside through Lauren Lando,
*  one of the best out there.
*  And he's a guy underneath Lauren.
*  I look at them as how the NFL looks at them.
*  They're there to make you more explosive, more powerful,
*  but they're not there to condition you.
*  I condition the athletes.
*  I condition them for the fights.
*  They get them sharper.
*  They get them more balanced.
*  They get their all the stability.
*  So you have them doing strength work and stability work and the conditioning is all done.
*  With fight training, it has to be sport specific.
*  Interesting.
*  But we gauge the rounds.
*  Like if he's going three rounds, he's going to one, maybe two times go four, maybe five rounds.
*  Everything else is three rounds.
*  Sometimes two, I'll pull them back, pull them out.
*  If I start seeing them get lazy or he might make a stupid mistake or he's just tired through the week.
*  And we gauge the training regimens like hard in the beginning,
*  slow down at the end of the week because you start to make lazy mistakes because your body's tired.
*  That's where I've seen a lot of injuries happen.
*  Do you work with the strength coach to have like a coordinated schedule?
*  So you say, hey, he's going to be sparring today.
*  Let's not have any strength.
*  We change that throughout the fight.
*  Like for each fighter that we're fighting different stuff, it will change it for that.
*  If he needs to be stronger, if he needs to be faster, it's on the game plan that I put together prior to the fight.
*  And then with what he's doing and where we get the most use out of him too,
*  he makes the biggest gains is off of training camps.
*  That's where he makes the biggest gains is where he gets stronger.
*  It's where he's consistently working and pushing more weight.
*  And when it comes to a fight, can we start to pull back just a touch?
*  And you said you do running as well?
*  Oh, yeah, we do hill running like mountain running where we'll do sprints on Tuesdays
*  right after sparring.
*  So his legs are shot.
*  So we'll go out and hit some sprints.
*  It's early in the week.
*  So we go and spike the heart rate right after he's got dead legs from sparring.
*  Right after and then Saturday on a fresh day.
*  So he spars on Friday.
*  Then Saturday, we go and do a long distance run, which is only like two miles.
*  And it's very inclined just so it's not hard on his joints and it keeps him.
*  18 minutes is my best time.
*  Yeah, you hit really good one last time.
*  But it again, it's the legs are key.
*  I can't.
*  Laura Landau had told me one time, man, running is not the best for you long distance.
*  I say, I know when I fight like when you run and you stop running,
*  your legs want to keep moving like in boxing.
*  I know when I was running because my feet wanted to move.
*  And when you get hit with a shot, your feet still are active.
*  You don't get like, oh, get ploddy.
*  So there's that benefit.
*  And again, strong legs are key.
*  That's what you're saying.
*  Legs are the first thing to go every time.
*  Yeah, it seems like there's something there's a benefit to running with fighting.
*  It's different than any other sport.
*  Look at Nate Diaz.
*  He talks about it all time.
*  And he's got one of the best chins.
*  Like he just goes.
*  He's got a flow.
*  He's got that momentum that he just keeps and carries and carries.
*  Long distance runners have that mindset where they can just go.
*  Doesn't matter.
*  It's like rolling.
*  If you roll for an hour, it's different.
*  You just grapple for an hour.
*  You've got to be able to stay consistent.
*  You think better.
*  You become smarter.
*  You don't just go out there and say, all right, I got to be this fucking brute and
*  win this fucking thing.
*  You have to pace yourself.
*  Yeah, I don't do longer than 20, 25 minutes runs because I don't want to pace myself.
*  I want to push it.
*  I don't have to fight more than 25 minutes.
*  Right.
*  You make it like a fight.
*  Rose runs a lot.
*  She has a different thing, too.
*  She's a runner.
*  She can run.
*  I'm not a runner.
*  She made me stop running.
*  Really?
*  I thought I could hit a time that was not even close to hers.
*  I was running consistently.
*  I was like, man, I'm feeling good.
*  It made me feel so good.
*  I was like, I'm going to hit a seven-minute mile, at least 759 on it.
*  I went out and, man, I ran a mile harder than I could ever run.
*  I had asthma the whole time.
*  I was like, oh, man, I'm going to be good.
*  I might be low sevens.
*  Man, I looked at my stopwatch.
*  Right as I stopped, I was like 850 something.
*  I've always been the worst runner, man.
*  He quit.
*  He's like, I'm done.
*  I swear.
*  I'll do something.
*  I hit the bag.
*  This is Zach Bitter.
*  Zach Bitter holds the world record for the fastest 100 miles.
*  He ran 100 miles at a seven-minute mile pace.
*  Jeez.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's insane.
*  He ran 100 miles in, I think it was 11 hours and 40 minutes total.
*  That's insane.
*  It's crazy.
*  And then he did another 100 miles.
*  This is the one he did at a seven-minute pace on a treadmill.
*  So this 100 miles on a treadmill, what is it like?
*  Seven minutes and 15 second miles or something crazy like that?
*  For 100 fucking miles.
*  That's a lot of patience.
*  That's almost like you've ever seen a different kind of person.
*  That's actually better though than planking.
*  There's the people's planking for days.
*  What are you doing mentally?
*  What the hell are you thinking about?
*  You're just looking at carpet the whole time.
*  Yeah, I guess if you listen to something very interesting.
*  Maybe a book.
*  Something that captivates you.
*  You like any books?
*  I love books on tape when I run.
*  It's my favorite thing.
*  But I'm worried about mountain lions these days.
*  I run with my dog and I'm also worried about rattlesnakes.
*  I've been just listening to the sound of my feet.
*  Nice.
*  And breathing.
*  It's cool being out there with your dog too.
*  There's something super cool about that.
*  Yeah, we did it today.
*  I love it, but I'm worried about snakes, man.
*  These motherfuckers are everywhere out here in California.
*  I see Brendan showing pictures like two days in a row.
*  Every day.
*  He sees rattlesnakes on his trail.
*  It's crazy.
*  He's biking in an area that has a high concentration of rattlesnakes.
*  But I ran over one once with my old dogs.
*  The dogs aren't alive anymore.
*  And we, not because of this, but they just got old.
*  But I ran over this snake and I didn't even realize it was a rattlesnake until
*  I was in the air over it.
*  I thought it was a stick because it was totally flat.
*  And it was a part where I'm really pushing.
*  The part in the run.
*  And I turned the corner.
*  Dogs ran right the fuck over it too.
*  Damn.
*  I'm in the midair and I'm like, oh my god, it's a fat rattlesnake.
*  Like fat, like my wrist, man.
*  It was a big fucker.
*  I'm from southern Arizona, man.
*  We have a lot of rattlesnakes.
*  Oh my god.
*  Arizona has the fucking big ones, man.
*  Yep.
*  You made a good visual of that.
*  I can actually, I have that in my mind now.
*  You jumping over that thing.
*  That was a good visual.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  In the air over him, I was realizing, I'm like, oh my god.
*  Can I ask you a question?
*  Yeah.
*  So look what you got.
*  This is super cool.
*  Do you miss doing Fear Factor?
*  Like that?
*  No.
*  I don't know.
*  So I'll tell you what.
*  I love that show.
*  And the time I was talking with the guys out there, one of my favorite times were actually,
*  I was like, oh, I like that dude.
*  There was a chick who was getting, some dude was talking shit to her.
*  And you told, you called the dude out.
*  It was ready to fuck him up on the cell.
*  You remember that?
*  No.
*  You had called him out and he was being aggressive to the chick on the show.
*  And you're like, hey, man.
*  Can't be talking like that.
*  He got aggressive with you and you're like, all right, we can fucking do this shit.
*  You know, I think you're confusing it.
*  This is what happened.
*  A girl punched a guy and then you, and then the guys, the girl's husband got mad.
*  That's why I never forget.
*  I was like, hell yeah.
*  Fear factor is going to be a fight with the host.
*  I didn't know your name at the time, but I'll never forget it, bro.
*  Then I put him in a tight clinch and I was trying to figure out, I didn't want to choke him.
*  Cause if I choke him, then I'm doing something to him.
*  Yeah.
*  And I didn't want to knee his brains out.
*  But I was like, I'm like, I have him.
*  If he does something, then I could do it.
*  But I'm like, let me just hold this dude in the plum and just, just also let him know how weak he is.
*  Yeah.
*  You hold someone by their neck.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You just know.
*  Never grapple before.
*  You just know.
*  You wag them around and they're like, uh.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  So in that time of your life, did you know where you'd be?
*  Oh no, I never know where the fuck I'm.
*  I just do things.
*  You do it really good.
*  Like I'm such a goal setter.
*  Like I'm a dreamer and I like, it's like magical to me.
*  It's fucking cool.
*  I love it.
*  I love that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not much of a.
*  I wanted to ask that because again, you have come a long way, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, but it's all just keep going.
*  Just grind.
*  One day at a time.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not a, I'm not a one day.
*  I'm going to be on top of the podcast world.
*  There's no thought thinking about it at all.
*  It's one day.
*  I get one day.
*  I'll look back and see what I've accomplished.
*  But right now.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't, I just enjoy what I do.
*  So I keep doing it and I try to do it my best, but the fear factor thing was it was, look,
*  it was a great job.
*  It was a great job.
*  I've made, I made money.
*  It was fun.
*  I allowed me to do a lot of things.
*  It also gave me fuck you money so I could do whatever I wanted.
*  So like from the money I made from fear fact, that actually helped my comedy because I didn't
*  worry about saying anything because I was like, I don't give a fuck.
*  I'm good, man.
*  I put that money.
*  I really didn't live that lavishly.
*  So I'm like, I put a lot of money away.
*  I'm like, I got fuck you money.
*  And then once you have fuck you money, you tend to say fuck you more often.
*  And then you get more fuck you money because you, you, you could be yourself, you know,
*  but it was a job.
*  Fear factor was a job.
*  Whereas like this never feels like a job.
*  I enjoy it, especially because I get to pick who's on.
*  You know, I don't have anybody on and I'm not interested in actually telling you what to say.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  No one's bringing guest list to me and say, these are the people you're going to have on this week.
*  I'm like, oh Christ, you know, like you see those guys that host the night show or any
*  of those shows like that.
*  That's what they have.
*  They have like someone comes to them with a list like, and then it's fake because whether they
*  want to be around them or not, they have to act like they want to be.
*  They pretend.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you know it at home.
*  So everything has this air of fakeness.
*  Whereas people could tell here, we're just having a conversation.
*  It's having fun.
*  That's why we love fighting so much.
*  It's so real.
*  It's as real as it gets.
*  That's the old UFC logo.
*  It's as real as it gets.
*  Yeah.
*  So true.
*  But that is what it is.
*  How cool is it though, Dana White stepped up and came out and fucking had some fucking fights.
*  I'm glad.
*  Hey.
*  I'm glad he didn't wait.
*  I'm glad.
*  I'm so glad that he had the balls and he was right.
*  And meanwhile, like everybody got tested.
*  Like ESPN, a lot of places, like not ESPN, but there was a ESPN asked me about it.
*  But some places were actually upset that I was shaking people's hands.
*  So I heard that you were supposed to do interviews outside, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They had this crazy thing.
*  We all got tested.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  One green card girl has no mask on.
*  And every coach does.
*  My coaches didn't wear masks.
*  They're the only ones that didn't wear masks.
*  So the thing was, is I'm back in the locker room and the commissioner is there with a mask on.
*  Safety.
*  And he's like this.
*  He's like, you need to have a mask on and now you have to have goggles on.
*  And I'm like, listen, I said, first off, show me it in the rule book.
*  I know I need rubber gloves.
*  I've seen in the rule book.
*  I know the fucking rules.
*  You need to have gloves on and every state is different, but most of them have the rubber
*  gloves.
*  You have to have rubber gloves on.
*  But I said, all right, show me in the rule book.
*  I know it's not in there and I need to be able to be there for my fighter for safety.
*  That's number one.
*  He needs to be able to hear me and everything that I'm doing.
*  I'm there for him and his safety.
*  You're just a fucker.
*  The goggles going to do like it just makes no fucking common sense.
*  No, it's everyone's lost their minds.
*  Everyone's lost their mind.
*  Everyone's paranoid of this.
*  First of all, this kills less than one tenth of one percent, particularly talking about
*  people that are really healthy like you guys.
*  It's zero risk.
*  He was about to fight and he had it.
*  That's how bad he felt.
*  Exactly.
*  Jack O'Rae was literally made weight.
*  Gonna fight.
*  Yeah, wait, no coughing.
*  Nothing.
*  Didn't even know he had it.
*  Just had a feeling he might have had it because family members had it.
*  Who's around somebody?
*  Yeah, it's not something, it's people that are metabolically challenged.
*  They're the people that have insulin resistance problems.
*  The people that are vitamin D deficient.
*  The people that have asthma, obesity.
*  All those people are in trouble.
*  They're gonna get fucked up if they catch this disease.
*  When you see the numbers drop drastically for the flu, heart disease, heart attacks,
*  it's gonna be proof that something was fucking wrong.
*  They thought it was gonna be way worse than it was.
*  But the problem is when everybody's fucking tested, and we're here, there's 1100 tests
*  the UFC did, three guys tested positive, they sent those people out.
*  Everybody was tested.
*  We all knew we were okay.
*  It's the common sense shit that drives me crazy.
*  When people just don't have the fucking common sense,
*  I'm like that, it just makes no fucking common sense.
*  It was a sheep mentality too.
*  Everybody's like, go back, love, masks, masks.
*  Can't go anywhere, everyone's wearing a mask.
*  Not Texas.
*  I went to Texas last week, I ate at a real restaurant.
*  We ate at a restaurant in Florida.
*  We did too, it was nice.
*  We ate at Morton's.
*  I mean, the waiters are all forced to wear masks and shit like that.
*  I guess, whatever.
*  But just to sit down at a fucking restaurant and have a nice meal and a glass of wine.
*  Hey, no traffic here?
*  There is positives.
*  Right now, yeah, for now.
*  But when it opens up, it's gonna be broke people that are angry, driving like fucking maniacs.
*  It's gonna be dangerous.
*  Not wanting to go back to work because they were getting paid more from unemployment than
*  they were at their fucking job.
*  There's a lot of that too.
*  And where's that money coming from?
*  Oh my God.
*  Where's that money coming from?
*  Probably from a little bit from our pockets.
*  I'm very, very, very happy that Dana White stepped up and did that fight in Florida
*  and that it worked out well.
*  And it felt real different.
*  And I felt real, very, very fortunate.
*  I was thinking while I was there, I was like, wow, there's not a lot of people that get to be here
*  live for this.
*  And then when you and Tony fought and it turned out to be absolutely one of the best title
*  fights of all time.
*  All the fights though.
*  You guys were super privileged.
*  Oh yeah, I felt like that.
*  Just think about all the people with Uber amounts of money that would just pay for me and Tony
*  to go fight in their house.
*  Yes, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Like that's what you had.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  That should be next.
*  That's a good idea.
*  That's always been, hey, I got that.
*  Any rich people want me, if I'll bring someone, we'll fight for your entertainment.
*  That is so awesome.
*  We will do that.
*  I probably get some calls from Saudi Arabia.
*  Home fights.
*  Yeah, you're going to get some Dubai phone calls.
*  I have a job.
*  I have skills.
*  They give you paid.
*  Justin, how much time you need for this?
*  How much money?
*  Two days.
*  It was also, there was a gap between the table and the cage that didn't exist normally too.
*  There was, they made a...
*  Use your cage side, right?
*  Yeah, usually we're touching the cage.
*  That's the funniest shit is you guys stand next to each other doing your interviews.
*  Yeah.
*  And then all of a sudden you had different tables.
*  No logic.
*  Just so, no logic.
*  And they were, people were upset.
*  There was an article written about the fact that I didn't use social distancing inside
*  the octagon.
*  We were tested.
*  Shaking hands.
*  I know exactly.
*  We were tested.
*  What are you talking about?
*  People are just looking for shit to complain about.
*  By the way, these fucking two guys are about to fight.
*  Yeah, we're going to swap body.
*  No more social distance unfriendly thing ever.
*  What's his name?
*  Stephen A. Smith said that he thought that you guys didn't grapple because you were
*  afraid of coronavirus.
*  I thought you were joking, bro.
*  I thought you were joking.
*  I don't dislike him.
*  No, he said that and he meant it.
*  No, I thought you were totally...
*  He did.
*  I laughed like you did.
*  He fucking meant it.
*  He meant it.
*  He did say it.
*  He meant it.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  He didn't just say it.
*  He fucking meant it.
*  We're literally swapping blood here.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Like this is the HIV world, hepatitis world.
*  Yes, yes, everything.
*  You name it, you get it.
*  Staff, everything.
*  Anything through blood.
*  But that kind of, that kind of talk.
*  Stephen A. Smith though, he's a personality.
*  Yeah, I love that.
*  He's got hot takes on things.
*  So when he says things...
*  He could have not meant it.
*  He could be as smart as, smarter than we think and said it because of the reaction he went
*  through.
*  It's a fun thing to say.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It causes fucking shit.
*  Yeah, it's a lot.
*  Listen, he makes his living that way.
*  We're all talking about him.
*  I mean, that's how he makes his living.
*  He makes his living, getting people to talk about some of the things he says.
*  He's a very engaging personality.
*  You don't have to use that in the next interview though.
*  I don't grapple because it's so...
*  Yeah.
*  I'll use wrestling when they know that.
*  I'll use wrestling.
*  I knew this shit was coming for the last seven years.
*  I hit him so hard because I was scared he was going to touch me and get that corona on me.
*  I was trying to keep him six feet back.
*  I think, real quick on the fight, I think people are like, why didn't he grapple?
*  And a huge factor in the Khabib fight is going to be my feetwork.
*  There was never a spot when he felt comfortable to close the distance.
*  I was constantly too far away and staying off the fence.
*  So that's going to be huge against Khabib.
*  Well, you have the style.
*  If you wanted to say, okay, what kind of style do you think would work against a guy like Khabib?
*  First of all, a guy was a fantastic defensive wrestler, like you said.
*  And then a guy was a superior striker.
*  And those two things you have.
*  You've got to stay off the fence.
*  Yeah.
*  You've got to have feetwork.
*  Without the feetwork, you can't stay off the fence.
*  But Khabib's whole game is...
*  He's a great grappler as well, but his whole game is using that grappling in the fight.
*  Against the fence.
*  Yeah.
*  If he's taking a shot in the open, it's to drive you to the fence to finish the takedown.
*  He's not getting takedowns in the open.
*  Interesting.
*  You go watch all of his fights, you're going to see maybe five, a handful, if that,
*  of takedowns in the actual center of the cage.
*  He'll start in the middle, but he's going to push you.
*  It's to push you to the cage and use the cage.
*  It's going to be my feetwork.
*  It's going to be me keeping that distance where he feels slightly uncomfortable.
*  Like when he did go for the Emunari roll, I was just too far.
*  He thought he was close enough, but I was just too far.
*  Right.
*  Well, he was already beaten down by that point.
*  Yeah, that was the first fight too.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  He's super sneaky.
*  Like the one he hit on Barbosa was sneaky.
*  It would have been the same in the first round because of the distance I was keeping.
*  In order to shoot a double leg, you have to be at a distance in which you feel comfortable.
*  In wrestling, it's always, unless my head's touching your head, I should never take a shot
*  because I'm too far away.
*  Controlling the distance, staying off the fence is going to be
*  the most important thing in the world when it comes to that fight.
*  When are they talking about for that fight?
*  I mean, we got the same manager, so.
*  That's kind of crazy.
*  Whenever we want.
*  Yeah, the same manager.
*  That is kind of crazy.
*  That is a G, man.
*  He's got, well, Henry just left, but 125, 135.
*  Do you think Henry's done for good?
*  125, 135, 205, 155, and 170.
*  I mean, I don't know any manager that's ever had that many champions in the stable.
*  I think Henry a year and a half from now is like, hmm.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's business.
*  Yeah, he wants big money.
*  You know, that's what he does.
*  Look, he's one of the absolutely undeniably, the greatest combat sport.
*  Always had issues with people getting paid.
*  I love it.
*  Like, Henry just loves the fight.
*  Like, their technique is just so fun to watch.
*  Yeah, so fast.
*  I mean, Henry's a special guy.
*  He really is.
*  I mean, look at the guy who won the gold medal in the Olympics, won two division,
*  and then he's winning by stoppages against world-class guys smashing people.
*  Yeah, he's amazing.
*  He really is amazing.
*  But I respect his choice.
*  I mean, the guy decides to go out on top and will go down in history
*  is one of the greatest of all time for sure.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  The UFC is probably, you know, as athletes,
*  the hardest people to do business with in the world.
*  So when you do have the cards in your hand, you have to go to war for yourself
*  because no other time will you be able to.
*  But the only time he's going to have those cards is when he's actually the champion.
*  Right now, he is the champion.
*  If he decides to vacate the title like he has, they remove him from the rankings.
*  They don't just give it back to you.
*  I believe that, well, he can earn it.
*  He doesn't have no problem doing it.
*  He'll get a title shot immediately.
*  Right, but he would not be the champion going into the fight.
*  So there's like financial considerations.
*  But I believe that was him playing his cards, going to war, you know?
*  And they don't respect you enough.
*  And so eventually you have to, at what point do you say no?
*  Right.
*  I think legitimately he's probably done too.
*  When you stop and think about the fact that he retired from wrestling at 21,
*  not even at the peak of his powers, right?
*  After he wins a gold medal.
*  And then the fact that he came back from that first round stoppage to DJ
*  and then beats him in the rematch, like, what was it, like two years later?
*  And with his knees, his ankle always looking like he goes out.
*  Like with that, with the Moritz fight and in that DJ fight,
*  just so crazy overcoming that and just getting, gosh.
*  He has nothing left to accomplish.
*  The Marlin Marais fight was incredibly impressive.
*  Oh, gosh.
*  Marlin's so fucking good, man.
*  So nasty with his kicks.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  There was like taking ass kicking for a round and then overcome that.
*  And then come back in the second round, just blew himself to his chest
*  and started smashing him.
*  The clinch, he was so strong.
*  He's a very intelligent person.
*  Yeah.
*  But retiring like that, if truly just go out, like no one's done it like that.
*  Like George has done it, but he had a rough fight prior to it.
*  Then he came back later.
*  Like the thing is, is no one's done it.
*  I always say do things outside the box.
*  Be remembered.
*  I think he'll fight again.
*  He may.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he will.
*  Captain Eric thinks he's going to fight again.
*  I think, but I do think it'll be on his terms, which is ultimately all he's fighting for.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, listen, man, the guy, he's done amazing stuff.
*  So the fight with you and Khabib, you both have the same manager.
*  You're talking about September.
*  Are they saying that with you?
*  I mean, so we, again, we both, pretty much we decide.
*  I mean, God, I hope they have a fucking audience.
*  We don't have, we don't decide.
*  The UFC is the boss.
*  They will.
*  But you can't make anybody fight.
*  And I'm ready in September.
*  He's ready in September.
*  So it's perfect.
*  Now, I know Vegas is going to at least allow some audiences in July, supposedly,
*  because I'm at that park theater, the one that's right across the street from T-Mobile.
*  I'm there in July for doing a comedy show.
*  It's supposedly going to actually happen.
*  They haven't canceled it.
*  They haven't canceled it.
*  So I'm like, all right, is this real?
*  I saw New Jersey.
*  New Jersey opened up pro sports.
*  With an audience?
*  I don't believe so.
*  I don't see that part.
*  Yeah, that's huge.
*  You and Khabib, I mean, as much as it was cool to see you and Tony fight with no audience,
*  I kind of want to see them fucking back to house.
*  As much as I loved fighting with no audience, I want them there.
*  The spectacle of that fight, that's such a big fight.
*  Yeah, it's such an experience.
*  It's the biggest challenge of his career.
*  It's the biggest challenge of Khabib's career.
*  It's the biggest challenge of your career.
*  100%.
*  Yeah, I mean, Khabib's the greatest at what he does.
*  Like, that's again, we can't take anything away from that.
*  It's, when you look at well-rounded fighters, he's well-rounded, but he's great in what he does.
*  And that is like what made Chuck Liddell great.
*  Like, he had thunder in his hands and he's brawl and brawl.
*  Like, you get hit by him, he's great at what he does.
*  And that's what's so exciting is having opportunities to be able to step up.
*  That's what I'm really excited for.
*  I know he's excited for.
*  And again, no one's got to see his wrestling.
*  And I met this guy watching him wrestle and what he does was so unique.
*  It's a total different style of wrestling and that's hard to train for.
*  And it's kind of like a hidden weapon.
*  So I feel like we're bringing something unique into this.
*  I think it's a very unique fight.
*  And it's also, Tony was thought to be the biggest threat to that title
*  because Tony is such a good grappler and he's so good on his feet and he
*  fucks people up on his feet.
*  So him fighting you and you stopping him, like you take that spot now.
*  And also your style in my opinion is better.
*  The thing about Tony's style is that Tony can fight off of his back.
*  He's not worried about takedowns and he submits a lot of guys.
*  He was going to fight that fight with the mindset of being okay on his back.
*  Yeah, that was the thought process.
*  Whereas your thought process is completely different.
*  Being such a great defensive wrestler, but also being the superior striker.
*  Totally.
*  It's a very dangerous fight for Khabib.
*  Very dangerous.
*  Especially the confidence you must have coming off of that five rounds with Tony.
*  It feels good.
*  I mean, I know how bad those kicks hurt.
*  You know, if I can touch your calf, I'm never kicking above the knee anymore.
*  Really?
*  It's only below.
*  No, he will.
*  If you ever, not on purpose, not on purpose.
*  Never.
*  Really?
*  It's not on purpose.
*  The calf kick is so devastating.
*  So devastating.
*  In the clinch, you're going to kick above the knee.
*  Maybe.
*  That's a not never.
*  Well, yeah, I'll try to break their knee by hypersending it.
*  But from the outside, you could fire that different distance.
*  You're so much more safe.
*  And there's so many nerves and ligaments that run through that part that have no protection.
*  Your thigh has, you know, your quad is a big muscle.
*  It's hard to get through your quad to those nerves.
*  You could touch the nerves.
*  That's why, you know, when he said Henry's calf and foot don't hurt,
*  it's because he got kicked in the calf.
*  Yeah.
*  The nerves stop firing.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like my old handler and belt toys.
*  It's unique, right?
*  If I can touch, I got to touch Habib there four times and then he's compromised.
*  Yeah.
*  Once he's compromised.
*  He can't shoot.
*  He can shoot, but he has to have the fence.
*  Right.
*  If he doesn't have the fence, he's fucked.
*  There's no fucking way.
*  Yeah.
*  Promise you that.
*  It has to be in the middle.
*  So.
*  And he can give me, there might be a scramble.
*  He might out scramble me in the middle once or twice.
*  But if he wants to take me down, he's going to have to put me against the fence.
*  Now, once they set this fight, you need eight weeks.
*  Is that what you want to get prepared?
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  So we're getting close to that, right?
*  We're in June and just a week or so.
*  Yep.
*  June, July, August.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm taking, I take 30 days off.
*  But they didn't give you a specific timeline.
*  I don't know anything.
*  Yeah.
*  Just September.
*  And they didn't say it's Fight Island?
*  Is it Fight Island?
*  My manager probably knows more details than I do.
*  Fight Island seems like a fucking mess.
*  There's not a lot.
*  It does.
*  I guess what I would think, Treasure Island or they open it up in Treasure Island.
*  I need to see this place on Google.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  It's like fucking that movie Contact where they zoom in, zoom in closer and you see the things.
*  It's also like, I want to like look on Google map.
*  Look, they're fucking constructing the octagon.
*  They built it, they put a whole bunch of dirt.
*  Dana won't even tell me.
*  They don't have to bring it up.
*  Dana tells me everything.
*  He won't tell me.
*  And where's this fucking island?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know nothing, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not sure if it's real.
*  Yeah. It might be just saying it just so he could get another day set for his little spot
*  in Vegas and just be like, oh man, we don't need to.
*  For international fights, it seems like the only option.
*  Yes.
*  Until the US opens back up.
*  You ain't getting visas right now.
*  No, you're not getting visas and I don't even know how they're going to,
*  they're going to have to fly everybody private to this fucking island.
*  Yeah.
*  I want them to know if I can get back.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing, right?
*  Where are you going to land?
*  Your win bonus includes a flight.
*  If you lose, you got that boat in the oar.
*  You land in Mexico.
*  You land in Tijuana and then you have a boat.
*  You got to get to San Diego and then we'll drive you home.
*  It's crazy, but I love the fact that they decided to do all these different things.
*  Like have the Tai Chi Palace fights.
*  That got canceled because the governor got his panties in a wad, but this Florida thing was
*  great and I'm glad that the fights are rolling again.
*  This weekend's a tough fight, man.
*  Tyron and Gilbert, that's a tough fight for Tyron.
*  Are they doing it in Florida?
*  I don't know where they're doing that.
*  Where is that fight?
*  I don't...
*  It might be an Apex fight.
*  I know they're trying to move there.
*  Actually, I think it is because they were saying if not, they would move it to Arizona.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it was for this fight.
*  Yeah, Arizona doesn't give a fuck.
*  That's where I'm from.
*  That's the Wild Wild West.
*  It is the Wild Wild West.
*  You can have an open carry gun.
*  Have you seen the movie Tombstone?
*  Yeah.
*  So 40 miles north of that is where I grew up.
*  Las Vegas Apex Center.
*  Now here's interesting as well because the Apex Center is a smaller fight, a smaller octagon.
*  Instead of a 30-foot octagon.
*  I bet they'll move it.
*  They have to move a 30-foot in there.
*  No.
*  No, dude.
*  I wouldn't want to fight.
*  That's like at the palms.
*  When you fight at the palms, you fight with a smaller one.
*  Yeah, the old days.
*  Yeah.
*  So this one is a 25-foot octagon.
*  It's smaller, but I think it's a good size.
*  It is smaller, but it's not too small.
*  25 is not too small.
*  20 is almost too small.
*  20 is small.
*  But this is 25.
*  He fought in the square cage out there at the—
*  Victory.
*  Victory in the square cage.
*  So that's—
*  The cage I fought in in Rage of the Cage, that thing was maybe like 12-foot, 10-foot.
*  It was like boom, you're fighting.
*  Speaking of the cage, the movie The Big Boom, I just watched that the other night.
*  It was classic with you in it.
*  You were like, here comes the boom.
*  Here comes the boom.
*  You were like, signing people for fights.
*  It was classic.
*  The summer texas.
*  But the cage in there would have fallen apart.
*  So it's the best.
*  Movies like that are just the best.
*  Yeah, they never get it right.
*  Warrior.
*  Warrior didn't get it right.
*  They fought two days in a row.
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  You ever seen someone in a day after a fight?
*  Yeah, no.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  So stupid.
*  Classic, dude.
*  This is Hollywood bullshit.
*  It was awesome, though.
*  That was some entertainment for me.
*  It was fucking awesome.
*  The Apex Center is going to be very interesting because that's even smaller.
*  Way smaller.
*  Because it was weird being in that 15,000-seat place in New York.
*  When I got in there, I looked around and I was like, this is fucking weird.
*  Crazy.
*  They could have had that at the hotel.
*  They could have had a conference room.
*  I've been in some fights like that where you got promoter promotes for the first time.
*  They're like, cool.
*  Have your fighters.
*  And you're just hoping your fighter gets paid because you look at the crowd.
*  There's like 12 people.
*  Yes.
*  And they got an arena like that.
*  I've seen that.
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen it.
*  I've been in part of some events where you're hoping your guys get paid.
*  Because you show up and fight, but there ain't no one in the crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was unique because you have the TV.
*  You know you're on the big show.
*  But it was just super unique.
*  Well, Gilbert's already done that.
*  He's already done no crowd because he did the no crowd in Brazil.
*  He fought Damian Maia.
*  So he's used to the experience.
*  Tyron, this will be Tyron's first fight like that.
*  This is different.
*  What is different about it?
*  When you walk in the octagon and Bruce Buffer is,
*  Justin, the highlight, KG.
*  He's screaming and nothing.
*  You don't hear anything.
*  There's no people.
*  It's weird.
*  You just hear the echoes of his sound.
*  Such a fucking special place at that time.
*  I have no idea.
*  I'm there, but I'm not there.
*  What is happening in your head?
*  There's literally nothing.
*  Like nothing.
*  You just go blank.
*  Pure bliss.
*  Just peace.
*  Really?
*  Weird, yeah.
*  Peace.
*  No nerves?
*  I don't feel a thing.
*  Really?
*  So I get in there.
*  You know, I looked him in the eyes.
*  And then he broke for a second and I was like,
*  all right, give me some water.
*  I got this one for you.
*  Then it's just peace.
*  So then it's like from the minute the training camp starts,
*  like a tunnel just closing in, closing in, closing in.
*  And you get in the octagon and you just see the blue canvas,
*  the lights.
*  You can, I understand.
*  Like I noticed the lights.
*  It's really bright.
*  Oh, there's like a smell.
*  They, I smell it.
*  And then it's just, the tunnel just closes.
*  Like he's announcing, you know, I've never even seen Bruce
*  Buffer's face in there.
*  I've never heard his voice.
*  I've never heard Bruce Buffer's voice in there.
*  Really?
*  But then it just closes.
*  And the fight starts and it's just, and it just closes
*  and it's over.
*  The difference between your fights where you said you
*  haven't too much fun, like the Poirier fight or the Eddie
*  Alvarez fight.
*  And now what is the difference?
*  So that was even, so once the tunnel closed with those
*  fights, it was like over, over.
*  Now I get like, I have like three pieces from this fight
*  that I can remember.
*  And so I'm more, I'm more present now.
*  More calculated.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm as present as I can possibly be while still able to
*  rely on my reactions and my intuition.
*  So your reactions and your intuition is all the stuff that
*  you worked on in training and then you just trust it.
*  You trust that process once you get inside the octagon.
*  Yep.
*  And it's, and my timing is, my timing is unbelievable.
*  Just weird things like, like my dad's a genius.
*  My dad has honed these certain skills.
*  Like right now I'm seeing him doing it with my nephew, but
*  he'll be watching TV and he'll throw a ball to you and you
*  have to catch it as many times as you can.
*  And he'll move it back.
*  You know, he'll start throwing it sideways and you try to get
*  to a hundred.
*  First you get to 50, then you try to beat 50.
*  Then he's going outside, he's throwing a ball into the roof
*  and it's rolling down.
*  You have to kind of listen to it.
*  And as it's falling, you got to call it, trying to react to as
*  it's falling to the ground, like these small little things
*  that my dad has done, like since I was a baby.
*  Um, and my weird OCD, when I'm driving in cars as a kid, um,
*  anytime there was a shadow cast on the road, I always had to
*  blink as the shadow was in between the tires.
*  Like, so it's just my, my ability to react and not
*  hesitate is I believe what's allowing me to do that inside
*  the, the octagon in those situations.
*  Well, whatever the fuck it was.
*  Yeah.
*  Something that sounds so stupid and weird, but like those small,
*  those small little skills that I've constantly worked on since
*  I was, and I never knew why.
*  I never knew why I was doing this, but, um, now, you know,
*  hindsight is always 2020.
*  It's crazy because it's not something you could decide to do
*  as an adult, right?
*  This is something you built up your whole life and now you
*  can do it, but your split second timing and counter shots
*  with Tony was pretty spectacular.
*  Second to none.
*  No one will beat me.
*  Conor McGregor is going to, it's going to be a fucking race.
*  It's going to be, you know, we're talking about
*  milliseconds here and that's the race that we'll have.
*  Is that a fight you're looking forward to?
*  I would, I do.
*  I, I want to shut them up.
*  I would love that.
*  I really would.
*  Do you think that's a possible fight?
*  I could fight him right now if I wanted to.
*  You think so?
*  Everyone is going to say that, if that I'm lying and if it was
*  there, I would take it.
*  You know, Daniel Cormier said that the other day.
*  I'm not that fighter.
*  For one, I have an opportunity to do something that can be
*  unmatched in the history of our sport to go in there, to come
*  off the circumstances, to beat Tony like I did.
*  Go beat Habib, go beat Conor.
*  That's legendary.
*  So that's what you want to do.
*  You want to beat Khabib and then fight Conor.
*  But when you said you could fight Conor right now, why are
*  you saying that?
*  Well, he's calling me out.
*  But is he really?
*  Because he was saying something about Usman too.
*  Well.
*  And I know that's not real.
*  He doesn't want that.
*  I think he would take the fight.
*  With Usman or you?
*  With me.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  He wants to fight Habib.
*  I'm the only way you have to go.
*  If he could have got one, he picked Cowboy.
*  He could have gone through me.
*  He could have gone through me.
*  There's no, you know, if you're a fan of the sport.
*  Don't you think he matches up way better with Cowboy?
*  That doesn't matter.
*  That's irrelevant.
*  But I think it is for him.
*  I think to make a spectacular performance, I think he felt
*  like he matched up.
*  I think it was smart.
*  Yeah.
*  But now you're going to call for a title shot?
*  No.
*  Like I'm in a great position because for one, I get to fight
*  for a title.
*  There's 500 some odd people on this roster.
*  Every single one of them would want to be in my position right now.
*  But I also have the ability to bring some kind of, I always draw Blake when it comes
*  to this word, but a rhyme or a reason, a way, a way to a title shot for young guys that
*  come in.
*  They think politics run the show.
*  They ultimately do.
*  But there is a small chance that you get a say in your destiny and eliminate politics.
*  And that's what I just did.
*  Politics were going to fuck me.
*  I wasn't going to get the fight.
*  Connor was going to somehow or some way get that fight.
*  And now I got the chance to go out there and I did what I did.
*  Well, just through the virtue of your performances, you become incredibly popular.
*  And that's enough.
*  That's enough.
*  Its popularity is everything.
*  I mean, this is a game.
*  You have to win.
*  You have to win.
*  But it's also the way you win.
*  And you winning the way you did in Florida when there was nothing else going on in the
*  world.
*  There's no live sports.
*  And so you winning the way you did and doing it in such spectacular fashion against a
*  hugely respected guy like Tony Ferguson, that makes you undeniable.
*  And when you're undeniable, weird things happen.
*  Timing is everything.
*  Doors get opened.
*  Timing is everything.
*  It was a perfect time.
*  It was.
*  Destiny, whatever it is.
*  You know, I don't put anything into any of those things.
*  I just do what I can do today.
*  But timing is everything.
*  And it feels like that was part of my destiny to have the opportunity at that time under
*  these circumstances.
*  Well, it certainly is a magical storyline.
*  If you were writing a movie, I mean, that would be the best way to...
*  But when I go beat Habiba and then I beat Connor, what run in the history of this sport
*  has been better?
*  Coming off two losses, getting counted out.
*  That's what I'm here for.
*  I can inspire the world.
*  Now, do they have anything lined up for Connor now?
*  Because Connor keeps talking like something's happening.
*  He's so back and forth from the boxing to the MMA that it's again, it's...
*  Right, he keeps talking about fighting Floyd again.
*  Trying to talk people...
*  I wouldn't have...
*  That he's the number one...
*  I would say it's...
*  He said he was going to come back and do the season.
*  If you have to put an argument for yourself, you're not that man.
*  Where's the season?
*  Like, he talked about doing the season.
*  And don't get me wrong, I respect the shit out of him.
*  He can fight his ass off.
*  But he was like, I'm going to do a season.
*  I'm going to have three fights in three months or whatever he had said.
*  The whole thing is people stop listening when you're not sticking to your word.
*  And if you're going to fight, fight.
*  Stay irrelevant.
*  Pick a way, class.
*  Be just consistent as you are when you fight because he's super consistent when he fights.
*  Like, he's very talented.
*  Yeah, I said in an interview that he was losing clout among fighters and in the game.
*  Dana White's laughing at him.
*  Reporter asked him, he said, Connor says he's fighting Justin next.
*  Dana laughs.
*  That's all the proof you need right there.
*  That's you're losing respect.
*  So he has to go and fight.
*  Yeah, he has to kind of earn a position.
*  I mean, beating Cowboys nice, but he's got to kind of get another win.
*  Something else has got to happen to really sell the public on 100%.
*  You can sell a certain percentage of the public based on his name.
*  And it was at 170.
*  I mean, there's the consistency.
*  I look at it from a consistency standpoint.
*  It's like, what weight class are you going to go in?
*  I feel if he was fighting at 145, he's very unstoppable.
*  I feel like that's the weight class for him.
*  But him changing weight, if I was a coach with him, I'd be like, hey, man, pick a weight class.
*  He's so great for 145.
*  But again, he came from the hungry.
*  He's getting up to stronger dudes.
*  Like his speed is key.
*  And when you go up bigger weight classes, you start to lose your speed.
*  Well, that's why the Usman fight I thought was so ridiculous.
*  When I saw them, Usman was posting photos of that.
*  I'm like, that is so crazy because Usman is enormous and he's so powerful.
*  I was sparring with him for this camp.
*  William, he's a big dude.
*  Yeah, he's a big guy.
*  He's a big guy and he's strong as fuck.
*  Like when Usman gets a hold of guys, he drags him to the ground.
*  He's an incredible wrestler.
*  And his mind, too.
*  His mind is very, very powerful.
*  So when I was looking at that, I was like, wow, is that really happening?
*  But it's not.
*  That fight's not happening.
*  I even texted Dane about that one.
*  I'm like, come on, man.
*  I didn't know nothing about that.
*  I really haven't been working on this stuff.
*  That's when Conor's talking about 70.
*  After he fought Cowboy, he was like, I feel so good at 170.
*  I'm like, hmm, OK.
*  It's all a show.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all a game.
*  I think he really did feel good.
*  But he was fighting a guy who's not a real 170.
*  He fought a 55er.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  So your ultimate goal is to do that, to beat Conor.
*  And then what do you do?
*  Do you have a long term?
*  Fight for you.
*  Fight for you.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  And that's it.
*  That's all I need.
*  Wow.
*  What do I need after that?
*  Yeah.
*  That would be legendary.
*  I'd make plenty of money, which is ultimately what I'm here to do.
*  And I took control of my destiny, which is all I asked for.
*  Yeah, so it's good.
*  Business-wise, the smart move could be right now to fight Conor,
*  because obviously that's a lot of money.
*  I think you have more leverage beating Khabib.
*  I make way more money.
*  You make a lot more money.
*  More money when I beat Khabib and then fight.
*  Yeah.
*  And if Conor's not there, I'll fight Poirier.
*  He's not on my list.
*  Conor's not necessarily...
*  Khabib and Poirier are the two on my list right now.
*  If I fight them two with big paydays, then I'm good.
*  That's a great plan, man.
*  This is a good way to wrap this up.
*  Listen, man, it's been an honor.
*  Privilege having you guys in here.
*  Really appreciate it.
*  It's a dream come true for me, man.
*  You're a legend.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  You're a legend too.
*  And I really fucking hope these goddamn gloves make their way into the UFC.
*  Oh, they will.
*  They will.
*  It's all about timing, right?
*  They're superior.
*  And I really hope I'm there in September when you guys fight.
*  I can't wait to see it.
*  You will be.
*  I was kind of pissed.
*  This is the first fight you've ever commented.
*  You did the Eddie Alvarez fight too.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But this was the second.
*  It was fucking awesome.
*  Yeah, I was glad to hear that.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  All right.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  Thank you, guys.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye, everybody.
