# Joe Rogan Experience #2014 - Jim Gaffigan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't miss it either. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5.8s)]
*  Yeah he's got weird autoimmune issues. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=18.88s)]
*  So for him that was like an elimination diet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=22.5s)]
*  And he found out there was just a bunch of things that his body was reacting to in a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=24.72s)]
*  very negative way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=28.2s)]
*  One of them apparently was vegetables. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=29.2s)]
*  A lot of it is like just complex carbohydrates. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=31.0s)]
*  You know a lot of it is bread and pasta and stuff like that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=34.44s)]
*  A lot of people get really inflamed eating that and it causes a host of issues. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=36.92s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean it's well eventually it isn't there you know like even the problem with chemo [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  you know I'm a guy who tells diarrhea jokes so I know a lot about this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=48.2s)]
*  Isn't it isn't the expectation that if they could kind of concierge your cancer treatment [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=53.44s)]
*  to your specific type of cancer for your type of body or your type of cells that that's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=62.28s)]
*  why people are going to be able to live to 100. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=71.2s)]
*  Rich people are going to be able to live to 100. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=73.28s)]
*  I think there's definitely a lot of research that's done in that way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=76.4s)]
*  But I also think that there's so many factors when it comes to cancer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=80.8s)]
*  There's environmental factors, there's lifestyle factors like what you're eating, how much [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=86.2s)]
*  stress you're under. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=91.88s)]
*  There's a lot of genetic issues. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=92.88s)]
*  There's a lot going on when it comes to cancer. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=94.92s)]
*  Yeah I mean there is like I mean you just hear about you know people from the Philippines [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  like an entire family. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=104.56s)]
*  Everyone died of cancer at 40. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=106.64s)]
*  And you're like yeah what's going on there? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=109.28s)]
*  Yeah unfortunately some of it is genetic. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=112.56s)]
*  Some people just have a shit roll of the dice genetically. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=116.12s)]
*  Are you saying that because I have all recessive genes? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=120.52s)]
*  Do you? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=124.0s)]
*  I mean I am literally I'm like everything's recessive. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=125.0s)]
*  I literally went into the dermatologist and he's like you know what we're just gonna like [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=129.28s)]
*  you know because I don't know if you ever get the cancer stuff the basal cells. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=134.76s)]
*  He's like we should probably just chop off your arms because they're just all basal cells. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=139.08s)]
*  So it's like I am you know I'm all recessive genes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=144.96s)]
*  How did white people really white people deal with the sun back in the day before sunscreen? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=150.08s)]
*  Well I think I think some of it is you know if they're in Northern Ireland or Scotland [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=157.32s)]
*  I don't I think it's all right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=166.4s)]
*  They're also not living past 40 right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=169.6s)]
*  I mean they're kind of yeah they're like look at this thing called alcohol and then they're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=174.27999999999997s)]
*  like let's do this for the rest of our time we're on earth. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  Well back then like in the early early days they drank it because a lot of water was tainted. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Right oh yeah during Jesus's time everyone drank wine and beer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah that's why the apostles fell asleep is because they weren't drinking water there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=194.64s)]
*  were it was cheaper to drink wine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=201.04s)]
*  And it was more of a party atmosphere. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=203.6s)]
*  And probably better for you than getting horrible toxins in your water you know viruses and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=205.72s)]
*  bacteria and whatever the fuck is in still water that's sitting around for a while. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah it is like are is there any difference between any of these waters because you know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  like there's all this water I mean I like Fiji water hopefully they'll send me a case [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=223.88s)]
*  now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=227.6s)]
*  That's supposed to be pretty good. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=228.6s)]
*  But is there and that's got to be very good for the environment to have water shipped [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=229.72s)]
*  from an island in the North Atlantic. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=235.6s)]
*  Sure as long as they're using fossil fuels to get it here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean there's water 10 feet from me but I'd like to get mine from like this Nordic country [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=242.76s)]
*  that's like really far away. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=249.28s)]
*  But is there any difference between these waters except for the Poland spring. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=252.28s)]
*  There's a guy that Tom Segura and Christina Pszczewski have had on their show. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=256.24s)]
*  What's his name Martin Rince I forget his name is that an actual water connoisseur like [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=260.48s)]
*  a water expert. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=267.12s)]
*  And he rates the different mineral content and waters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  So he's like a semi-yea for water. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=272.8s)]
*  Yeah of water. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  So what is his name? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  Martin Reese. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Interesting guy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=281.68s)]
*  And he talks to them about water. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  It's all he brought a bunch of different kinds of water and tells them what's good and what's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=285.48s)]
*  bad. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=289.12s)]
*  You really ideally want water in a glass bottle. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=290.12s)]
*  You don't really want it in plastic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of issues with plastic with leaching if the water gets you know you don't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  know what's happening between the time it gets bottled and how it gets shipped to you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=299.16s)]
*  Could be sitting in the sun could be sitting in a hot warehouse and plastic bottles leach [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  chemicals into the water which are endocrine disruptors. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=308.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  Not good. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  No that's scary. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  Even water. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  Even water. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Well I remember I watched this thing about I don't know all these all the plastic that's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  in the ocean and then the fish eat the plastic and then and I just was like I'm so relieved [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=324.46s)]
*  I don't like fish. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=332.02s)]
*  Because you're always like oh fish are so good for you and I'm like now I'm going to stick [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=335.22s)]
*  to burgers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=339.14s)]
*  There's mercury too. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=340.14s)]
*  Mercury is a big one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=341.14s)]
*  There's a lot of plastics in there that some of these kids these fish they can't even like [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=342.14s)]
*  they they can't mate or whatever. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=350.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=353.86s)]
*  I know I sound scientific. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=354.86s)]
*  He's so specific. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=355.86s)]
*  Did you do a lot of research? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=356.86s)]
*  They can't do things. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=360.02s)]
*  They can't mate or something. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  They can't mate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=362.54s)]
*  They're not interested. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  They're not interested. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah not good. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah and it's a lot of people think that when you recycle plastic bottles that they get [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  recycled but they don't. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  Most I think it's something around the neighborhood of 90 percent of all plastic single-use bottles [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=374.86s)]
*  can put into landfills or they get shipped to other countries and other countries wind [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  up polluting with them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=386.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  So what's the solution? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  Well really there there are biodegradable plastics and biodegradable plastics that are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  made out of hemp fiber. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=397.38000000000005s)]
*  It's that's a real thing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=398.86s)]
*  They can make plastic made out of things other than petrochemical products. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=400.42s)]
*  Yeah but isn't it a little bit like the fake sugar like there's always I had a joke about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  it like there's oh every you know when we were growing up there was saccharin and they're [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=411.54s)]
*  like oh no it causes cancer and they're like oh here's a new fake sugar and then two years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  later that one causes cancer. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=419.82000000000005s)]
*  It's like everything causes cancer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=421.58s)]
*  They're just coming out now about aspartame. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=423.46s)]
*  They're talking about aspartame which everyone's been saying that's the one that's okay. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=425.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=429.74s)]
*  I'm like no that's not good for you either. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=430.74s)]
*  It's just sugar is the great Satan right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=432.5s)]
*  Yeah it's just not good in the form that we have it mostly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=436.74s)]
*  You know mostly it's added sugar to things and sugar from fruit is fine because it comes [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  in a digestible way. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=448.34s)]

*  It's connected to the material of the fruit. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=452.09999999999997s)]
*  It's good for you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=454.67999999999995s)]

*  I mean it has sugar but the way your body digests it it processes the fiber. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  It's a slower release. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=461.78s)]
*  What's really bad is drinking sugar like when you're drinking like Coca-Cola like that is [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=463.97999999999996s)]
*  alien to your body. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=469.02s)]
*  Your body's like how is this here? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=470.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=472.14s)]
*  This is you never there's nothing in nature that gives you sugar in that form. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=473.14s)]
*  Did you ever see that video of the evolution of the because Coca-Cola like in the 20s or [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=477.22s)]
*  30s used to be something that you would go down to the Soto shop and you would get a [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=482.62s)]
*  tiny bottle of Coke and you'd kind of have a tiny and then just the size is growing over [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  decades. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=496.14s)]
*  Leaders. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=497.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=498.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=499.14s)]
*  You know and then the 7-eleven slushy is just bananas. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=500.14s)]
*  That's the your main lining sugar just right in your blood. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=503.46s)]
*  But all right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=508.18s)]
*  So so I think that everyone understands that like sodas because I want you to get so by [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=509.18s)]
*  sued by the Coca-Cola company and the Pepsi company. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  But that is something that is obviously some. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=520.3s)]
*  But I think most even even people that do drink diet coke are like I know this is bad. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=525.86s)]
*  Yeah I mean but I do think the you know I don't think that we as a society have embraced [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=532.38s)]
*  the fact that social media is one of the worst things that has happened to human beings ever. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  For sure for health for like mental health mental health. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=554.78s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=556.2199999999999s)]
*  There's documentation. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  There's a great book called the what is it the American Mind the Jonathan Haidt book. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=558.26s)]
*  What is it called. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=565.58s)]
*  Coddling of the American Mind. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=566.58s)]
*  And it's it documents the self harm and suicide rates of young kids particularly girls. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=571.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=580.38s)]
*  It's real bad. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=581.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=582.38s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that I think is really interesting is that you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=583.54s)]
*  know you're talking about online bullying between each other like hate and vitriol and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=586.54s)]
*  just the comparing themselves to other people unfavorably. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=591.54s)]
*  And now with filters and like you're essentially comparing yourself to fiction. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=595.7s)]
*  You know it's interesting when you consider for generation upon generation people would [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=600.54s)]
*  look at their parents and their parents would say you know I had to walk five miles to school [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=607.14s)]
*  And I look at my teenagers and I'm like oh they have it harder. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=611.5400000000001s)]
*  They definitely have it harder. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  Like you know like in high school dealing with you know you were compared to people [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=617.6600000000001s)]
*  in your high school. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=622.86s)]
*  Now these kids are compared to everyone on the Internet. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=624.38s)]
*  It's like the just the you know the the the acts you know like the you know like we used [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=628.02s)]
*  When we were kids you're like hey Tommy's dad who's divorced has a playboy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=636.02s)]
*  We're going to go over there and we're going to look at it in a field. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=641.5s)]
*  Like we did that when we were like 13. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=644.98s)]
*  And now it's like the porn is thrown at you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=648.42s)]
*  And so like I look at you know I think kids got a much harder. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=652.28s)]
*  They definitely have it much harder psychologically. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah no doubt. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=660.42s)]
*  Just the online bullying and the way they tweet to each other and you know and leave [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=662.26s)]
*  Instagram messages and Snapchat. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=668.74s)]
*  It's just it's evil. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=670.66s)]
*  And they do it to each other on a daily basis and it's a normal thing for kids to just be [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=674.3399999999999s)]
*  real shitty to each other online. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=679.14s)]
*  And they don't have to see the reaction. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=681.3s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=684.66s)]
*  And it is strange because among you know it's there is this kind of the banter of the you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=685.86s)]
*  know the greatest form of affection you can give another comedian is to give them shit. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=691.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=697.3000000000001s)]
*  But that's also you also can get a temperature of how they're truly responding to it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  You know like you you know you guys pick on Bert and everything. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=705.7s)]
*  But like if you got a sense that it was truly hurting his feelings you would be more constructive [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=709.38s)]
*  about it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=714.98s)]
*  Yes for sure. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=715.46s)]
*  Yeah I mean for a little bit and then go right back then you go back to it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=716.58s)]
*  And then you would be like excuse me I have to go sit on my pile of Jimmy Buffett like money. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=719.94s)]
*  Because he is Margaritaville. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=728.9s)]
*  He's he's going to have the machine restaurants. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=730.82s)]
*  It's just inevitable. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=735.7s)]
*  Yeah he has to have them. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=736.9s)]
*  They'll be in Florida. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=737.94s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=739.3000000000001s)]
*  But they will be and there will be it is it's just inevitable. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=740.5s)]
*  There's worse food for you. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=745.46s)]
*  Yeah sure. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=747.22s)]
*  Yeah it'll be great. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=748.1s)]
*  And by the way he's going to outlive everyone. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=749.46s)]
*  That's the great irony. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=754.66s)]
*  He's going to be he's going to be crying at your funeral. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=755.94s)]
*  He's having so much fun and yet he's so unhealthy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=758.66s)]
*  But yet he's always laughing and having fun. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=762.98s)]
*  There's got to be a balance in there that's being achieved. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=764.98s)]
*  He's so unhealthy but it's but there is like you see him like snowboarding. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=768.66s)]
*  Yeah he's not like somebody like there is not ambulatory. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=774.02s)]
*  Yeah and you know like like when I think of how my dad used to drink like my dad would come home. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=778.5799999999999s)]
*  He would have a vodka and then at one point he would switch to scotch. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=784.42s)]
*  I thought that was normal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=788.26s)]
*  I'm like you know when your dad has two vodkas and then he switches. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=789.2199999999999s)]
*  And so like there but he would wake up the next morning be fine. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=792.42s)]
*  And I kind of look at Bert the same way. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=796.34s)]
*  It's like he has a stamina. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=798.58s)]
*  I mean some of it's for show obviously but like he has a stamina that is unusual. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=802.34s)]
*  He really is the machine. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=808.34s)]
*  Yeah he's got a very unusual tolerance for alcohol. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=809.94s)]
*  Yeah and he's accustomed to feeling like shit and recovering. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=814.5s)]
*  He does a lot of stuff like saunas and cold plunges and he gets IVs and he does a lot of stuff to try [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=819.46s)]
*  to mitigate the effects but yeah he's going hard. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=825.38s)]
*  Yeah it's crazy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=828.98s)]
*  I'm jealous. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=832.82s)]
*  Yeah you know I have like yesterday was our anniversary and where I had a glass of champagne [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=835.06s)]
*  with my wife and halfway through dinner I was starting to get the headache. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=841.78s)]
*  I'm like what the hell is happening to me. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=845.14s)]
*  I just can't my body's like whoa whoa. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=847.86s)]
*  Yeah when I take time off of drinking like we do sober October every year [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=852.26s)]
*  and then I'll have a day when we go back we get fucked up and the next day I'm like I'm [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  not doing this anymore. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=860.0999999999999s)]
*  This is over. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=861.78s)]
*  And so how is your drinking like all right so on an average week how often do you know like [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=863.14s)]
*  because alcohol is different from like consuming like getting high in other ways [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=871.06s)]
*  because alcohol seems kind of counter to the Joe Rogan lifestyle thing of like [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=875.62s)]
*  or are you sitting there going oh this this special cumin and laced vodka has zero calories [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=882.02s)]
*  you know is there but is so how often during the week do you get wasted. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=890.02s)]
*  Well because I own a club yeah because I'm in my club all the time yeah I very rarely [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=895.62s)]
*  drink drink I'll have a drink right like before a show like last night I had a half of a drink. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=902.6600000000001s)]
*  We were Ron White was there and he had his tequila and he was pouring drinks for everybody so I had [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=908.98s)]
*  I had a sip of his tequila I had a little bit but when I smoke pot or you know or anything else [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=913.62s)]
*  it's just no big deal like the next day I feel fine it's not yeah it's not wrecking me. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=920.6600000000001s)]
*  But all right so but you're inhaling and now I sound like the Puritan you're inhaling [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=926.4200000000001s)]
*  your lungs yeah but you're doing it in a way where it's not damaging the lungs. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=931.94s)]
*  Well it's probably not good for your lungs to just inhale burnt plant fiber yeah you know it's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=937.0600000000001s)]
*  probably not good but it doesn't show cancer on the levels that like you see from people that are [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=944.5s)]
*  cigarette smokers you also don't smoke as much like you take a couple of hits before a show [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=950.9000000000001s)]
*  it's not like you're sitting there with a pack of cigarettes and you're doing it every day [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=956.5s)]
*  right right it's different right or you're not living next to a chemical plant that you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=960.02s)]
*  environmental fact you're like working in a chemical plant like people that have to work [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=966.02s)]
*  with chemicals like that's fucking horrible people paint cars and shit like that like [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=969.54s)]
*  that's rough. Like do you ever look at the Europeans like the you know the the way that like some of our [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=975.9399999999999s)]
*  foods have genetic modified thing and then you and then the Europeans are like no we're [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=984.1s)]
*  not going to do that I'm like are we doing it wrong? We're definitely doing it wrong. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=989.62s)]
*  And so like why isn't there this groundswell I mean outside of the obvious thing of financial [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=993.5400000000001s)]
*  interests of major corporations corrupting our political system but like why is there [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1001.3000000000001s)]
*  not kind of people saying this is insane? Because of the financial issue it's it's 100% because of [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1007.14s)]
*  that because they've co-opted the media and they the media doesn't report on all these things [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1016.42s)]
*  you know the media doesn't report on so many things that are bad for you because it's bad [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1021.54s)]
*  for their interests. Well let me ask you this and we'll be right back to the Jim Gaffigan show in a [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1026.02s)]
*  minute. I'm here with Joseph Reagan Rogan. No let me ask you this so all right so Sam Bankman [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1030.82s)]
*  freed. Just got off of all charges. Off of all charges? That's totally not corrupt by the way [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1039.22s)]
*  he deserves to be free. You think he deserves to be free? Yeah go back to doing meth and hanging out [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1045.54s)]
*  with that that little floozy in that house that you had with 40 other people and banging each other. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1049.78s)]
*  Occasionally when he would when he would be in court in a suit I would be like ah that's so cute [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1054.66s)]
*  he's got a suit on. It's kind of like you know a boy at a bar mitzvah's confirmation. Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1059.22s)]
*  Just like ah look at him in a suit. Like a real man. But all right let me ask you this. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1066.82s)]
*  Fed's dropped campaign contributions charged against Sam Bankman freed but is that all his [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1072.18s)]
*  charges about everything? Are there other charges that are still available or is he a free man now? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1076.9s)]
*  I think they said he had to get a haircut which is really weird. Okay federal prosecutors are [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1081.6200000000001s)]
*  dropping campaign finance violation charges against alleged crypto crook Sam Bankman freed [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1086.98s)]
*  over a legal snafu and his extradition from the Bahamas to the U.S. Still faces 12 other charges [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1092.74s)]
*  in the case. Five more of those counts are still in question because they were added after he was [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1099.22s)]
*  extradited. It seems to me like the fix is in. Well let me ask you this. All right so a logical [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1104.58s)]
*  any comedian would look at that and go all right so somebody in the justice department was like he [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1112.18s)]
*  donated a lot to our people let's make this go away. But here's a question I have. So [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1119.22s)]
*  there is that level of corruption but do you look at that level of corruption and see it as [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1127.46s)]
*  equal to what Trump has been repeatedly busted as? Do you see those as equal or do you see like [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1137.7s)]
*  that as because you know like I wonder if like to me it's like you know like like the indictments [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1147.7s)]
*  against Trump I'm like it's gonna keep going right they're gonna there's gonna be more things [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1156.74s)]
*  whereas like this is vague corruption I'm not justifying it but like I feel like some people [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1162.1799999999998s)]
*  see this as totally equal. You think both sides are equally bad. You would have to go over the [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1169.6999999999998s)]
*  case right because the way it's been described to me and the way the CEO was looking at it he was [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1177.3799999999999s)]
*  saying that this is fraud this is like straight out fraud it's financial fraud and they were [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1182.8999999999999s)]
*  they were taking clients money and using it in a way that they were not supposed to they were [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1189.7s)]
*  funneling it off to Almeda he was not being honest about his connections to that. I don't know all [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1195.54s)]
*  the absolute specifics of the case but the way it's been described to me is that there is not [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1203.3s)]
*  enough regulation in cryptocurrency and that these people are allowed to do some really shady [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1210.1s)]
*  shit and that these people took it to the far end of this and you know they were making insane [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1215.7s)]
*  amounts of money and they were doing amphetamines and they were hanging out and having this [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1222.18s)]
*  polyamorous lifestyle with these bunch of super nerds. But you shouldn't go to jail for that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1226.74s)]
*  Not yet. Not for banging each other. No I think that's fun. I'm happy that they get to live like [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1232.18s)]
*  that like these socially awkward weirdos all of a sudden they're super rich if they were doing it [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1236.74s)]
*  above ground rather everything was cool I would be celebrating them I'd be like yay look at these [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1242.26s)]
*  they won but a lot of people lost a lot of money and you know there was also they were [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  they were being exposed by competitors by Binance and then it turns out that Binance is fucked too [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1254.34s)]
*  and they're up their ass with a microscope and they might have all sorts of problems with fraud [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1261.4599999999998s)]
*  all sorts of other things that are being lobbied against them or leveled against them I don't know [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1268.18s)]
*  you know it's it's a lot of complicated financial stuff that's outside of my realm of understanding. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1273.78s)]
*  Yeah it is interesting because the basic premise again I know nothing about crypto [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1280.66s)]
*  but isn't the basic premise of crypto is like there's no regulations that's yeah this currency [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1287.3s)]
*  is outside of it's not tied to the dollar it's you know it's you know it's there's an independence [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1294.18s)]
*  there whereas so you can't compare that to Martha Stewart going to jail for insider trading. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1302.9s)]
*  Right yeah I mean the Martha Stewart thing is interesting because Congress does what she did [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1309.94s)]
*  all the time. They mean they get access to information. Oh yeah that happened during the pandemic. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1316.98s)]
*  Tons of times. I mean and it's not just a Democrat thing everybody points to Nancy Pelosi [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1322.82s)]
*  it's a republic it's like literally 100 black and white I mean excuse me red and blue it's like [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1328.1s)]
*  across the board yeah they're all doing it and it's just something that I think everyone does [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1334.42s)]
*  that's there they they understand like bills that are going to be passed and then they immediately [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1339.62s)]
*  start buying stocks and they've always done that and it's one of the reasons why they want to be [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1345.14s)]
*  congressman in the first place. They have access to information. It's one of the reasons why they go in [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1349.46s)]
*  with a certain income and leave millionaires. Just not just millionaires like insanely rich [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1355.6200000000001s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars for you know six figure salaries. Wow. Yeah look Nancy Pelosi is a [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1361.14s)]
*  better stock trader than both Warren Buffett and George Soros. Her husband is an investment guy [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1368.98s)]
*  or he was an investment. Well he is when he works with her. Right. Like she knows things he bets [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1376.42s)]
*  he you know he places the stock options and whee. Right and that's also I mean I remember like [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1381.62s)]
*  the all the the senators that pulled out right like Richard Byrd and Kelly Loeffler and all these [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1389.94s)]
*  guys right when the pandemic and they they they they removed they sold their stocks and then they [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1396.9s)]
*  said everything's fine right. So it's like some of it is selling stocks it's not necessarily even [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1404.34s)]
*  buying. Sure yeah. But yeah. It's having information that would allow you to make not just an educated [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1409.3799999999999s)]
*  guess but you know what's going to happen. You know what's going to happen and you know that because [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1418.26s)]
*  of these decisions that are being passed that these companies are going to become far more valuable [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1423.4599999999998s)]
*  because they've got certain deals and then you bet on that and that's what it is. And it's it's [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1427.86s)]
*  insider trading. We all know it is. Yeah it's it's you know there's the corruption but it's also like [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1433.46s)]
*  that because I have a 19 year old daughter and she's amazing and she is not like if if [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1440.58s)]
*  if I brought up the idea of her pursuing a career based on financial security she would be offended [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1449.78s)]
*  and I and I say that with a little bit of a joke because I also remember like the comedians [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1456.98s)]
*  people that go into comedy are not like you know we didn't know it was going to be this type of [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1463.54s)]
*  business. We went into it because it was you know creatively fulfilling to get on stage and make [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1468.42s)]
*  strangers laugh and but like there is something at least for me having five kids it's like I really [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1475.78s)]
*  didn't care about money. You know in my 30s I remember my parents died and people were [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1483.06s)]
*  you know like we all my siblings came around we were getting stuff and I was like I'll take [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1490.1s)]
*  the immigration papers you guys can have the rest. And so like I was the youngest but like [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1494.1799999999998s)]
*  the point I'm getting to as you get older once you get a taste for comfort it's you know because I've [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1499.6999999999998s)]
*  tried to articulate to my children you know money is about freedom you know it's like the freedom to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1507.86s)]
*  like afford to go on a date you know the freedom of independence like I don't have to ask mom and [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1512.9s)]
*  dad for my help for help and so but there is a you know the perspective that changes. I'm not [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1519.7800000000002s)]
*  saying all people but like when you're 20 all right do I have enough money to get beer you know [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1528.5s)]
*  what I mean as opposed to like when you're 40 you're like all right I might need knee replacement [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1535.94s)]
*  surgery. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And like there is some you know comforts you like comforts [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1541.38s)]
*  right? You don't want to struggle right? You don't want to be scared as to where your next [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1549.22s)]
*  paycheck is coming from. Yeah I mean I fly you know commercial and I fly you know business class [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1553.5400000000002s)]
*  and it's amazing and I don't you know like if I have a gig and they're like you know I'd you know [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1561.7s)]
*  I would have to fly and coach I don't know if I want to do it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1570.1s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like I'm kind of a you know it's like is it worth being [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1579.06s)]
*  really uncomfortable for a bunch of hours? Like I have like I live in New York and I work at [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1584.26s)]
*  Wynn has Wynn's a great casino right and they have this theater and it's a great thing and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1592.8999999999999s)]
*  so there used to be all these direct flights from New York. I mean there's tons but there [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1598.74s)]
*  were some live flat things and they were like live flat? Yeah so like where you you know it's [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1603.6999999999998s)]

*  and so they essentially started getting rid of those things and I'm like I don't know if I want [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1615.86s)]
*  to perform in Vegas anymore. It's like I'm such a baby. I'm like LA yeah no there's live flat I'll [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1620.26s)]

*  Baby can't be uncomfortable for a couple hours. You can definitely get used to comfort. Yeah. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1634.98s)]
*  Yeah but it's probably not good for kids to grow up that comfortable. No. It's interesting [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1642.58s)]
*  you know it's like we all everyone that I know that's interesting had a pretty shitty childhood [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1649.62s)]
*  and rough and difficult and a lot of problems and but none of those people want that for their [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1656.1s)]
*  children even though it made them the most interesting people that I know because they [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1663.78s)]
*  got through some hard times and difficult childhoods and struggle and they developed [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1668.34s)]
*  discipline and character and you know the ability to overcome adversity. I mean it is [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1674.1799999999998s)]
*  parenting is terrifying. It is. It's terrifying. It's a complicated world. And you know you're [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1680.82s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah it's not just you it's like what are your children getting exposed to at school? What [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1694.5s)]
*  are your children getting exposed to on the streets? Yeah because when they they reach a certain age [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1698.58s)]
*  where like you can hear them actively not listening to you and you're like oh I hope your peer group [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1703.2199999999998s)]
*  is communicating some of this stuff because I've said it six times and you're obviously not hearing [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1710.74s)]
*  it you know I mean. Yeah. It's really and it's when you know when you have young kids you think oh [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1715.3s)]
*  because I think our society we kind of portray you know babies oh I couldn't sleep last night my baby [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1720.8999999999999s)]
*  was crying I had to change poopy diapers and that's the easy part. That's the easy. Yeah that's just [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1727.3799999999999s)]
*  lack of sleep. Yeah but like when it's Saturday night and they're out you're like what where are [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1734.34s)]
*  they? Right. Going to parties. It's terrifying. Yeah and who knows what's happening at these parties. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1740.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah and again it's also I mean there is you know there has been you know again going back to like [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1747.06s)]
*  these teenage kids I would say like 13 to 19. I mean you know up you know some of them missed [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1756.58s)]
*  graduation from high school some you know some of it was just a year some people it was two years [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1765.54s)]
*  but it is social media it's like also you know you know the generation of our comedians [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1771.06s)]
*  you know we were I mean how many benefits did you do about legalizing pot decriminalizing pot [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1779.94s)]
*  let's get rid of all these rules and then so what happens in Manhattan is it's decriminalized right. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1786.5s)]
*  So like every bodega is selling weed but since it's decriminalized the police are like we don't we [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1794.5s)]
*  got enough on our hands so we're not and it's decriminalized. I think it's legal in New York [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1804.98s)]
*  now. Well but here's what happens is that like my barber opens a weed shop everyone has a weed shop [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1809.78s)]
*  but unlike LA where it's it feels organized in New York it's a little bit of the wild wild west and [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1817.14s)]
*  so there's these two stores and again there's no supervision so one store starts selling mushrooms [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1824.02s)]
*  you know kind of like discreetly some of them starts you know they'll sell it to a kid that's [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1832.34s)]
*  13 where's in LA and Colorado I don't think that happens and so as a result what's happening in [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1837.86s)]
*  New York is that there's kids that like are getting stuff that since it's not regulated [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1845.3s)]
*  they're getting stuff that's laced with stuff and so instead of smoking you know spending your 16 [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1852.4199999999998s)]
*  your age of 16 years old smoking oregano for three months these kids are smoking some of the most [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1860.6599999999999s)]
*  powerful stuff that's laced with shit and then there's kids that are like you know there's kids [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1866.82s)]
*  jumping off buildings you know I mean and the thing is is like it's not talked about because [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1871.86s)]
*  it's it's you know some of these wealthy parents there's so much shame about I mean I have no idea [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1877.3799999999999s)]
*  I can't even contemplate what it would be like but like it's not in the news it's not like you [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1886.42s)]
*  know where I grew up in Indiana it's like oh that town there's meth there you know I mean it's not [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1891.7s)]
*  like that it's like there's a cover-up like this kid was going to go to this great college and he [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1896.42s)]
*  got stoned off of a vape pen that was laced with you know you know whatever that stuff that they [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1902.5800000000002s)]
*  get from fentanyl yeah and he jumped off a building and the kid wasn't suicidal the kid [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1910.18s)]
*  wasn't a total fuck-up it was and so instead of that being in the news the family's like [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1916.98s)]
*  you know it's it's brutal and again it's it's very similar to [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1924.8200000000002s)]
*  uh you know just the mental health crisis it's a tsunami what these kids are yeah there's a lot [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1930.42s)]
*  going on the the fentanyl thing is a giant issue it's it's killing a hundred thousand people [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1935.94s)]
*  every year in this country fentanyl overdoses young people and why is I mean you know that's [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1941.46s)]
*  a lot of people it's a lot of people and is is there all right so we now you ever heard of how [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1950.02s)]
*  this is like in response to the opium wars did you ever hear about that that it's in response [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1957.22s)]
*  to the opium wars yes so like so you know I've performed in China a couple times now I'm never [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1962.42s)]
*  going to be able to perform there after saying this but like essentially during the opium wars [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1968.26s)]
*  is like the British were trying to take over China and they were trying to trade and essentially [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1973.46s)]
*  nothing was working so what they essentially did is they got an entire generation of Chinese addicted [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1979.46s)]
*  to opium and they destabilized and then they could take it over and so and the British did a lot of [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1985.94s)]
*  nice things in India and all over the world but this is like one of the things that you know among [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=1994.26s)]
*  the expats in that were performing stand-up in China would tell me about is that like oh yeah [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2002.26s)]
*  this fentanyl is all kind of like revenge for that and that so they they make it they sell it [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2008.98s)]
*  to the you know the cartels of Mexico and it's just going to get in but like so what is the [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2019.54s)]
*  because the the question is what is the motivation behind them doing this is kind of like you hold a [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2026.74s)]
*  grudge you know it's like you literally you know this great nation that has you know [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2033.46s)]
*  thousands year more history than most western countries was essentially the British came in and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2042.5s)]
*  they drugged them and I can just see my comments right now you know nothing you know nothing [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2049.7s)]
*  you know nothing and by the way I do know nothing but this is what it's it's an interesting explanation [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2055.2999999999997s)]
*  right well the opium war is a historical fact yes yeah that's but like but like that that's the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  reasoning behind fentanyl being kind of sold to the cartels and why I think it probably has a factor [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2069.2999999999997s)]
*  and I think another factor is just financial interest it's just so cheap right so cheap [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2078.9s)]
*  they make the the precursors they they bring them over to Mexico they sell them to the cartels and [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2083.54s)]
*  they produce fentanyl and the United States has a massive appetite for illegal drugs and it's also [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2089.38s)]
*  part of the war on drugs because of the fact that's illegal it's very difficult to get and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2096.02s)]
*  you have to get it from criminals so it pumps up the criminals so the the cartels make insane [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2100.34s)]
*  amounts of money and they have a business and bringing stuff across the border into America [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2105.62s)]
*  there's a there's also a financial interest in the fact that fentanyl is very cheap and it's very [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2112.02s)]
*  potent so you don't need a lot of it and you can lace things with fentanyl so when people are buying [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2117.7799999999997s)]
*  like street xanax or street MDMA a lot of is laced a lot of is laced to provide additional effects [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  so that it's effective even though it's watered down and cut down like the cocaine you know they [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2131.94s)]
*  cut it and they add fentanyl to it and a lot of people are dying from the fentanyl [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2137.06s)]
*  that's insane it's insane i mean and we live through the the crack era yeah which is nothing [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2140.82s)]
*  was like crack is like there's the the devastating effects of it and so it's nothing compared to [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2147.14s)]
*  fentanyl and math we live through math yeah you know math's really got to pick up their game [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2155.2999999999997s)]
*  well aderall took their their fucking death throne now everyone's on aderall you can get [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2161.78s)]

*  like this is amazing you get out and immediately you get this rush of endorphins this rush of [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2317.22s)]
*  norepinephrine and dopamine and it lasts for hours they say it's a 200 200 increase in dopamine that [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2323.4599999999996s)]

*  it's your body responding to this imminent threat of death so it produces these anti-inflammatory [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=2342.26s)]

*  just it's difficult like you have to work you have to do some work like with stand-up you have [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3465.7s)]
*  to write you have to perform you have to really think about it you have to edit your act and put [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3469.8599999999997s)]

*  of our population that does things they don't want to do all day every day and that's one of [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3479.62s)]
*  the reasons why people drink so much they come home and they just want a break like they just [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3484.1s)]
*  don't want to be there anymore they want to change their state yeah yeah yeah they're escaping [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3488.5s)]
*  brutal yeah i mean that is the life that a lot of people choose when they choose security they [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3495.7s)]
*  choose something like oh if i do this i can make that and i do this then i could buy a house and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3501.46s)]
*  i would do that i could buy a boat i do this then i could get that and they're all day long watching [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3505.9399999999996s)]
*  that clock wanting to get the fuck out of there and then they get out of there they go home they [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3512.02s)]
*  just oh give me a drink and their family's complaining and the wife is pissed because [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3516.4199999999996s)]

*  something about i mean i don't think we even there's probably people that understand this but like [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3533.22s)]
*  this outrage machine is it serves such a purpose and i'm talking about both sides like you know [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3539.22s)]
*  fucking trump fucking biden there is like this there is this thing that like it serves something [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3549.3s)]
*  in us that is probably not healthy definitely not healthy right and it's it's certainly not [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3558.26s)]
*  constructive do you know i mean like i feel as though you know with comedians we are so used to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3566.34s)]
*  being around and i but we're so used to being around people of different points of view [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3574.1s)]
*  and different sensibilities that we grow to love that it's not completely foreign to like i remember [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3581.14s)]
*  at fourth of july i had a friend that was like at occupy wall street and then i had a friend [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3591.06s)]
*  who works at fox news and they were there and they've known each other for 30 years and it was [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3596.98s)]
*  nothing it was it was not an issue it was interesting i mean i was asking them questions [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3602.02s)]
*  you know i'm like all right so what's going on here yeah and uh but there is something maybe [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3608.5s)]
*  it's because comedians are misfits because i say that also and i sometimes think like [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3615.14s)]
*  sometimes people in the entertainment industry are like you know my business is so weird when [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3620.9s)]
*  the reality is you know in a bank in you know in a construction site there's people of [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3625.22s)]
*  dramatically different opinions too and they got to go along to get along right yeah but i don't [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3633.62s)]
*  know well people like being in opposition of other people and they like thinking that those [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3640.18s)]
*  people on that other side are keeping them from living the dream or keeping you know this country [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3644.98s)]
*  from being great or keeping you know people from prospering and keeping democracy alive and if we [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3649.86s)]
*  don't defeat them we're fucked and they like having this like wild cause and there's some [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3657.06s)]
*  validity to it i mean there's a lot of real challenging issues in this country like real [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3662.1s)]
*  dangerous scary issues and there's a lot of financial interests that are tied up in these [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3666.34s)]
*  dangerous scary issues and they will avoid solutions because they're profiting off of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3671.38s)]
*  the problem itself well there's a lot of that going on yeah that's a lot of the homeless problem [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3677.06s)]
*  that's a lot of there's a lot of issues in this country that you could pick one side or another [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3682.1s)]
*  and just decide the other those people are the problem it's insanely complicated it's insanely [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3686.74s)]
*  interwoven and complex and you know to just to you know reduce it down to the right versus the left [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3692.66s)]
*  and we're the good guys and they're the bad guys it's like it's that's such a stupid perspective [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3701.7799999999997s)]
*  and you're being played you're being played by the media you're being played by politicians you know [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3706.66s)]
*  it's like manufactured outrage recreational outrage and it's just a giant distraction [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3711.54s)]
*  it's constantly going on and then there's ufos yeah what's why is it that the ufo thing [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3717.14s)]
*  comes up every couple months where they're like there's ufos and then like a half hour later [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3724.42s)]
*  did you see the new colts uniform you like we're so easily distracted by really unimportant [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3731.06s)]
*  things from like stuff that you know is is the theme of every sci-fi movie right is we're so [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3739.46s)]

*  necessarily i think it's just that human beings are just like goldfish i think we forget for sure [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3767.2999999999997s)]
*  yeah that's right oh that's right we definitely are but then there's also people that take [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3775.38s)]
*  advantage of that and i think there's definitely calculated news releases and leaks that they put [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3779.7799999999997s)]
*  out to distract us from other complicated things that are also going on simultaneously [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3786.1s)]
*  the fascinating thing about the ufo thing is because if this had happened in like the 1980s [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3790.9s)]
*  it would be front page of every newspaper everyone would be talking about it at work everyone we [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=3795.94s)]

*  for president in 1988 he got caught plagiarizing yeah a whole speech so when not just one i think [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4494.66s)]
*  it was more than one oh really and then and also i think there was some other evidence of plagiarism [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4499.86s)]
*  in his past so we used to do a night at stitches where like you would do my act i would do your act [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4504.099999999999s)]

*  this is in 1988 but i don't know maybe this all right this is what i think i think that if trump [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4517.219999999999s)]
*  i think that i think that if trump goes away i think biden's gonna go see ya you guys take over [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4524.98s)]
*  that's what i naively but trump's not going to go away i mean they would have to put him in jail [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4533.299999999999s)]
*  and it doesn't seem like they're able to do that the the the what are the charges now what are [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4540.0199999999995s)]

*  like you know in the era of jfk that would be like how dare you bring that up yeah so um 37 felony [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4600.18s)]
*  counts are mishandling classified documents and impending investigations now what i've heard about [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4607.78s)]
*  this is these counts are inflated so there's a bunch of counts but they multiply those accounts [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4613.139999999999s)]
*  based on the amount of documents and things so it becomes all these different counts i'm talking on [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4620.099999999999s)]
*  my ass here i know i know but some of it is like but that's and so two other ongoing criminal probes [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4626.179999999999s)]
*  both related to 2020 election interference those are serious yeah may prop further indictments [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4631.7s)]
*  january 6 thing is pretty bad well the january 6 thing is bad but also the intelligence agencies [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4636.74s)]
*  were involved in provoking people to go into the capitol building that's a fact do so wait a minute [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4644.98s)]
*  you're you're saying that that guy what's his name ray epps yeah you really think that i don't know [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4649.7s)]
*  i don't know but i do know that every other parent i think he's gonna sue fox i think every other [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4655.94s)]
*  person who was involved in january 6 who was involved in coordinating a break in into the [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4663.54s)]
*  capitol and in instigating people breaking they all were all arrested this guy wasn't not only that [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4670.5s)]
*  they were defending him in the new york times the washington post those different things because [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4675.219999999999s)]
*  saying that fox news is unjustly accused him of instigating well he clearly instigated he did it [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4678.74s)]
*  on camera i don't know if he was a fed i know a lot of people think he was a fed the people that [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4686.179999999999s)]
*  were there were calling him a fed what i do know is when they asked the fbi the fbi said we can't [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4690.5s)]
*  tell you whether or not there were people that were there that were doing that now there's been [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4696.58s)]
*  reports that there was hundreds of agents that were there that were doing that i don't know if [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4701.86s)]
*  that's true either but i do know that they do use agent provocateurs to disrupt peace peaceful [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4706.98s)]
*  protests it's a common tactic what they do is say if there's a like the world trade organization is [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4713.94s)]
*  a great example that was in i think the 90s in seattle and so what they did was they were [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4721.54s)]
*  protesting the world trade organization they were doing it peacefully it was a big problem [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4726.9s)]
*  so what they did is they sent in allegedly agent provocateurs they started smashing buildings and [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4730.74s)]
*  lighting things on fire now it's not a peaceful protest now they could bring in the police now [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4735.78s)]
*  they can start arresting people and then they created a no protest zone where literally if you [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4740.42s)]
*  had a pin on your jacket that was the wto with a red line through it they would not let you cross [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4744.9s)]
*  you could not cross with a pin that was against the wto and and go to work there was a no protest [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4750.5s)]
*  zone so they they silenced protest which is a part of our freedom of speech so this is a tactic [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4757.62s)]
*  that some government agencies use to stop but but wait a minute all right so what you're saying is [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4764.34s)]
*  on january 6th that uh this event that obviously trump organized forget about the juliani stuff and [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4769.38s)]
*  the uh you know whether they thought that it was he definitely encouraged people to protest yes [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4779.22s)]
*  but all right so you're saying that like the the fbi and nancy pelosi and i'm not saying nancy no [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4785.86s)]
*  but like you're saying that like they're like you know we'll make this uh instead of uh an awkward [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4793.94s)]
*  protest we'll encourage it so that it'll be it'll backfire on trump rather than being this rising [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4802.099999999999s)]
*  of people that uh believe that there was election corruption i think it's certainly i think that [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4812.5s)]
*  would be hard you think it's possible i think it's possible you don't think it's wait a minute [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4819.46s)]
*  you think it's hard to do i think that you know that the fbi or the cia saying hey you know trump [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4823.7s)]
*  lost this because here's what you're kind of implying trump lost the election he is such a [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4833.38s)]
*  an amazing communicator and he's convinced this loyal base that there was election interference [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4840.34s)]
*  we don't want them to protest how we can end this is if we encourage people to go beyond [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4849.14s)]
*  protesting to essentially go into the capital and take a shit in the hallway i mean i'm exaggerating [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4857.9400000000005s)]
*  a little bit yeah but like i don't see why that would be of use like i'm more suspicious why [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4865.22s)]
*  trump didn't call for backup when you know or you know for uh the for the [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4874.42s)]
*  capital police you know i mean it's like there was and that like michael flinn's brother was [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4883.54s)]
*  you know i mean like there's there's way more conspiracy stuff against trump and you know then [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4890.5s)]
*  i think the the slim likelihood that people were like oh trump's a problem let's just get these [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4899.94s)]
*  people that are loyal to trump to run into the capital so that we can arrest 300 people does [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4908.259999999999s)]
*  that make sense no no it doesn't make sense no i think it's a standard tactic especially when [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4914.099999999999s)]
*  someone is the enemy of the intelligence agencies with trump that's absolutely the case trump set [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4919.62s)]
*  himself up against the intelligence agencies he did it openly and he did it brazenly and a lot [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4925.14s)]
*  of people think it's very dangerous like the intelligence agencies are very important you [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4931.3s)]
*  know you want to find out what's going on in other countries you want to find out what the threats to [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4935.46s)]
*  america are you want to find out what terrorist activities are going to be taking place and stop [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4938.42s)]
*  them before you know jfk had his problem with the intelligence agencies yeah well yeah i mean look [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4943.700000000001s)]
*  it's unchecked power right it's that's the deep state it's unchecked power and i think trump was [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4948.580000000001s)]
*  very open about his disdain for the intelligence agencies he created enemies in the intelligence [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4954.74s)]
*  agencies it's standard for intelligence agencies in this country to encourage agent provocateurs [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4960.0199999999995s)]
*  or to employ agent provocateurs and so you're saying when he was in house sinkie and he was [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4967.219999999999s)]
*  saying i believe putin more than my intelligence community that was something the intelligence [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4971.62s)]
*  community was like we're going to get him well i think they were going to get him in any way [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4978.179999999999s)]
*  that they could because he's an enemy of the intelligence agencies and he was openly talking [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4983.46s)]
*  about them being incompetent and being corrupt and he you know he fired komi and you know he was [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4990.18s)]
*  against the fbi and you know look it's a very dangerous thing you talk to people that are [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=4996.9s)]
*  intelligence agencies like it's a very dangerous thing for a president to be at war with the [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5001.06s)]
*  intelligence agencies and to do it so publicly and i think it's without a doubt when you have [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5005.22s)]
*  a gigantic massive protest that a lot of people think is a threat to democracy you have these [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5012.98s)]
*  people that are saying the election was rigged and they're on the capital lawn they're screaming [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5017.78s)]
*  and yelling i don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that they would encourage people [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5022.259999999999s)]
*  to do things that were unlawful instead of peacefully protesting which is what everybody [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5027.459999999999s)]
*  was doing on the outside which is totally legal to take that and escalate it to entering into the [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5031.94s)]
*  capital now you can lock things down and now you have real clear evidence that this president is [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5037.22s)]
*  responsible for this insurrection attempt and this is dangerous this is a threat to our democracy and [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5044.1s)]
*  he's never going to be president again we're going to indict him we're going to go after him we're [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5050.02s)]
*  going to do all these different things i think it's not it's not like it's there's a lot of [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5053.38s)]
*  shenanigans going on on both sides it's not like a clear cut like he shouldn't have done that [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5058.9800000000005s)]
*  and they should have done this it's like there's a lot of fuckery and there's a lot that's been [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5064.58s)]
*  going on throughout history whenever people have unchecked power and unchecked influence and they [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5069.62s)]
*  have enemies and trump was their enemy yeah but i just and i'm not saying that there isn't uh you [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5076.82s)]
*  know you know it's kind of like did you see the hearings when when they were grilling the fbi as [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5084.74s)]
*  to whether or not they had intelligence agencies there or whether they had some of it yeah it's [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5088.9s)]
*  crazy because instead of saying no we don't do that that's illegal they said we can't answer that [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5095.219999999999s)]
*  yeah but i think even you know and and again i'm not saying that there isn't corruption on both [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5101.62s)]
*  sides but like in the end for me personally it's like when people complain about biden's you know [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5107.62s)]
*  age or his cognitive decline or whatever i'm like the alternative to me is not acceptable [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5114.820000000001s)]
*  the alternative being donald trump yes and what's what's least acceptable about that as opposed to [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5123.700000000001s)]
*  hunter biden and and joe biden and all the corruption that we know for sure well i think [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5129.62s)]
*  look you know joe biden's relationship with his son or uh you know who obviously struggles with [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5134.58s)]
*  addiction i mean look half of our friends struggle with addiction it's like you know he's a [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5142.58s)]
*  compassionate father is there some of that like um some you know uh let's make some money with [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5147.78s)]
*  uh our influence uh after after we left office or during office when he was vice president [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5156.26s)]
*  senator or stuff like that is there some of that yeah it seems like there's a lot of that but [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5163.14s)]
*  compared to trump compared to like jared getting a two billion dollar contract compared to like um [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5168.66s)]
*  you know like even the documents like the the documents that like biden had or or pens had [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5178.099999999999s)]
*  versus like trump literally showing the documents some of them being of i think we're going to find [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5188.74s)]
*  out being really inconsequential i'm not saying he was selling them i'm not saying i don't know [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5195.38s)]
*  if he was you know it was like a big swinging dick move i think that's different than um you know [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5201.14s)]
*  pence having some documents in his house that he shouldn't have um but you mean pence or biden [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5209.14s)]
*  pence had documents yeah i think anybody's really concentrating on pence but like i by the way i i do [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5216.74s)]
*  want to make clear that i do have the approach of like i could find something out and be like [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5222.82s)]
*  all right but like there is part of me that's like it's very little doubt in my mind that [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5228.98s)]
*  that trump is the the most corrupt and uh you know you know was you know like just the the uh [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5236.259999999999s)]
*  uh you know it's not you know like andrew jackson was like uh you know did horrible things but like [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5248.26s)]
*  i don't begrudge someone having kind of like kick ass and take take no prisoners kind of attitude [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5255.14s)]
*  it's you know it's not the style it's just i think that there's repeated corruption i mean like i [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5262.1s)]
*  there's repeated corruption with the biden administration the the the corruption with [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5268.34s)]
*  his son first of all his son struggling with addiction that's not my concern i mean i i [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5272.1s)]
*  it sucks it sucks when if you have a kid that's a that's hooked on crack and a fucking complete [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5278.1s)]
*  disaster and he pulls himself out of it congratulations for him and that's not what i it's the corruption [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5283.38s)]
*  it's the the clear influence by foreign agents and you don't think trump has more corruption i [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5289.14s)]
*  don't think there's evidence the same way there's evidence right now because of the laptop and [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5295.3s)]
*  because of the recorded conversations there's real evidence that they were getting money from [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5299.3s)]
*  other countries what about trump university what about oh yeah no no no no no no no no no no no no [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5305.62s)]
*  i'm not saying that he's clean i'm not saying that he's clean but i'm saying to dismiss the biden [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5310.1s)]
*  corruption that biden's way more guilty of corruption not saying that i'm not saying that [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5314.98s)]
*  you're saying they're equal i'm saying they're both corrupt and i'm saying that to say that [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5319.3s)]

*  and i'm more likely to think that trump is satan i think biden is a product of a very corrupt [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5735.54s)]
*  business that has been corrupt for a long time and he's just not that good at being discrete about it [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5742.34s)]

*  been involved in some shady shit you know the trump university thing is a good one but he's also a guy [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=5801.54s)]

*  that right yeah yeah so there's a lot of shitty things going on all simultaneously happening and [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6524.66s)]
*  you know we're supposed to be the beacon of democracy for the world we're supposed to be [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6532.34s)]
*  the greatest example of the experiment of self-government the world's ever known [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6537.7s)]
*  and we're being influenced and and manipulated left and right constantly i mean there's [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6542.74s)]
*  there's can you there's there's this one group that is pretty uh jennifer laurence does this [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6550.26s)]
*  thing it's like some uh kind of uh i worked with uh uh ed uh helms and there's this it's this [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6556.26s)]
*  non-partisan group that is all about uh you know like for instance getting rid of gerrymandering [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6567.78s)]
*  um you know uh rank choice voting you know it's some of the andrew yang stuff it's like all this [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6574.42s)]
*  non-partisan things that conservatives and liberals and moderates essentially all you know [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6582.34s)]
*  because essentially what's happening now is that 70 of the american public will want [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6590.18s)]
*  uh one thing to happen and our our government officials will not do it because they're so [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6597.54s)]
*  beholden to special interests and so it's like we really don't have a representative democracy [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6605.780000000001s)]
*  right it's pretty scary it is scary yeah it's money you have to take money out of politics and [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6613.46s)]
*  how do you do that like imagine trying to go in there and untangle that bag of wires right or [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6619.22s)]
*  saying you know next elect next presidential election is only going to be six weeks [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6624.26s)]
*  and then the tv places are going to be like but with it there's commercials we make all our money [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6629.700000000001s)]
*  yeah you know it's so it's kind of two sides of it it's like it's also like the pharmaceutical [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6634.34s)]
*  commercials you know they're i think they're only legal in the u.s and new zealand yeah but new [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6643.06s)]
*  zealand's far more restrictive than the u.s too but if they got rid of them you know hey all right [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6649.06s)]
*  we got it i guess we got to get rid of half our channels well they probably would and that [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6656.34s)]
*  probably would be good and then it would be the rise of independent news sources and real [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6661.54s)]
*  journalism which you're seeing more on the internet now than you're seeing in mainstream media [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6666.26s)]
*  you know independent news sources on the internet are far more reliable in my opinion than what [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6670.660000000001s)]
*  you're seeing on fox news or on ns msnbc is the what you get on those is you know sanctioned [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6675.46s)]
*  propaganda and when you get on independent channels is people that don't have a vested [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6682.34s)]
*  interest they're not being controlled by corporate interest and they have the ability to whether [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6687.94s)]
*  it's guys like jimmy door or whether it's breaking points they have the ability to talk about things [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6692.02s)]
*  in a complex way and look at them on both sides and find out what what the influence is and where [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6697.38s)]
*  the corruption is and and talk about it publicly and openly and because of that because this is [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6703.3s)]
*  the these are the only sources that are available now is independent sources where people are [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6708.26s)]
*  individuals that you can trust because you know they don't lie they might have their biases but [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6712.820000000001s)]
*  they're not being influenced by corporations yeah but like i do sit there and i think [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6717.06s)]
*  the lesson of fox news is i remember when fox news kind of rose and they were you know like [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6722.5s)]
*  they started with the mainstream media kind of language is that what i learned is oh it's [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6731.38s)]
*  impossible for a human being whether it be walter cronkite or jesse waters to deliver a a sentence [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6737.9400000000005s)]
*  of news information without kind of having their personality there it's impossible for it to be [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6746.34s)]
*  completely objective do you know i mean even the most boring newscaster it's like well now they're [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6753.3s)]
*  downplaying this riot you know i mean there there was a riot you know because cnn used to be like [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6759.62s)]
*  that it used to be a very talky head right and um but i don't know it's weird because i think it's [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6765.0599999999995s)]
*  hard to for something to be completely objective it's very hard it's almost impossible well one of [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=6772.18s)]

*  because they can eat gluten-free pasta they don't have any problems but it's also which interesting [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7131.7s)]
*  is and many people talk about this when you go to italy and you eat pasta over there you don't have [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7136.34s)]
*  the same reaction because they don't have the same bread they don't have the same wheat they have [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7140.42s)]
*  they have heirloom wheat so their wheat has never been genetically modified they have the same wheat [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7147.0599999999995s)]
*  they've had for hundreds of years so when you eat bread and pasta it's not the best thing in the [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7151.94s)]

*  the same people don't pay at the end so it's all money it's all money there's higher yield [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7213.54s)]
*  it's more money we're gonna have to pay for medical costs right but they're not paying [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7218.34s)]
*  other people okay so the the people that are involved in the industry that makes wheat makes [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7221.86s)]
*  corn makes these different things all they're thinking about is maximizing profits so in the [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7226.42s)]
*  pursuit of maximizing profits they create an item that's worse for your health and they don't care [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7231.3s)]
*  so it's up to you so as long as there's other options as long as other options are readily [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7236.9s)]

*  corporation a corporation's obligation is to their shareholders so they have to continue to [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7252.74s)]
*  make more money and they make decisions that would maximize profit and in doing so a lot of times [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7258.98s)]
*  they're making a product that's worse for your health than the original product but it lasts on [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7265.86s)]
*  the shelf longer you get higher yield for acreage and that's what they do it's all money now there's [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7271.0599999999995s)]
*  certain people that have recognized that and have changed their farms like i had will harris from [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7277.46s)]
*  white oaks pastures on the podcast a fascinating guy and he had an industrial farm that his family [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7283.46s)]
*  is running forever and over the course of 20 years converted it to a regenerative farm and a [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7288.74s)]
*  natural farm where it's all organic and no pesticides no herbicides when they have a [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7294.42s)]
*  problem with like some sort of invasive insect they bring in another insect that kills those [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7299.9400000000005s)]
*  that's not the guy who did uh biggest little farm documentary that's an amazing is that joe [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7305.46s)]
*  salatin is joe salatin the biggest little farm that's a guy from poly face farms who's also a [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7311.3s)]
*  regenerative uh agricultural expert who i've also had on the podcast this guy who did this i think [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7316.26s)]
*  he was like a dp and his wife they lived in la and but it's by the way it's really fascinating [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7321.54s)]
*  because that's that's the whole thing of like okay you've got a snail problem uh buy some ducks and [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7328.5s)]

*  you know what i mean so it's like it's full circle blithe thing yeah yeah well the way will [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7344.58s)]
*  harris describes it he's like essentially you're reproducing nature in a controlled environment [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7350.98s)]
*  so instead of applying pesticides and herbicides and chemicals and toxins which leads to horrific [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7356.34s)]
*  runoff like yeah one of the things that we've showed on this podcast multiple times is [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7362.42s)]
*  they documented how their farm is connected to industrialized farms and industrialized farm [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7366.66s)]
*  right next to it and the river runs through both properties but there is a clear line [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7371.54s)]
*  where the runoff from this industrial farm is just this brown pollutants that's going into the [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7378.98s)]
*  river because it's industrial fertilizer and on his side the water is clear because on his side [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7385.86s)]
*  he doesn't use any of that stuff and they have fertile topsoil because during the regenerative [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7391.22s)]
*  farming practices of using manure the cows only eat grass and that this all like creates its own [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7396.34s)]
*  natural fertilizer and then you have the pigs which are roaming and foraging and you have the [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7404.9800000000005s)]
*  chickens that are roaming and foraging and then you grow the vegetables with that manure as [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7410.42s)]
*  fertilizer and then everything sort of has this place yeah and it it it recreates what a natural [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7415.46s)]
*  environment would be it's just contained it's just fenced in and many many many acres and it's all [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7422.74s)]
*  like this yeah recreation of nature natural method that's how people should live yeah that's what [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7428.099999999999s)]
*  we're supposed to be eating and you know russia has banned gmo foods well i feel like europe europe [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7434.26s)]
*  has done that too they should well and we should probably do it here and then by the way genetically [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7440.5s)]
*  modified doesn't necessarily mean bad you know there's been genetic modifications that have led [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7444.82s)]
*  to superior nutrition and i think that's the case with i believe it's golden rice or it's a more [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7450.74s)]
*  nutritious more protein rich rice and it led to many more people not dying of famine and starvation [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7456.66s)]
*  and there's there's different things that can be done to foods that make them superior you know [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7463.46s)]
*  it's not all negative but pesticides and herbicides like on whole like pretty much are terrible and [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7468.82s)]
*  they're terrible because they're poison they kill weeds they kill they're also they're also you know [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7476.9s)]
*  if and i just know this for just from my limited experience in gardening it's just the quick fix [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7483.0599999999995s)]
*  it's not even the fix right so it's like if you have aphids you should just get ladybugs right [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7490.099999999999s)]
*  but that brings us back it brings us back to money because what is the cheapest way to do this is [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7496.98s)]
*  going to get the highest yield or the highest yield is genetically modified organisms with [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7503.3s)]
*  pesticides and herbicides yeah and then you just get massive amounts of crops monocrop agriculture [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7507.38s)]
*  which is totally unnatural it's totally unnatural to have a thousand acres of just corn growing in [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7513.14s)]
*  a place it doesn't happen in the wild well i think it was also the sapiens there was something also [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7517.700000000001s)]
*  about farming that you know all right so you could feed a lot of people where we had the corn and we [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7522.900000000001s)]
*  had the potatoes but that's all they ate was the potatoes they didn't eat anything else whereas [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7530.9s)]
*  like before that before farming people would forage and yeah there was a variety to the diet and there [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7537.0599999999995s)]
*  was more nutrition if you had food and you also had a lot of starvation because sometimes you [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7543.0599999999995s)]
*  weren't successful yeah and then you know they would have climate issues or issues with crops [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7547.78s)]
*  dying and then you're fucked well by the way so like the you're only supposed to have one meal a [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7554.66s)]
*  day right well only isn't like breakfast the most important meal that's all bs that's all the food [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7561.139999999999s)]
*  pyramid that's all kind of the food how do we sell some milk well the food pyramids horseshit [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7568.34s)]
*  because the bottom of it is all green you know it's just bullshit but that's what they thought at [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7573.94s)]
*  one point in time that that was like the staple of a good diet it's not a conspiracy they thought [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7578.34s)]
*  that that was the way to do it you know and they were taught that in school that that was the way [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7582.98s)]
*  to do it you know they just would they got bad information and now we understand that's probably [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7587.139999999999s)]
*  not the way to do it and the right way to do it is to eat real food to eat real organic vegetables [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7592.259999999999s)]
*  real organic meat and fish and then you know the fish thing it's like how much mercury poisoning [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7597.7s)]
*  is in the fish how much heavy metal toxins are in the fish like what kind of environment with these [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7603.62s)]
*  fish growing up in you know there's like if you eat a lot of fish you can get sick like there's [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7607.54s)]
*  people that have gotten sick from eating too much sushi yeah it's crazy it's just and there's just [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7615.22s)]
*  also just so much there used to be so many fish and i don't know if you've seen that map of like [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7621.46s)]
*  just the gulf of mexico it's like oh it's devastated we've we've i don't know what the numbers are let's [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7628.82s)]
*  find out what percentage of fish have been removed from the ocean over the last 50 years [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7634.42s)]
*  let's find that out well by the way i bet it's nuts when i wrote this book about i had all these [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7641.78s)]
*  jokes on oysters and how they were because you know that long island oyster bay it was called [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7647.78s)]
*  oyster bed because there were oysters everywhere and so like when people would come to new york city [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7654.26s)]
*  when they when people would go to boston they'd get lobster when they come to new york city they [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7659.14s)]
*  get clams and oysters and now it's like but we just gobbled through all the oysters on long island [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7663.38s)]
*  and i think that like worldwide we've eaten through 90 percent of the clams and oysters [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7671.78s)]
*  that existed isn't that unbelievable it's insane because it happened so quickly we think humans [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7678.58s)]
*  have been around for hundreds of thousands of years and over the last few decades we ate all [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7685.62s)]
*  the clams yeah just like all of them all the lobster and also all the fish you know i i played [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7690.5s)]
*  this character that worked at a fish refiner i didn't realize it all the streams all the lakes [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7697.22s)]
*  they're just farmed fish because we destroyed the ecosystems in these things where we gobbled up all [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7704.1s)]
*  the fish so then we have to put like bass into these lakes that i don't even know if they were [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7710.18s)]
*  2048 no more fish oh my god the current state of overfishing continues the world's oceans will be [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7716.42s)]
*  emptied for fish by 2048 what wow is that real oceans are massively overfished only 15 percent [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7722.42s)]
*  of the world's fisheries are relative and a relatively good condition the remaining 85 percent [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7733.94s)]
*  are fully or over exploited depleted or in a fragile state of recovery from exploitation [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7739.3s)]
*  there are no signs of things improving the planet's fishing fleet is two to three times larger than what [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7746.1s)]
*  oceans can support wow 97.4 percent of pacific bluefin tuna gone holy shit right just there the [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7751.78s)]
*  bluefin tuna are at just 2.6 percent of its historic population holy fuck [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7762.42s)]
*  by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the world's ocean measured by weight [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7770.82s)]
*  wow yeah i mean it's it's but those it's the fish eating the the plastic yeah that is the [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7776.82s)]
*  well it's also the pollution i mean that we've had a boy in slot on the podcast he's a young [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7784.82s)]
*  man who created an invention to siphon the plastic out of the water to filter the plastic [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7791.3s)]
*  out of the water and then they take that plastic and make things out of it they make like eyeglasses [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7797.3s)]
*  and stuff like that out of it it's pretty interesting because he's got this machine that [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7802.02s)]
*  goes over the pacific garbage patch that giant fucking enormous size of the state of texas [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7806.820000000001s)]
*  and they just scoop up this plastic and then they they carry it out and then they take that plastic [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7813.22s)]
*  and convert it into usable goods i mean that's where i don't understand the america there's this [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7820.26s)]
*  ocean cleanup thing so he has this machine that they is really young guy i mean i think he made [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7826.42s)]
*  this invention when he was 19 years old brilliant brilliant guy we've had him on twice right yeah [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7832.58s)]
*  but uh salute to him so this machine and they've refined it over the years they've they've employed [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7839.22s)]
*  multiple ones of it now and they're using them to clean up oceans and rivers and they just scoop [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7845.78s)]
*  up the plastic and they take that plastic and recycle it there is a certain cynicism because [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7850.82s)]
*  like as somebody was like and then we're going to find out you know it's like and then that [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7856.5s)]
*  what what they're doing is they're creating a accidentally creating a monster that's because [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7861.3s)]
*  but like there is so much human ingenuity i can't figure i can't i can't understand why [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7868.0199999999995s)]
*  because there's also a water shortage why we can't you know the three-fourths of the planet is or [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7875.54s)]
*  maybe i don't know five-eighths or whatever is water but it's salt water right so how and like [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7882.74s)]
*  the water rights thing it's like we can't figure out how to get the salt out of the water well we [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7889.14s)]
*  certainly can but it's too expensive right i don't know uh i don't know why they haven't done that i [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7895.86s)]
*  know that california was working on desalination plants and that was something that was discussed [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7901.94s)]
*  i mean if anybody needs water it's fucking california right yeah i mean what about phoenix [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7906.42s)]
*  yeah right yeah i mean if they could figure that out we'd probably drain the water out of the ocean [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7910.74s)]
*  within 50 years and they'd be like there's no more water left in the ocean and there'd be like [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7915.94s)]
*  giant fucking water parks in kansas [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7920.1s)]

*  well no some of it is if we could you know like fresh water is so key yeah but i guess do you [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7931.46s)]
*  think that there is something of the environmental crisis that people have an attitude of like yeah [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7940.1s)]
*  we'll figure it out yeah we'll figure it out at the end i think it's like what we were talking [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7948.34s)]
*  about earlier with so many things to think about there's so much going on and there's a few people [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=7953.22s)]

*  and because of the way structures are created these these corporate structures they have an obligation [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=8290.58s)]
*  to make more money every year more money every quarter that's if they don't do that they'll get [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=8296.9s)]

*  you're never going to get a completely pure like ethical moral enlightened structure that's running [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9068.1s)]
*  a capitalist society that is so overwhelmingly influenced by money and special interest groups [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9075.460000000001s)]
*  it's a matter of mitigating all those things to the maximum amount possible while exposing [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9081.62s)]
*  fraud as much as possible and then putting checks and balances in place to make sure that fraud [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9087.54s)]
*  and that that corruption can't get to the place where it's at now in the future how do you do that [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9093.94s)]
*  well you have to take money out of politics good fucking luck you have to take money out of [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9099.460000000001s)]

*  their medical issues could be mitigated by exercise and diet a lot of them a large percentage of them [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9115.300000000001s)]

*  tell you but is it i i agree with you but is there also something of every generation of humans [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9137.62s)]
*  looks at the previous generation of tests those idiots of course they were putting leeches on [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9146.58s)]
*  people yeah come on we've got to figure it out just take these bag of pills yeah do you [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9151.46s)]
*  know i mean so it's but in some cases we don't have pills are good for you yeah i know but we [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9156.74s)]
*  don't have the humility i think to admit you know even even the uh you know the um you know the uh [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9161.14s)]
*  the covid coming from uh you know the the lab the lab league theory i think that it wasn't [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9170.98s)]
*  some conspiracy it was kind of like we have our narrative and people defend the narrative it's [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9180.1s)]
*  not like even one side or the other side it's like look what do you mean meaning like it's a human [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9187.54s)]
*  trait to sit there and go okay well all right so we don't want world war three so it wasn't [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9195.38s)]
*  china it's just like look it's it's a i don't think that's the case with the lab league theory [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9200.9s)]
*  i think you think that was real clear evidence that they knew and you think that fauchi covered [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9205.3s)]
*  it up because he had given money well there's emails there's emails where they're talking [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9210.74s)]
*  about did that did china leak it on purpose no i don't think so i think well that lab had [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9216.1s)]
*  safety violations the people in the lab got sick is it have you seen the photos yeah they built it [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9222.02s)]
*  on like an island yeah they spent a lot of money trying to invest in their infrastructure yeah well [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9229.060000000001s)]
*  whatever they were doing we were partly funding it wow yeah and they were doing gain of function [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9235.460000000001s)]
*  research on coronaviruses and i think people in that lab got sick and i think they spread it out [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9240.980000000001s)]
*  to the world and i think fauchi covered it up and i think there's real clear evidence [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9246.18s)]
*  there's real clear evidence in terms of email chain where the original doctors who had the [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9251.3s)]
*  scientists that are examined it said it appears to be have leaked from a lab these appear to be [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9256.179999999998s)]
*  manipulated viruses and then they get emails from fauchi and then within days they change their tune [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9261.06s)]
*  and then they get funded but i'm not even disagreeing with that approach what i'm saying is that like [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9266.5s)]
*  the the general resist it doesn't exist right now the lab leak theory resistance but the general [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9274.02s)]
*  resistance to that is a very human kind of reaction to something where it's like well obviously it's [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9282.1s)]
*  kind of like the um america's hesitation to looking at some of its hard facts about our our you know [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9292.58s)]
*  this this experiment that we've undertaken which is you know understanding like being [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9302.339999999998s)]
*  able to look yourself in the mirror like the lab leak theory is is in a way the most logical [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9309.38s)]
*  solution yes right but also like the you know and i'm drawing this comparison so like america [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9317.619999999999s)]
*  lived after world war ii under this belief system that hey we're a country of immigrants [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9326.5s)]
*  we all these immigrants came over we're a melting pot isn't it great anyway uh and a story what of [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9334.34s)]
*  course that's not the reality the reality is that the wealth of this nation was built off of slavery [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9340.58s)]
*  and about you know many you know of stealing land from native americans and so like there is like a [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9347.86s)]
*  resistance to embracing that knowledge so similar to the lab leak theory whether [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9355.54s)]
*  fauci caused it or whatever there is a general tendency to not want to look at a hard fact that [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9361.460000000001s)]
*  might not be comfortable definitely for people that were involved definitely for people that were [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9369.86s)]
*  responsible of it for it and you know it also makes you feel like you're on the right side of [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9375.7s)]
*  things if you can come with i mean even if you don't believe them if you can say some facts and [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9381.539999999999s)]
*  some statistics that seem to point to the fact that it probably was some sort of a natural spillover [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9386.259999999998s)]
*  yeah yeah i mean it also it eliminates this fucking horrible fear that this could happen again [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9392.419999999998s)]
*  you know that that this is a a product of this monkeying around with viruses and [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9398.74s)]
*  fucking around with things and making them more contagious for human beings which is just a [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9404.339999999998s)]
*  dangerous practice that obama had stopped and that was that was some of it was it was it to [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9409.94s)]
*  weaponize it or to kind of who knows i think there's a lot going on there's also just pure [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9416.58s)]
*  financial interests right there's a lot of funding involved if you get billions of dollars from [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9423.140000000001s)]
*  organizations to fund this research and then you have a business involved in funding this research [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9428.42s)]
*  look if their their way of doing that was to come up with some sort of a cure [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9434.82s)]
*  for coronaviruses when they came around well they failed fucking miserably at that [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9440.1s)]
*  because the mitigation efforts were very unsuccessful they weren't prepared they didn't [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9444.82s)]
*  know what to do and they they likely did create something that was way more contagious and wound [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9448.74s)]
*  up killing a shitload of people because it got out yeah that's hard for people to think about and [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9454.58s)]
*  deal with the fact that the the scientific community that was involved in that is responsible for the [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9462.02s)]
*  direct deaths of who knows how many fucking people worldwide that's a terrifying thought yeah i mean [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9467.86s)]
*  that's probably worse than bombing in a comedy club yeah no imagine if you're one of the guys [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9473.86s)]
*  that was involved in that research and you realize that now oh my god holy shit maybe your mom died [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9481.86s)]
*  of it and directly because of stuff that you were working on yeah it's terrifying and people just [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9486.58s)]
*  kind of well i think you know people kind of sit there and go well this is my job this research i [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9493.539999999999s)]
*  don't necessarily understand but i'm doing this yeah and is also money in the cure there's there's [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9498.5s)]
*  money in the treatment and an insane amount of money that that gets pushed around that's when [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9504.82s)]
*  people get real crazy and think that it was leaked on purpose so that they can make money off the [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9509.7s)]
*  treatment which is the most evil way to look at it and that that scares the shit out of me well [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9513.14s)]
*  it is just amazing i mean but like the advancements we've made the fact that we're sitting there [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9519.46s)]
*  complaining about all these 80 year olds running the world is because we've advanced yeah you know [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9526.26s)]
*  because hygiene and nutrition and science and medicine has got us to a point where people can [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9534.26s)]
*  eisenhower you know how old you know he was bald yeah he was he was 21 years old [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9539.46s)]
*  he was a general when he was 12 and he was 21 when he was bald but he was probably like [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9545.859999999999s)]
*  if you if you found out that eisenhower was president he looks like he's 80 how old was [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9552.82s)]
*  eisenhower when he was president i'm gonna i'm gonna guess 59 yeah that's probably about right [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9558.18s)]
*  but he looked like he was 70 he looked he looked like cruz jeff he was 63 [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9565.22s)]
*  63 close enough all right so that was he also had the weight of the world on his shoulders [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9569.22s)]
*  right yeah i mean that's the thing about being a president that like when you see a guy like [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9575.46s)]
*  biden who's already struggling and old yeah that guy looks like he's seen so he also you know he [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9579.7s)]
*  also you know planned you know movements in world war two that he knew would kill 200,000 men [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9585.62s)]
*  200,000 americans are gonna die just imagine that but we gotta get in there you know i mean it's [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9595.46s)]
*  like you look at like the korean war it's like when they invaded and put some it's like it was [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9600.82s)]
*  if you look i don't know if you can like the invasion the where they landed in the korean [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG-l5krNEQ&t=9607.14s)]
